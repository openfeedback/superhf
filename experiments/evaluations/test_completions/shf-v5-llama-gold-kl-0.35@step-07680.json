Hibernating animals are in a deep sleep and don't move very much. They are still alive, but don't need food or water because their body is in a state of hibernation.

The speed of the sound waves determines how loud the sound is. Sound travels faster in hotter air than in cold air. The speed of sound depends on the temperature of the air and the density of the air. The hotter the air, the faster the sound waves travel through it. The cooler the air, the slower the sound waves travel through it. So in cold air, sound waves travel slower and are less likely to make a sound that is loud enough to be heard.", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing.
