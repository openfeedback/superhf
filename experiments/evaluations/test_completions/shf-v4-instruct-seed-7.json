Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: It's a combination of factors. When an object gets wet, it loses its surface tension, so the molecules are moving around more freely. Water is a polar molecule, which means that its molecules have a positive and negative end. So the molecules are attracted to each other, creating more surface area. When the molecules are close together, they are more likely to interact with each other, which causes them to vibrate faster.\n\nWhen the molecules vibrate faster, they emit more heat. And when they are in motion, they are more likely to collide with other", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator in Switzerland.

The right believes in the primacy of the individual and the free market, while the left believes in collectivism and the state.\n\nRight and left political parties have existed since the French Revolution, but they gained popularity in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the rise of socialism, fascism, and communism.\n\nFascism and communism are ideologies that fall on the left side of the political spectrum, while conservatism,", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The way you experience time is not dependent on your location in the universe. Time passes at a constant rate everywhere in the universe.\n\nThe way you experience time is dependent on your location in the universe, because it is based on your motion. If you travel at a constant speed, you will experience time the same way you did before you left, and if you travel at a constant speed in the opposite direction, you will experience time the same way you did before you left.\n\nIf you travel at a constant speed, you will experience time the same way you did before you left, and if you travel at a constant speed", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter was introduced in 1793 by a Frenchman, Antoine Lavoisier, who was a chemist. At the time, it was defined as 1/10,000,000 of the distance from the equator to the North Pole. In 1983, it was redefined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of light in a vacuum emitted by a certain transition of the cesium atom. The meter was originally defined as the distance from the North Pole to the equator. This was", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The pain you feel when you get soap in your eye is caused by the eye's tear ducts and nerve endings. When you are a child, the nerve endings are still developing, so when you get soap in your eye, the nerves send a signal to the brain that something is wrong. Your brain then sends a signal back to the nerves to stop the pain. This is why it hurts so much when you get soap in your eye when you are a child. When you are an adult, the nerve endings are fully developed, so the brain doesn't send a signal", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The 9th planet is a hypothetical planet that hasn't been confirmed yet.

Companies pay the movie studio to have their products featured in the movie. The movie studio uses this money to help offset the costs of making the movie.\n\nThe amount they pay is relative to the size of the movie. The bigger the movie, the more it costs to make, and the more money the studio gets from product placement. The more products that appear in the movie, the more the studio will make.\n\nProduct placement is typically done in a way that is subtle. This helps make the movie appear more realistic,", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: The browser has a built-in ability to open a link that is provided in text. It does not have to open a new window to do this. Instead, it can open the link in the current window.\n\nThe browser uses an algorithm to determine the best way to open a link. It takes into account the speed of the network connection and the speed of the computer.\n\nThe Word application is a separate program. It has to open a new window and send the link to that window.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The reason that Cyprus is still split is because of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.\nCyprus was invaded by Turkey and the Turkish military took over a large portion of Cyprus.\nThe UN attempted to broker a peace deal between the two countries but the Turks refused and continued to occupy the northern region.\nThe Greek and Turkish Cypriots are not able to live in the same country due to the fact that they have different religions and ethnicities.\nThe two countries have not been able to come to a peace agreement so the UN is", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Archaeologists and anthropologists have studied human remains for centuries, and they have found that children are the most common type of human remains to be found. This is because children are more likely to be in a grave with their parents, and often the body of the mother is preserved due to the fact that she was likely breastfeeding. This would lead to the child being preserved as well. Children are also much easier to dig up than adults, as they are smaller and lighter.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is because during reproduction, males produce sperm and females produce eggs. Males and females are different because they have different functions. Males reproduce sperm, which contains the genetic information from the male to the offspring, while females produce eggs, which contains the genetic information from the female to the offspring. This is because the female has more genetic information to pass to the offspring than the male, because the female has a bigger body and more cells than the male. The female also has a larger reproductive organ, which is used to release eggs, and the male has a smaller reproductive", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Theoretically, the maximum data rate that can be sent through the wire is 100Mbps. Practically, this is limited by the signal quality, the transmission medium, and the device that is receiving it.\n\nThe amount of information that can be sent through the wire is limited by the bandwidth of the channel.  For example, a single copper wire can transmit 100Mbps, but a single copper wire can only support 250Mbps of bandwidth.  The other 500Mbps of bandwidth is lost to signal atten", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A human would wake up when they heard a loud noise.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I follow your question. 50% heads or tails is a statistical statement that is true for any number of coin flips.  It is independent of the outcome of previous coin flips.  If you want to know the probability of any specific outcome, you can just flip the coin and count the number of heads.\n\nIf you want to know the probability of X coin flips in a row, you can do it with a simple formula.  Let H be the probability of heads.  Let T be the probability of tails.  Then the probability", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) light gun was a peripheral device that allowed players to shoot enemies on the screen, which was a popular feature in some of the NES games.\nThe gun was based on a laser beam, which was projected onto the screen.

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: If you are involved in a car accident where someone dies, you will likely be charged with vehicular manslaughter. \n\nIf you are involved in a car accident where someone dies and you are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, you will likely be charged with vehicular manslaughter.\n\nIf you are involved in a car accident where someone dies and you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, you will likely be charged with vehicular homicide.\n\nIf you are involved in a car accident where someone dies and you are under the influence of drugs", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: One another is the plural of one another, and it means one person and another person. It comes from the Old English word for one, \u0113ac, and the Old English word for another, \u0101n. The word \u0101n is the same root word as the word another. So, it's a contraction of the word \"one and another\".", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: Plastic bolts and wing nuts are cheaper than metal bolts and wing nuts.", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: Growing up is a process that happens over a lifetime, but it's also one that you never fully stop.

If you eat something that is hard to digest, it will take longer for the liquid food to pass through the intestines, and therefore take longer to digest. This causes the food to stay in the stomach longer, and as a result, causes more pressure to build up. The pressure will then cause your body to feel the need to release the food from the stomach. When this happens, it is called \"", "\n\nHuman: How and why did Pokemon win the popularity contest against Digimon?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pokemon was originally created in 1995 and it quickly became popular in the United States.
