So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Well, I'm not a doctor, but I'll try to give you some information about sugar.  Sugar is a carbohydrate.  Carbohydrates are energy sources for the body.  When you eat sugar, it is broken down into glucose, which is then converted into energy for the body.  The sugar we eat in food is also broken down into glucose, and then is converted into energy.  Glucose is also used to make other important molecules in the body, including some hormones.  So sugar is used by the body to make", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

Reddit has a policy against asking about reddit itself, so I'm going to tell you that Reddit is a social news aggregation website. Reddit was founded in 2005 by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, two Harvard University students. It is a place for people to discover interesting content created by users. Users are able to submit content, such as text posts or direct links, known as \"links\" or \"posts\", which are then voted on by members of the site.

Anandamide is a naturally occurring chemical in the body that also causes a \u201chigh\u201d feeling, but it is not the same chemical as THC.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Because it's a chemical reaction. Water has a polar nature, so it is attracted to other polar molecules, like smells. This allows the smell to be more easily absorbed into the air.\n\nThis is a good explanation, but it's not quite right. Water molecules are polar, but water itself is not polar. It has a net zero charge, which means it is not attracted to any other charged molecules. Polar molecules are attracted to other polar molecules, and non-polar molecules are attracted to other non-polar molecules. Water is", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: The information that is sent through the internet is made up of ones and zeros.  These are digital signals and are sent over an analogue medium.  There are many different analogue and digital signals which are all transmitted using different frequencies.\n\nThe bandwidth of a cable is the maximum amount of information that can be sent over the cable.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future?

Once the embryo has developed into a fetus, you would have to find a surrogate mother.  The surrogate mother could be a human or another species that has a similar body type to humans.  She would then carry the fetus to term.  When the baby is born, it would be a Neanderthal.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I see.

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: I think it's because the way the vocal cords vibrate is different when people sing. When we talk, the vocal cords are vibrating at a very high frequency, which makes the voice sound more natural. However, when people sing, the vocal cords are vibrating at a much lower frequency, which makes the voice sound strange.", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The clouds are not made of water vapour.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are the digits that are used in the calculation of a number. For example, the number 22.35 is written as 22.35, because we have no need to use the decimal point. The number 3.45 is written as 3.45, because the decimal point is used to show that the number is being rounded. You can see that 22.35 is not the same as 22.35000000000000000000000000000", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver stores bile in the gallbladder, and once it is released into the duct, it travels to the small intestine and helps to break down fats.  The liver also produces bile, which is made of bile salts, cholesterol, and water.  The gallbladder stores bile until it is needed by the body.  The liver makes bile to help digest fats.  Bile contains bile salts, cholesterol, and water.  Bile salts help break down fats.

This is also why when you boil vegetables, they release water.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because of the water molecules.

This is why when you get out of the water, your skin is soft.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because the Moon is not as far away as objects billions of light years away.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Drinking a liquid is not dehydrating.
