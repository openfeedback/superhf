If you throw a dart at a number line, you have a chance of hitting some rational number.

While in the womb, the baby is protected by the amniotic sac, which allows the baby to float around and not directly come into contact with anything. Outside of the womb, the baby is in direct contact with the fluid and solid objects around them. In addition, the womb is full of a fluid that protects the baby from the outside world.

What made computers like the Cray so large and expensive, and have the features that they were designed to provide been shrunk and mass-produced with our technological progression?\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the explanations y'all.\n\nAssistant: The Cray was a large computer because the early computers were not able to handle the processing power necessary to perform some of the complex calculations that are required by super computers.  The Cray was also expensive because it was a very advanced piece of technology and could be used to perform very complex calculations that were not possible before its introduction.\n\nA desktop computer is not as powerful as a Cray because it is not designed to perform the same type of calculations.

The actual cost is around $65 million, with the rest of the cost being paid back to the people who invested in the movie.

The United States dollar is more stable and that makes it worth more.\n\nFor example, if the U.S. dollar is worth 1.10 euros, that means that 1 euro is worth .90 U.S. dollars. This means that the euro is worth less and that is why it", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hippy generation was able to travel the country and enjoy the lifestyle because they did not have careers, so they had more money to spend on travel.", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: That is an interesting question. Perhaps it has to do with the length of the day.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: To answer your question, I\u2019ll give you two examples of how we have been able to do this in the past. The first one is by building a better understanding of the world. To give you an example of what I mean, let\u2019s talk about self driving cars. One of the first problems to solve for self driving cars is to be able to understand what the car is seeing. This is because if we want to make a self driving car that can drive in any situation, we need to make sure that it can drive well in any situation. The first approach we took was to use a camera to make sure that the", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 1*10^99 is a very large number, it takes a lot of time to compute it.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts.

If you are not, you are not chewing your food properly.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: I don't know.\n\nEven with a very high concentration of sodium, there is a taste sensation.\n\nEven if the medication is in solution and the concentration of sodium is very high, there is a taste sensation.\n\nEven if the medication is in solution and the concentration of sodium is very high, there is a taste sensation.\n\nEven if the medication is in solution and the concentration of sodium is very high, there is a taste sensation.\n\nEven if the medication is in solution and the concentration of sodium is", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty of the position (delta x) and the uncertainty of momentum (delta p) must be greater than h/(4*pi) where h is Planck's constant. This equation means that the more accurately you know one of the quantities, the more inaccurate the other quantity will be.\n\nThe uncertainty of the position is the uncertainty of a single measurement of the position of a particle. \nThe uncertainty of the momentum is the uncertainty of a single measurement of the momentum of a particle.\n\nThe uncertainty of a single measurement is the standard", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Here\u2019s a good example:\n\nSuppose you\u2019re driving down the freeway and you hit the brakes. You\u2019ve already started slowing down, but you still hit the brakes. \n\nThis happens because the time it takes for your car to respond to your brake input and for your brakes to slow your car is called the hysteresis. \n\nSo, when you hit the brakes, the car responds, but it doesn\u2019t stop immediately. The car takes a while to stop, and when it stops, it\u2019s still going slower than it was", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't know the specifics of the AMD vs. Intel CPUs, but here are some general thoughts on the matter:\n\n > AMD is a more affordable brand that is capable of matching the performance of Intel's higher-end CPUs.\n\n > For example, a $115 AMD CPU is likely to be a 3.5GHz, 6-core CPU that is a good match for an Intel 6-core CPU that costs 2x as much.\n\n > AMD has been very competitive in the 12", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, I'm not sure exactly, but I can tell you what it's not.

The Middle East is a region where the United States has a lot of influence, and the United States is an important ally for many countries in the region, including Israel. The conflict between Israel and Palestine, and the civil wars that have been fought in Syria and Libya, are very important to the US. In the past, the US has tried to prevent these conflicts from escalating, and has tried to help the countries involved find a peaceful solution to their problems. But this is difficult to do, because the", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: The primary difference between sugar and other calorie-dense foods is that sugar has the highest glycemic index of any food.  In other words, when you eat a high-glycemic food like sugar, your body is more likely to release insulin to counteract the sugar\u2019s effects than when you eat a low-glycemic food, like vegetables or a low-carb food.  So, when you eat a lot of sugar, your body releases a lot of insulin, which can cause your blood sugar to drop too quickly and cause you to feel hungry", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

The major labels are owned by large media companies like Sony, Universal, Warner, and Apple, and have a very large marketing machine.  A major label can provide distribution, marketing, and promotion to help sell more albums.  I believe the smaller independent labels are owned by individuals or smaller companies, and do not have the same marketing power.", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: I think the way you experience time changes depending on your location in the universe is because time is relative.

There is no theoretical limit to the amount of information that can be sent through a cable internet connection.  The amount of information that can be sent is limited by the amount of bandwidth you have purchased.  Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be sent per second.

And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: I'm a native speaker of English. I've never heard of this expression. I think it's a misspelling and the correct version is \"one another\". The correct version is in common use and the incorrect version isn't.", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: In the past, we've found that some customers prefer plastic bolts and wing nuts instead of metal ones.", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m going to go through a bunch of questions first, to get a general idea of what people are thinking about before jumping in.\n\nAre you thinking about what it means to be an adult?\n\nDo you feel like you\u2019re growing up, or are you already an adult?\n\nAre you thinking about the physical changes that happen to people as they grow up?\n\nAre you thinking about emotional maturity?\n\nAre you thinking about what you\u2019re learning about life?\n\nAre you thinking about what it means to grow up, and what you\u2019re learning about yourself?", "\n\nHuman: If there's being such serious human rights violations goiing on in Qatar, and FIFA aren't doing anything about it, then how come none of the world governments or the UN are putting pressure on something to be done?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If the FIFA are being paid by the Qatar government to continue to host the World Cup, then they are complicit in the violations.", "\n\nHuman: Sure Deposit\n\nI am being told that, despite having deposit in the name, it's just an unrelated fee.

Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is the natural state of dormancy of many animals that are cold-blooded. They enter a state of inactivity and sleep that can last for days, weeks, or months. They are able to survive this because of the large amount of fat they have stored up in the months prior to hibernation. These animals usually wake up when spring comes around. They recover because of the high amount of fat in their bodies.\n\nWhile in hibernation, they are inactive and they don\u2019t eat, drink, or eliminate waste.

For example, a male who has been a smoker for 20 years is more likely to have health problems, and thus charge a higher rate.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The short answer is no. The long answer is that it is impossible to recreate a Neanderthal.\n\nNeanderthal genome sequences have been sequenced, but the genome of a Neanderthal is not sufficient to recreate a Neanderthal.  There are many missing pieces of information that are required to create a fully functional Neanderthal.\n\nThe first missing piece of information is that we do not know what the genome of a Neanderthal is like.  We know that there are a few genes that are unique to humans and Neanderthals.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender person is someone who does not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth.

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: When you sing, your larynx muscles are used to make the sound. These muscles are under your vocal cords, and they move to open and close them. When you speak, your larynx muscles are also used, but they are more relaxed. This causes a different sound, and when your voice is more relaxed, it sounds more natural.\n\nAdele's voice is very strong, so when she sings, she uses a lot of muscle to open her vocal cords. This makes her voice sound strong and deep.\n\nOther people's voices are more relax", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is not known why clouds are made of water vapour.

I believe it has to do with the surface tension of the water. The surface tension of water is an important concept in chemistry and physics. It is the force that keeps the water molecules from getting as far apart as they would like. The surface tension is what keeps a drop of water from spreading out into a pool.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The problem is that the light from those objects is so bright that it overpowers the light from the Moon, making it hard to see. The Apollo astronauts left equipment that reflects little light, so it's hard to see even when the Moon is bright.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Liquids are not absorbed through the lining of the stomach, but rather through the lining of the small intestine. This means that the liquid you drink does not hydrate you in the same way as eating solid foods does.

The second is to communicate anonymously with a journalist and provide details of the attack to them. This would be an example of a private claim.

We recommend that you leave tor windows in their original default size.\"\n\nHow exactly does that work?\n\nAssistant: The Tor Browser is a browser that helps you protect your privacy on the Internet by anonymizing your communications and hiding your real IP address. To do so, it needs to know your monitor size so that it can create a window that is the same size as your real monitor. The problem with this is that websites can use this information to track you and, in some cases, even guess your real IP address.\n\nTo avoid this, the Tor Browser can be configured to run in a limited window size that is different from your real monitor size. To do so, you can use the command \"tor browser\" in the", "\n\nHuman: How bad is the U.S.'s education really?\n\nI can't seem to find any good sources on the notion that the U.S. sucks at education?

A dryer has a drum, a heating element to heat the air and a fan to blow the air into the drum. To wash clothes, you just fill the drum with water and add clothes. The drum then spins so the water can wash the clothes. To dry clothes, you just fill the drum with air. The motor spins the drum and the heating element heats the air. The fan blows the heated air into the drum.

When the weather is good, the production of", "\n\nHuman: Why can we feel hot/sweaty, but when you touch your skin (or someone else does) the skin feels cold?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's because when you feel hot/sweaty, your skin is actually sending a signal to your brain, which then generates heat to help your body cool down. This process is called cutaneous vasoconstriction, and is a normal response to heat. When you touch your skin, the nerves in your skin send the sensation of cold to your brain. This signals your body to generate heat to warm your skin back up.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Well, I know why I do that.

(Where R of human body is same)\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's not that simple. Ampere is a measure of current. Current is the amount of charge per second which flows through the circuit. Volt is a measure of potential difference between two points in a circuit. Potential difference is defined as the work required to move one unit of charge from one point to the other. Work done by a current in a circuit is defined as the product of current and the potential difference between the two points. So, current is a measure of the amount of charge per second and the potential difference is a measure of how much work is done per unit of charge.\n\nThe current that is", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't there psychotherapists who advertise themselves as working after 5pm?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because it's very hard to find clients after 5pm, and the only people who are willing to pay for services in the evening are those who are already seeing a psychotherapist.", "\n\nHuman: What is fire??\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fire is a chemical reaction in which oxygen reacts with\nsubstances, such as wood, coal, or other fuels, to produce heat and\ngases.
