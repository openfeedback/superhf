As the sweat glands produce sweat, they are connected to a duct that runs to the armpit. A deodorant contains aluminum chloride, which is an antiperspirant, which means it stops sweat from being produced. When sweat is prevented from reaching the armpit, the human body is not able to sweat. The deodorant is applied directly to the skin, which causes the aluminum chloride to come into contact with the sweat glands. The aluminum chloride then stops the sweat from reaching the armpit.\n\nWhat is the difference between antipers", "\n\nHuman: why we can't divide by zero?\n\n\n\nAssistant: that's impossible", "\n\nHuman: How does this work?\n\nFound [this](_URL_0_) on r/Pokemon and became intensely curious as to how this works.

The Fourier Transform is a way to represent the sound signal as a series of sinusoidal waves of different frequencies.\n\nA Fourier Transform of a sound signal is called a spectrum, and the frequencies of the spectrum are the components of the Fourier Transform.

I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\". I have been to Boston before and didn't see wrong policepower. Therefore I'm asking myself where these videos are coming from and if they are true. This is not meant to be a revolutionist-topic. I just want bare facts and impressions from wiser people.\n\nExamples: _URL_1_\n(Homeless guy killed)\n\n_URL_0_\n(Guy killed after he tried to prevent wife and daughter from fighting)\n\n... countless others...\n\nAssistant: We can't give you any more information, we can't comment on that.

Why do we gag when we put our finger in our throat?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That's the point. We don't gag when we put our finger in our throat because we're not doing it consciously. It's not like we think, \"I'm going to put my finger in my throat to make a noise. I'm going to make a noise.\" But we do it unconsciously.", "\n\nHuman: What is happening when our nipples get hard?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It means you are becoming aroused.", "\n\nHuman: Why haven't we been able to find out where Blue Whales mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, we haven't been able to find a way to measure them in the ocean.", "\n\nHuman: What is the point of Kirchhoff's First Law?\n\nMy exam starts in 3 hours so this is late but what the hell.\n\nIf Kirchhoff's first law says the current going into a junction is equal to the current coming out of a junction isn't that basically saying that I=I? I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: What are you talking about?", "\n\nHuman: Why does rain look stationary from a distance?\n\nWhen looking at a thunderstorm from far away you can see the rain coming down to the ground but it just looks as if the cloud is extended in sheets towards the earth. Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: The short answer is that the cloud is rotating. The cloud is rotating and you are rotating with it. As you are looking down at the cloud from far away the cloud appears stationary. You are not rotating with the cloud.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers!

Wouldn\u2019t video be more valuable for the NTSB in case something bad happens?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, that\u2019s a very good question. Let me go back and try to explain the difference. With the audio recorder, we record the cockpit audio, but we don\u2019t record the flight data recorder, which is the recorder for the flight data. That\u2019s a black box recorder. That is the recorder for the plane. The audio recorder is just for the cockpit, which is the cockpit voice recorder.\n\nI think the audio recorder is the main recorder we use. I know in the past, they\u2019ve used video. They used video to look for black boxes, but that\u2019s not something we use.", "\n\nHuman: Radioactivity.

This made them vulnerable to the possibility of bank runs. To avoid this, the Federal Reserve made it possible for banks to create their own money. This was done by making it possible for banks to lend their money to one another. Banks can lend money to one another by creating new electronic money out of nothing. This is done by a bank's computer system.", "\n\nHuman: Why are there diseases/viruses/etc that harm the human body, but never anything that enhances or improves us?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In order to keep the human body in a constant state of stress, we have to take advantage of the weaknesses of our bodies.", "\n\nHuman: Why is a cup the prize the team/individual gets when they win something instead of the subject related item.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: How do I get a screenshot of my computer screen?", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s called the \u201cdepth of field triangle\u201d.

I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: Can you change the temperature of a subject with sound alone?", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because you're trying to fix something that's not broken.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we drool when we sleep? More specifically during daytime naps...\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's a reflex. When we're awake, our brain has the urge to keep our tongue moistened for a few hours, and when we sleep, it can't do that. So it goes into a reflex to keep our tongues moist.", "\n\nHuman: What's the purpose of the mysterious slash at the end of URLs?\n\nExample 1: type \"reddit\" in Google. Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: What's the purpose of the mysterious slash at the end of URLs?", "\n\nHuman: Why does the US have to be close allies with Saudi Arabia?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Why do we have to be close allies with Saudi Arabia?", "\n\nHuman: How is Hacking possible.\n\nThis is a really hard concept for me so please bear with me.

Can't they just stop choking themselves when it gets sketchy? And once they pass out, doesn't the body automatically breathe for them/if applicable their partner would stop choking them?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry to say this, but that's not how it works.", "\n\nHuman: The movement of long string-like things through the air/water\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The movement of long string-like things through the air/water", "\n\nHuman: How did humanity get this far with only recently having clean, filtered water to drink from?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: What is athletes foot and why does it hurt?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Athletes foot is an infection of the foot caused by a fungus called tinea pedis.
