The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: The archaeologist's answer is: \"Because children are easier to find and preserve than adults. Children's bodies are small and fragile and are usually not buried deep. They are more likely to be found by scavengers, which makes it easier to recover them. They are also less likely to be buried in cemeteries, and they are often found in places where they died, such as rivers or lakes, where they are easily preserved.\"", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I am sorry, but we do not have any information about the question you asked.

We do not think that \"one another\" is grammatical, but it is the preferred term in the United States.

It is made up of protein and nucleic acid. It can only replicate itself by attaching to a cell, and then it uses the cell's machinery to make more copies of itself. The cell has a self-destruct mechanism which kills the cell when it is full of viruses. The virus can only survive if it is inside a cell. When the cell is destroyed, the virus dies too. So, the virus can only infect a healthy cell. If the virus enters an already sick cell, it can not multiply because the cell is already", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason for that is that the body is in a state of 'suspended animation', which is a state of low energy, low metabolism and low activity, and it is in this state that it sleeps. The body has a number of mechanisms that prevent it from entering a state of hibernation, such as a temperature regulation mechanism, a food-intake regulation mechanism, a respiration regulation mechanism, and a sleep-wake regulation mechanism.
