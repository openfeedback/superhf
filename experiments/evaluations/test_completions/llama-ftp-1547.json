The most common cause is that the person's immune system fights off the virus.  This is why it's possible for some people to recover from Ebola and then go on to develop antibodies against it, which can be used to treat other people who are infected.\n\nAnother reason that some people may recover from Ebola is that they have a natural immunity to the virus.

The paradox arises from the fact that if the set of all sets that are not members of themselves is a member of itself, then the set of all sets that are not members of themselves is a member of itself, and so on. The paradox illustrates the limitations of naive set theory, and the need for a more complex theory such as Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing?

What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: There are many things that make water blue or green. The main thing that makes water blue is that the water is full of tiny particles that scatter light. It is also known as Rayleigh scattering. \n\nWhen light hits a solid object, the light bounces off of it. But when light hits a liquid, the light bounces off the particles in the liquid. \n\nThe water\u2019s color depends on how big the particles are. Water with bigger particles reflects more light, so the water appears lighter. Water with smaller particles reflects less light, so the water appears darker.", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES zapper is a plastic gun that is designed to be used with the NES console.

Let me give you a quick overview. 32-bit systems use 32-bit integers for calculations. 64-bit systems use 64-bit integers for calculations. Why? Because you need a larger number to store more information. 32-bit systems can only store 4 billion integers. 64-bit systems can store 18 quintillion integers (a quintillion is 10^18). That is a lot more information! 128-bit systems would be able to store 10", "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's not unfreezing applications, it's restarting them.", "\n\nHuman: How will new gun laws prevent mass shootings?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The government is looking for ways to prevent mass shootings.

If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: The purpose of those signs is to prevent accidents, and save lives.\n\nThere are a few things that contribute to this problem. First, it's hard to judge the size of something when you are looking at it from a distance. \n\nAnother thing is that many people don't realize how big their vehicle is. For example, a car is typically 4 feet high. \n\nHowever, a big-rig or a tractor-trailer is typically 12 feet high. \n\nThese signs are meant to prevent accidents by letting people know how high the", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly.

However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons for this. The first is that more educated people tend to be more liberal, in general. This is because the higher education you get, the more you see the world as a complex system, and the less you see people as inherently good or bad, and the more you see that people are shaped by their environment, and that some environments are better for people than others.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing.

Since clouds are usually made of water vapor, this water vapor will take up the shape of the cloud in the air, and will be blown along with the wind.  The wind can be thought of as a form of pressure which pushes the clouds and air in a particular direction.  The temperature and moisture in the air will also affect the shape of the clouds.  The amount of water vapor in the air is determined by the temperature of the air, as warmer air holds more water v", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer?

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver is the major organ in the body for the storage of fats. It also produces bile. Bile is used to break down fats during digestion. Bile is made by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. When it is needed it is released into the duodenum, where it helps break down fats from your diet. This is called emulsification. The pancreas produces digestive enzymes to break down food into usable nutrients.", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: Turning on an old TV can create an interference noise that is similar to a tone.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries are electric cells that store electrical energy. A battery produces electricity when the chemical reaction between the anode and cathode is complete. \n\nAs the chemical reaction takes place, the electrons are released from the anode to the cathode. The electrons in the cathode are then transferred to the external circuit. In the external circuit, the electrons travel through the wires and reach the device that needs the energy.\n\nIn order to keep the chemical reaction going, the battery needs to be charged. If the battery is not connected to the external circuit, the chemical reaction stops.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

It could be because they are smaller, or because they are just really cute and people want to take them home. They could also be just really cute.", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet is a technology that allows you to pass power and data over the same cable.", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's believed that it's due to the fact that the human eye has three different cone receptors, which are sensitive to red, green and blue light.", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If you mean underdeveloped countries, they are underdeveloped because of poor infrastructure, lack of education, lack of political stability, and a lack of a strong economy.", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: There are multiple reasons for this.\n\n1) Some computers are connected to the Internet because they must be. If you're going to have Internet access, you need a computer that is connected to the Internet. \n\n2) Some computers are connected to the Internet because they have to be in order to provide services to the public. For example, a library computer is connected to the Internet so that people can use it to access the Internet. \n\n3) Some computers are connected to the Internet because that is the only way for them to communicate with other computers.
