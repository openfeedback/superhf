The same way it can detect pain, it can detect other things, such as itchiness, tightness, cold, heat, etc. Once the brain detects something, it sends the information to your spinal cord, where a network of nerves is located. These nerves send the information to the other parts of the body, such as the skin, where itchiness is located. Then, it can be detected by the brain again, and the same process can happen again. This is called the sensory feedback loop.", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D?

How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: It's hard to say with certainty, but I can imagine a few different reasons. The taste of saline solution is probably not a taste you would recognize. It's not uncommon for people to describe a salty taste, but it's not the same as the saltiness of table salt. It could be the presence of medications that you're tasting. The medications themselves are not likely to taste like anything. If the medications are in solution, then they are probably not tasting like anything. However, if the medications are in a powder form and dissolving, then", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that for a particle, the more precisely the position is measured, the less precisely the momentum can be known.\n\nThis means that in order to know the position of a particle, you must have a large uncertainty in its momentum. Conversely, in order to know the momentum of a particle, you must have a large uncertainty in its position.\n\nThe uncertainty in position is \n\ndelta x  = \n\nh / (4*pi)\n\nThe uncertainty in momentum is \n\ndelta p = \n\nh / (4*", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a term that is used in physics and other fields to describe the phenomenon of how a system may be impacted by its history.  For example, the temperature of a room may have a certain hysteresis because the room has a history of being heated in the past.  It is important to remember that hysteresis does not mean that the system is stuck in the past.  It simply means that the system has a history and the system\u2019s history is important.  For example, the temperature of a room may be impacted by its history but it is not stuck in the", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

Instead, you should try to get more sleep, which will help you feel less tired and will help your body to recover.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The AMD CPUs are more power-efficient than Intel CPUs, so they have to use more cores to match the performance of the Intel ones. For example, the 6-core AMD CPU is actually a 12-core CPU that is power-efficient enough to allow a 6-core version to run at the same speed as a 6-core Intel CPU. Intel CPUs are not power-efficient enough to allow 8-core and 12-core versions to run at the same speed as the 6-core and 8-core versions, respectively.\n\nSo in general", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many possible reasons for why our face twitches when we are tired. It could be due to stress, muscle strain, fatigue, or even some sort of neurological issue. It's also possible that the twitching is a side effect of some sort of medication you are taking. While the twitching could be a sign of something serious, it's unlikely that it is. Many people experience this type of twitching when they're tired or stressed.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: 1.\tBacteria and mold can grow in wet environments. This increases the amount of volatile compounds being released by the smell of the thing.\n2.\tWater makes up a large part of the mass of a thing, so when it gets wet, it takes up more volume. This can make the smell more potent, too.\n3.\tWater can also make smell more volatile. In other words, it can make the molecules that make up the smell more likely to evaporate into the air.\n4.\tWhen a thing is wet,", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: I'm glad you asked about this. Time is a very strange concept to explain, but we'll do our best. The first thing to understand is that time is not actually a physical thing. Time is a measurement, much like a ruler is a measurement. The difference between time and a ruler is that time can't be measured directly, but must be measured relative to something else. So, for example, you could measure the length of a piece of string by comparing it to the length of a ruler.
