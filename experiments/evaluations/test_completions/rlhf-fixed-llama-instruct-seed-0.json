Pain is a sign that something is wrong. The nervous system is designed to be able to sense what is happening in the body and send this information to the brain for processing. The brain then interprets this information to determine whether or not the body needs to take action to protect itself. Pain is one of the ways the nervous system tells the brain that something is wrong. If a person did not feel any pain when they touched something hot, they would burn their fingers.

Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers get better over time because of the evolution of Moore's law. Moore's law is a theory that states that the number of transistors on a chip will double every 18 months. This means that we can fit more and more information on a chip as time goes by. This is why we are able to fit more memory in flash drives and iphones. The technology has evolved and gotten better.", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 1*10^99 is a very large number, so it is not a", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: 1. Chewing helps the digestion of food by breaking it down into small pieces, and by stimulating the production of saliva. This helps to begin the digestion of carbohydrates in your mouth. The act of chewing also helps to break down food into a form that your body can absorb more easily. 2. Chewing also helps to prevent gas from forming in your digestive tract. This is because the more you chew, the more you mix air into your food, and the less chance there is for air to be trapped in your food. 3. Eating", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: The IV is a tube that is inserted into a vein to deliver a liquid (usually a drug) into your body. The liquid is called the \"IV solution.\" There are many different IV solutions. Some are just water and some are very complex solutions with medications, electrolytes, and nutrients. When the solution is pushed through the IV, it is called an \"infusion.\" IV solutions are usually clear, but may have a slight yellow color.\n\nMost IV solutions taste a little bitter and some have a slight metallic taste. The bitter taste is from the small amount of salic", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same time. It is often stated as the equation delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi). This equation can be rearranged to state that the more certain you are of the position of a particle, the less certain you are of its momentum. For example, if you know the position of a particle to within a diameter of a proton, you can never know its momentum to within a proton's diameter. The uncertainty in the position of a particle is inversely", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: It can be explained in the following way. Hysteresis is a property of a system that depends on the past.\n\nIt is a phenomenon that is found in a lot of systems.\n\nWhen you apply a force to a system, the system will try to resist that force.\n\nFor example, if you try to push a ball, it will try to resist the force you apply.\n\nIf you apply a force to a system for a long time, the system will get used to it.\n\nIf you stop applying the force, the system will stop resisting it.\n\nHowever,", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

Why?\n\nAssistant: The Chinese cuisine has a great diversity and richness. The same dish may have different tastes and flavors. This is because every region has different ingredients, different cooking styles and methods. Also, the same dish is prepared using different cooking methods.  For example, stir-frying is very popular in Chinese cuisine.  This is because it is easy to make and has a quick cooking time. This method also requires high temperatures, which make the food crispy.  The same dish may be prepared in a different way using different ing", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The eyelid is a muscle that is controlled by the brain.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Wetness and odor are not correlated. Wetness is measured by the surface area of the object being measured. For example, a cup of water has a surface area of 100 cm2, while a cup of water with a piece of dry sponge in it has a surface area of 200 cm2. The amount of water in the cup has not changed, but the surface area has, therefore the amount of liquid has increased. The same is true for odor, the more surface area in contact with the air, the more odor molecules are released.\n\nSm", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The reason you might age faster or slower is because of a couple of things. First, your location in the galaxy. Your location affects how much radiation you are exposed to, which in turn affects your biological age. If you are near a star, you are exposed to a lot of radiation. This radiation damages your cells and causes them to age faster.\n\nSecond, your location in the galaxy affects how much gravity you are exposed to. Gravity is a force that affects all objects, including you, and causes you to age. Gravity makes you age faster.\n\nWhen you return", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 1.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: I've found some research that may help you understand why. \n\nOne theory is that the remains of children were preserved better than those of adults because they were smaller and had less muscle mass and bone density. \n\nAnother theory is that ancient humans who died at a young age were often buried and preserved in special ceremonies and rituals. This may have been because they were seen as being special and having a connection to the spirit world. \n\nThe third theory is that children were often kept underground. This was to protect them from being attacked by other animals, or because they were", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: The reason why a coin flip is independent of what happened before is that the probability of getting a heads on the next flip is the same as the probability of getting a heads on the first flip.\n\nFor example, if there was a 50% chance of getting a heads on the first flip, then there is also a 50% chance of getting a heads on the second flip.\n\nIf the coin flip is 50% heads, then there is a 50% chance that the coin flip is a heads and a 50% chance that the coin f", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun is a light gun that connects to the NES console and the NES light gun was used to play light gun games such as Duck Hunt.

Broadband Internet speeds are measured in megabits per second (Mbps) or gigabits per second (Gbps). If you are downloading files, such as videos, you will want a high-speed connection, like 100 Mbps. If you are uploading files, such as photos, you will want a high-speed connection, like 10 Mbps.

This is why there are so many allegations of human rights violations, as they have always been able to hide behind their money and power. However, it is true that there is a lot of money involved in FIFA, so it is hard for the governments and the UN to get involved. They do not want to lose out on the money.

This is a natural response to the effects of drugs. The pupils of the eye are dilated when a person is on drugs as the pupils are dilated when a person is under the influence of light. The pupils of the eyes react to light by getting smaller or dilating, and to darkness by getting bigger or dilating.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Neanderthals and modern humans are closely related, but the two species have been separated for many thousands of years. Neanderthals have been extinct for thousands of years.  However, scientists have sequenced the entire genome of the Neanderthals.  This means they know all of the genes that the Neanderthals had.  There are some genes that are different between the two species, but most of the genes are the same.  We can therefore say that a modern human and a Neanderthal are very similar.  We know that the genes that are different between", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender is someone who is assigned a gender at birth that does not match their gender identity.

This is due to the fact that the shrimp is cooked at a lower temperature, which does not allow the color to develop as quickly as it does when cooking red meat. The heat from the shrimp causes the meat to release a pigment called myoglobin, which turns brown when it is cooked. The shrimp does not have this pigment, so it turns orange, rather than brown, when cooked.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure what you mean by \"it shows error\" but when you divide something by zero, the calculator will display an error.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Eating fast food is a part of the American culture.

The first is the increased use of money in politics. The second is the rise of social media. Money is used to create campaign ads that are designed to appeal to the partisan base of a party. These ads are designed to elicit a negative emotional response from the opposing party.

So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: That's a good question!\n\nThe point of the sign is to let you know if the road you are driving on is going to have an overpass that is too low for your vehicle. The sign is designed to give you enough time to make an adjustment before you hit the overpass. The sign is usually posted at the start of a low overpass, and if you see a sign that says \"Low Bridge Ahead\", it's because there is an overpass ahead that is 16 feet or less in height.\n\nThe sign will also let you know if you are driving a vehicle that", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly.

This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: Noise is caused by vibrations that are inaudible to the human ear.  Some noise is created by the wind, but other noise is created by the ground, which is called \"ground vibration\" or \"earthquake noise\".  As the ground gets colder, it becomes less flexible and the vibrations are louder.  This is why the trains are louder in the winter.", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: It's a causal question. In other words, why do people who are liberal, democrat, or left-wing tend to have higher education (college and beyond)?\n\nThere are many possible explanations. One is that higher education tends to produce people who are more liberal and tend to lean to the left. But it could also be that people who are more liberal and lean to the left are more likely to have higher education (college and beyond).\n\nThe correlation between higher education and liberalism or left-leaning has also been documented in other countries.

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: When someone sings, the voice is pushed through the larynx and then through the vocal cords, which are placed in the larynx. The vocal cords vibrate and produce the sound that we hear. The larynx is a muscular structure in the throat that is formed by the two cartilages that are joined to each other. The larynx is divided into three parts, the glottis, the epiglottis and the trachea. The glottis is the part that separates the larynx from the trachea and the epiglottis", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Clouds are made of liquid water droplets, ice crystals, or a mixture of both. These droplets or crystals are suspended in the air and are kept aloft by the wind. The wind is often strongest at the top of the clouds, and as the wind blows the clouds move. This causes the clouds to take on the shape of the wind direction, which is why the clouds are shaped the way they are. Sometimes the wind is strong enough to actually move the clouds, and this is called a tornado.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is not that smaller animals live shorter lives than larger animals. It is just that the lifespan of animals is not measured in years but in number of births. For example, a mouse may live for 2 years, but it may also give birth to 10 mice in the first year and 10 in the second year, so its total lifespan is 10+10=20 years. On the other hand, a whale may live for 100 years but it may only have one birth. So the lifespan of a whale is only 10", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Mom and Dad are the names we give to our parents when we are kids. \"Mom\" is short for \"mother\" and \"Dad\" is short for \"father.\" Over time, \"Mom\" and \"Dad\" became the names we call our parents.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Your liver is a very important part of your body. It helps remove toxins from your body and produces bile to break down fats in your food. When you eat fatty foods, your liver releases bile to break down the fats. After you eat, your gallbladder stores bile until you eat again. When you eat, your liver releases bile to help break down the fats in the food you eat. This is how your fats get broken down without a gallbladder.\n\nThe bile that is released by your liver is stored in your gall", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV is called \"television interference\".

Each cell contains a chemical that is used to generate a current. When the current is generated, it flows out of the battery and through the device. This current flows back to the battery to be used again, but over time, the chemicals in the battery lose their ability to generate current. This causes the battery to run out of power.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: Spinning in circles is a common behavior among young children, and there are a number of reasons why they may enjoy this activity. One possible explanation is that spinning in circles helps them to develop motor skills. Another possibility is that they enjoy the feeling of being in a state of suspension.\n\nSpinning in circles can also be a way for children to release energy and have fun. Children who spin in circles may do so in a variety of different situations, including when they are playing on a playground, when they are at a party, or when they are in a classroom.", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Big Bang is an explanation of how the universe started.

A lot of the time, we like to be able to see ourselves in a cute animal. For example, when a baby giraffe is cute, we see a little version of ourselves in that animal. 2. We like to see animals in their natural habitat, even if it\u2019s dangerous. For example, a lion cub that is playing with a dog is adorable. 3. Most people don\u2019t see animals as just a dangerous animal. They see a cute animal that can be tamed and used for many different purposes. 4.

First, these countries have\na much larger population than most of the more developed countries.\nThe world's poorest countries have an average population density of 250 people per square kilometer, while the world's most populous countries have an average density of 150 people per square kilometer.\nIn other words, there are 4 times as many people in the poorest countries as in the most populous countries.

Some of these systems are old and have never been connected to the internet, while some of the systems are newer and are connected to the internet. The main reason for this is that the government is a very large organization and it is not possible to connect all of the systems to a single network.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nVegetables are made up of water, which is why they can release their water when you add salt to them.

Drinking a liquid that does not contain water will dehydrate you because you are drinking water without replacing it. For example, coffee contains no water, but it does contain caffeine, which is a water-soluble substance. Drinking coffee will not replace the water you have lost, and you will become dehydrated. You can also become dehydrated by drinking alcohol. The body needs water to function properly. Dehydration can cause dizziness, nausea, and", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hispanic refers to people from the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America.

We recommend that you leave tor windows in their original default size.\"\n\nHow exactly does that work?\n\nAssistant: It is possible that some websites try to determine the size of the screen of the computer that is used to browse the site. The most common method to determine the screen size is to use a script that detects the size of the screen.\n\nFor example, the size of the screen can be detected using the window width, height, or screen width, height. If you use the size of the window as the size of the screen, the size of the window depends on the screen size. If the size of the window is set to a large size, the size of the window is larger than the size of the screen.", "\n\nHuman: How bad is the U.S.'s education really?\n\nI can't seem to find any good sources on the notion that the U.S. sucks at education? Personally I'm interested in instead of full nation vs full nation how to subpopulations compare to each other? i.e. poor Americans vs poor Chinese, rich americans vs rich Chinese. Anyone familiar with this area?\n\nAssistant: 1. Education in the United States is the responsibility of individual states, and the United States has no national education system. There is a huge variation in the quality of education across the United States, and the quality of education in different states is also very different. 2. The United States has some of the best universities in the world, but most Americans attend community colleges or public universities. 3. The United States has a huge number of private schools, and the quality of education at these schools is very different. 4. In the United States, education is very expensive, and many families cannot afford to send", "\n\nHuman: Why does it take two separate machines to wash and dry clothes? Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer is actually a bit more complex than you may think. The reason why two machines are needed is because of the way that machines work. Washing machines spin in a clockwise direction, while dryers spin in a counterclockwise direction. The reason for this is that the two spins cancel each other out, so that the washing machine doesn't tip over. However, if both werehes and dries were made to spin in the same direction, they would spin at the same speed and the machine would tip over. To avoid this, both washing and drying machines have to be made to spin in", "\n\nHuman: From crack to current, what is the story behind Toronto mayor Rob Ford?\n\nWhat has Toronto mayor Rob Ford been accused of doing?

Fire needs a spark, such as a match, to start, and it needs oxygen to keep going. It can also be produced by friction.\n\nWhen a substance is burned, it changes from a solid to a gas, which is called combustion. The gases produced by burning are called smoke.

First, Chinese and Mexican food often contain high amounts of fat and calories. When we eat something like this, our bodies digest it and turn it into energy to help us move and exercise. This means that our body doesn't have to use energy to digest the food. This helps us feel fuller, and we end up eating less. But since the body doesn't need to use energy to digest the food, it's able to use the energy it gets from the food to do things like digestion and heal. The second reason for this is that", "\n\nHuman: How and why did Pokemon win the popularity contest against Digimon?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Digimon was first released in 1997 as an anime series.

So, the equation can be written as a^2 + b^2 = c^2. When we subtract 6b from both sides of the equation, we get 4a - 6b = 0. We can solve this equation by multiplying both sides by 2. We get 2a - 12b = 0. So, we get that a = 6 and b = -4. Therefore, a^2 = 6^2 = 36 and b^2 = -4^2 = -1", "\n\nHuman: Compare two items using comparisons of likeness and difference.\nInput: [1, 2] and [2, 3]\n\nAssistant: 1 and 2 are both items. 2 and 3 are both items.", "\n\nHuman: Which harry potter character would be best at programming? why?\n\nAssistant: Harry would be the best.
