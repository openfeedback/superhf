What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are used to determine the accuracy of a calculation or measurement. A significant digit is the digit to the right of the decimal point in a number. For example, if you are calculating the area of a rectangle that is 50 feet by 40 feet, you would use 2 significant digits to determine the area. The first significant digit is the 5, because it is to the right of the decimal point. The second significant digit is the 0, because it is the last digit. 50.0000000000000000000", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer.

PoE makes it easier and less expensive to install and maintain network", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Colour vision is the ability to see colours, or to perceive colour differences. In humans, colour vision is encoded in the retina by three types of cone cells, each of which is sensitive to a different range of colours. Each of the three types of cones, referred to as red, green, and blue (RGB) cones, responds best to a particular wavelength of light, and the brain uses this information to interpret the colour of an object. Colour vision is an example of a special case of trichromacy, the ability to see at least three different colours. Colour vision is more", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Third world countries are often underdeveloped because of the lack of education, infrastructure, and resources. In many cases, these countries are unable to provide a good education for their citizens, and therefore the population is unskilled and unable to find jobs. Many countries also have limited access to resources such as clean water and electricity. This causes many diseases such as malaria and cholera, which can be fatal if not treated properly.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Water is released from vegetables when they are cut because the cells of the vegetable are broken. The cells of the vegetable are made of a lot of water and when you cut them, the cells break and the water leaks out. The amount of water that is released depends on how much the vegetable is cut and how much salt is added. The more you cut the vegetable and the more salt you add, the more water will be released.\n\nThanks!", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Wrinkly hands are a result of the water tightening the skin's collagen and elastin fibers.
