They increase", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens when you pull your back? I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you pull your back, you are actually stretching your lower back, which can be a good thing, but it can also be bad. If you stretch too much, you can tear a muscle or ligament, and cause a bad back injury. But if you stretch just a little bit, your back muscles will stay strong, and you won't have to worry about a bad back injury. If you are doing something, and you feel pain in your lower back, stop and stretch it out. If it hurts, you are stretching it too much. If you have to stretch it a lot, you", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: Currency is worth more when the country's economy is doing well.

The hippy lifestyle was their career, so they made enough money to live off of their passions. The hippies were able to work part time while traveling, so they were able to find enough jobs to live off of. Hippies were also able to find money from grants, scholarships, and their parents to fund their trips.\n\nHippies were also able to find money from grants, scholarships, and their parents to fund their trips.\n\nHippies were also able to", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: Let me explain how sleep is related to the rotation of the earth. When you sleep, your brain releases chemicals that help your body and mind feel refreshed and ready to go. \n\nYour body\u2019s circadian rhythm is controlled by a group of cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus of your brain. When you sleep, the SCN tells your body to release chemicals that make you feel tired. When you\u2019re awake, the SCN tells your body to release chemicals that make you feel alert.\n\nYour body\u2019s", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The answer to your question is that Moore\u2019s Law applies to computers. Moore\u2019s Law states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years. This is due to the exponential growth in computer hardware, which makes computers faster, more powerful, and more energy-efficient.", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because 10^99 is not a power of 10, but 10^99 is a power of 100.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow.

Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The equation is saying that if you measure the momentum of an object, you will not be able to measure the position with the same accuracy.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is the property of a system or device that resists change when that change is applied. It is the opposite of a system that responds quickly to change.\n\nHysteresis can be caused by several different factors.\n\nFor example, a system can have hysteresis because it is physically slow to respond to a change in the system. This is often the case with a system that is not very responsive.\n\nAnother cause of hysteresis is a system that has a small range of sensitivity to a change in the system. This is often the case with a", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: I think the answer is that the United States is a nation of immigrants, while Europe is a nation of nations.  A nation of nations is more likely to be accepting of new cultures and ideas.  In the United States, we have a long history of immigration and we are proud of our traditions, so we tend to be more conservative.  I'm not saying this is bad, it's just how it is.  I think you'll find that many Europeans are more liberal than Americans because they are more accepting of new ideas and cultures.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This is a reflexive action that helps to keep our eyes healthy. The rubbing action helps to remove any irritants such as dust, pollen, and other particles that can collect on the eye's surface. This also helps to prevent any irritation and discomfort.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: AMD's 6-core CPUs are cheaper because they are not as good as Intel's 6-core CPUs.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Many parts of our face muscles are involved in moving our eyes, and when we're tired, these muscles can get tired too.

I think that the West needs to continue to arm countries in the Middle East to ensure that there is not a nuclear arms race. I think that the US needs to have a strong presence in the Middle East to ensure that there is not a major terrorist attack. I think that countries in the Middle East should be allowed to decide their own fate without outside intervention. I think that the US should focus on its own domestic issues. I think that the US should focus on building up its military to defend itself and prevent a terrorist attack", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: The biggest concern about sugar is its effect on blood sugar levels.  This is because a significant amount of our energy comes from sugar in our blood.\n\nWhen we eat sugar, our blood sugar levels go up, which is a good thing.  However, if we eat too much sugar, our blood sugar levels get too high.  This is a problem because when our blood sugar levels are too high, our bodies start to store the excess sugar as fat.\n\nIt is the effect on blood sugar levels that is harmful, not the calories.  You could eat a lot of sugar and still be in a cal", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

Reddit only displays the first 500 upvotes in a post's comments section. The system also has a limit of 10,000 upvotes on a post. This means that the highest you can ever upvote a post is 10,000 upvotes. Since the system only shows 500 of the first 10,000 upvotes, the maximum number of upvotes on a post is 4,000. The system also has a limit", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If two pieces of the hardest material were to try to break through one another, they would be unable to break through each other.

This is caused by the inability of the molecules in the liquid to move against each other. As the molecules in the fluid move, they push and pull on each other. This is what causes fluid to flow, because it is able to move the molecules past each other. This resistance is caused by the internal friction. This internal friction is what causes viscosity, the resistance of a fluid to flow. A fluid will be more viscous as it becomes more stiff. Vis", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing.

When the camera is in the mirror, it appears in the reflection. So, the director must use a second camera to record the scene from the side. This second camera is the one that is reflected in the mirror. The actor's face is then cut out from the scene with the second camera, and placed on the scene with the first camera. The actor's face is then reflected in the mirror. Voila, you have a \"reflex\" shot!", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the United States, circumcision is a common practice that is often performed on males in their early years of life. Circumcision is often considered to be a religious ritual or a way to reduce the chances of contracting certain diseases. There are also studies that suggest circumcision can reduce the risk of penile cancer and urinary tract infections. Circumcision is a procedure that involves the removal of the foreskin on the penis. Circumcision is often performed on infants because it is believed to be less painful and less invasive when the baby is younger.", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: If we consider the board as a state, then Go has a finite number of states, because each player can take one move at a time. In Chess, however, each player can take an unlimited number of moves at a time, so the number of states is infinite.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: I don't know,  but I'd guess that it's just because the restaurant uses stuff that's better than what you'd find at the grocery store.  I'm not sure, though.  Maybe it's just because restaurants have better chefs.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you try to look at something far away, the image is\nusually out of focus and blurry. This blurred image is actually a\nseries of slightly blurred images that are stacked together\nbecause of the way the image is focused in the eye. This creates a\nblurred image that is still slightly focused. This is known as\ndiffraction. When the image is out of focus, the image looks\nblurry because the blurred image is out of focus. This is called\ndiffraction blur.\n\nThe eye is actually a lens, and this l", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is made by dissolving\ncarbon dioxide under high pressure into water.\nThe water is then allowed to release this pressure\nand the carbon dioxide is released as a gas.\nThis process is called \"carbonation\".\nThe water is then filtered and bottled.\n\nCarbonated water is also known as \"sparkling water\"\nbecause the carbonation creates a small amount of carbonation.\nIt is also known as \"mineral water\" because it is water\nwith dissolved minerals.\n\nCarbonated water is also known as \"selt", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb. Americans do not pronounce the letter H in words that begin with an H, such as herb. However, herb is not an American word, so it is not affected by this rule. Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb. The American spelling of colour is color, but the British spelling is colour. Americans also spell the word \"labour\" with a", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer is that it is actually the temperature of the water that does not change much, but the water flow that changes. In fact, the water temperature does not change much, because the temperature of the water is affected by the water pressure and the flow rate. So the temperature of the water is actually a function of the water pressure and the water flow rate. However, the water temperature of the shower does not change much because the temperature of the water is only a small part of the total heat energy of the shower. Since the water temperature is a small part of the total energy, the temperature does not change much.

The languages in question must have similar roots, and the meaning of words must remain consistent. For example, the modern word for \"father\" in English is \"father\" in Latin, but in Latin, \"pater\" means \"father\" and \"paterfamilias\" means \"father of the family\" which is a title. So the translation for \"father\" in Latin is \"pater\" in Latin and \"pater\" in English. The same is true of Greek and Latin, and many other languages. Since English is a Germanic", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The way you experience time is different depending on your location in the universe because of the way space and time are related. The concept of time is something that is important to understand when considering the universe as a whole.\n\nImagine you are standing on a planet in the universe. This planet is very close to a star and you can see the star in the sky. The star is constantly giving off energy, so as you stand on the planet, you are constantly being warmed by the energy from the star. You are also surrounded by a thin layer of gas, which is called the atmosphere.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology is the official authority for defining the meter. The meter was originally defined as the distance between the North and South poles of Earth. However, the Earth\u2019s axis has shifted over time and the length of the meter has changed. To keep the meter constant, the length of the International Bazaar was redefined to be the meter. The International Bazaar was chosen because it is a building that is open to the public. This way anyone can", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is due to two factors: 1.

Your body is able to better regulate hormones, which helps it better handle the pain.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The 9th planet was first hypothesized in 2018, but it has not been confirmed. The reason for this is that the planet is very far away, which makes it difficult to detect. In fact, it is so far away that it would require a telescope with a diameter of 100 meters to see it.\n\nAnother reason is that the planet is believed to be small, and may even be smaller than the Earth.\n\nThe last reason is that the planet is believed to be made of rock, and may even be covered by an atmosphere of rock. \n\nIt", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Cannibalism is a behavior that can be found in a number of species. It may be a way of obtaining nutrients, a way of regulating population size, or a way of eliminating competition. In some cases, cannibalism can be beneficial. For example, some species of fish that are born at the bottom of the ocean need to consume other organisms in order to obtain sufficient oxygen for survival. When cannibalism occurs among spiders, it is usually a response to environmental stress. A newly-mated female black widow may eat her mate because she", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: The most common way for a product to be included in a movie is by a paid product placement. In this case, the product's company pays a specific amount for each product placement. The amount of the payment depends on how long the product is visible in the movie, the number of times it's visible, and the duration of the scene. There's a lot of factors that affect the price. The product's company also decides how subtle or obvious the product placement is. Sometimes it's a paid product placement and other times it's a paid product inclusion.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: I believe it is because of the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus which led to a UN embargo and the country being effectively cut off from the rest of the world.

In the case of humans, reproduction is sexual. In the case of lions, reproduction is by copulation. In both cases, the female is responsible for the production of the offspring. In sexual reproduction, the male is responsible for the delivery of the sperm, while in the case of lions, the male is responsible for the delivery of the sperm. In both cases, the female is responsible for the delivery of the egg, which is the cell that will develop into an offspring.", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Yes, there is a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet.

I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: this is a trend because of cultural reasons, mostly. I am not sure about this, but I believe that some anime and manga are set in a world where people can age at a much slower rate than in real life. It is a way to make it possible for people to experience life in a way that is similar to real life.

During hibernation, an animal's metabolic rate is reduced, heart rate decreases, and body temperature drops. Hibernation allows an animal to survive without food for long periods of time, and in some cases, it allows them to survive for an entire winter. Hibernation is different from sleep because animals undergo several stages of hibernation, including deep sleep, torpor, and hibernation.

Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's a complex issue, and I am not a historian. But I will try to give you my view on the subject. I will start by saying that the US government was clearly wrong in sending troops to Vietnam, and that it was wrong to force people to serve.  The Vietnam war was a military disaster and a huge loss of human life.  Many people who were drafted to serve were sent to fight in Vietnam, even though they were not trained for it.

It was also wrong to force people to serve, and many people were sent to", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: I am a scientist.  I have not discussed this with other scientists, but I do not see why it would not be possible.  A full genome sequence of a Neanderthal is sufficient to recreate one using human eggs and sperm.  I would imagine that it would be possible to do this in the near future.  I do not know what the scientific process would be, but I would imagine that the first step would be to sequence the genomes of multiple Neanderthals and then to start with the first Neanderthal to have its full genome sequenced.

Shrimp contain the pigment astaxanthin, which is responsible for the orange color. When the temperature of shrimp increases, the pigment breaks down, resulting in the loss of color. The pigment in red meat does not break down easily, resulting in the brown color.\n\nAnother reason why red meat turns brown is that when meat is cooked, it loses its myoglobin, which is responsible for the red", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: In the absence of a number, it cannot do anything.

I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: He was in a compressed air tank, and the fireworks were in a shell that was attached to a rocket, which was attached to a launcher that was attached to a compressed air tank. The compressed air tank was filled with a high pressure of air. The high pressure of air, which was also attached to the firework shell, forced the shell to the top of the tank. The shell then exploded, sending the shell to the bottom of the tank, and the tank to the bottom of the guy's head. The shell hit the guy's head, and the high pressure of air", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder.

However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: There are multiple reasons for this.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Let's look at each of the sounds we make to understand this.\n\n- We use our tongue, lips, jaw, and vocal folds to create different sounds.\n- The vocal folds are muscles in our throat that vibrate to make sound.\n- We have two sets of vocal folds, and they work together to make sounds.\n\n- Each vibration lasts about 1/2 second.\n- When we speak, the vibrations are very short, so they sound like one continuous sound.\n- But when we sing, the vibrations are very long", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When a cloud is blown through the sky, it does not change shape because the water vapour in the cloud is distributed evenly throughout the cloud. However, if the wind speed is strong enough, the cloud may break up into smaller pieces and change its shape.\n\nThe wind speed must be fast enough for the cloud to break into pieces. However, this is usually not the case, so the cloud will only change its shape when it is blown at a high speed.\n\nThe wind speed is usually fast enough to break up a cloud when the cloud is near the ground. However, when a cloud is high", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, there are several factors at play. Firstly, larger animals have to eat more to sustain their large mass, which requires more energy to acquire. This means that a large animal must have a greater food supply to sustain it for a long time, and this becomes harder to find as the animal grows larger. However, smaller animals tend to have a smaller surface area, and so don\u2019t need to eat as much to sustain their mass. This also means that they can survive on a smaller amount of food, and have more energy to spare to perform other tasks. They can also move more easily and so", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Mom and dad are the two people who care for us from the moment we are born.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver is responsible for most of the work of digestion and metabolism. The liver breaks down fats and proteins into their building blocks, which can then be used by the body. The liver also stores bile, which is used to digest fats. The bile is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. After a meal, the bile is released into the small intestine, where it breaks down fats. After it breaks down fats, the bile is stored in the gallbladder again until the next meal.", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV is called the \nhum. It is a form of background noise that occurs when a TV is on. The hum can be caused by \nthe TV itself or the AC power. When the TV is on, the AC power is causing the hum. When the TV is \nturned off, the AC power is not causing the hum. The AC power is only causing the hum when the TV \nis on. It is called the AC power hum because it occurs when the AC power is on. The AC power hum \nis caused by", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The main reason batteries run out of power is due to the chemical reactions within the battery.\nAs the battery is used the chemicals within the battery are used up, and the chemicals cannot be re-generated within the battery.\nThe amount of chemicals used in the battery is dependent on the current draw from the battery.\nFor example, if the battery is used for a short period of time the chemicals are used up less than if the battery is used for a longer period of time.\nThe amount of chemicals used within the battery is also dependent on the charge of the battery.\nFor example,", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

It is a case to case basis. For example, people would find a tiger cub cute, but not a dog. People would find a tiger cub cute because it is a part of the family tiger, which is a part of the family cat. However, if we were to find a wolf cub cute, it would not be a part of the family wolf, it would be a part of the family dog. It is also a matter of how we perceive the animal. For example, we would find a", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a technology that enables the transmission of both power and data over a single cable. This technology was first developed in 1999 by Atheros Communications, and the IEEE 802.3af standard was published in 2003. The power portion of PoE is transmitted using the same wires as the data portion, and the amount of power required is small enough to be supplied by a low-power DC-DC converter.\n\nPoE is a convenient technology that can be used to supply power to devices such as IP phones", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: As far as we know, the reason why we can see colours is because of the cone cells in our retina. The cone cells are specialized cells that detect different wavelengths of light. The cone cells are responsible for our ability to see colours and are the reason why we can see colour in the daytime when light is available.\n\nThe cone cells have a specialized structure that allows them to detect light at different wavelengths. When light hits the cone cells, it is either absorbed or reflected. The absorbed light is turned into a chemical signal that is sent to the brain. The reflected light", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 3rd world countries are underdeveloped due to a variety of factors. \nThe most important of which is the lack of government support. \n3rd world countries have governments that have little to no resources to assist in the development of their country.\nThe lack of resources leads to a lack of infrastructure, which leads to a lack of industry and development.\nAdditionally, 3rd world countries have little to no investment in education.\nThis leads to a lack of skilled labor, which leads to a lack of industry and development.\nThe lack of infrastructure and education also leads to a", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: A government computer can be accessible via the internet, but not on its own secure network. This is because a government computer is typically connected to the internet to access information. \n\nHowever, a government computer is not typically connected to a private network, because the private network is not managed by the government. Instead, a government computer is typically connected to a private network through a router, which is managed by the government. \n\nIf a government computer is connected to the internet, it can be attacked by malicious actors. Since the government typically controls the router that is connected to the internet, it can block malicious traffic and", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: A few reasons: 1. The cabbage releases water from the cell walls as the salt draws water out of the cells. 2. If you look closely, you will see that the cabbage is not completely cut up, but the cells have been broken a little bit. This allows the water to escape more easily. 3. This is a process called \"wetting\", and it happens when the surface of a cell is broken and the cell is exposed to water. The cell will draw water from the surrounding environment into the cell.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Wrinkly hands are caused by a loss of moisture, so when in water for a long time, the hands lose water and get wrinkly. This is because the skin loses its water and gets soft. When our hands are in water for a long time, it loses water from the outer layers of the skin. When this happens, the skin gets wrinkly and soft. When the skin loses moisture, the skin loses elasticity. This is why wrinkly hands become soft.\n\nWrinkly hands are caused by a loss of moisture, so", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The Moon's light is not as bright as stars, which are billions of light years away, which makes it harder to see the equipment left on the Moon by the Apollo astronauts.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It depends on how much liquid you drink and how much you lose in the process.\nFor example, a 12-ounce serving of soda contains about 100 calories, while a cup of coffee contains about 150 calories.\nWhile you're drinking the liquid, your body is using some of its water reserves to dissolve the calories, so it's losing water.\nDrinking too much water can also lead to dehydration because you're losing more water than your body can make up for.\nAlcohol also dehydr", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hispanic refers to a person's origin, culture, ancestry, language, or nationality, while Latino is a label used by the United States government to refer to people of Latin American origin.

Some terror groups use newspapers, magazines, and television to announce their attacks. Others claim responsibility through statements issued by their leaders. In the past, some terrorists used the Internet to claim responsibility for their attacks. However, the Internet has become a more difficult place to communicate with the public due to the efforts of law enforcement, including the use of social media platforms by terror groups. In the future, terrorists may claim responsibility by publishing a message in a newspaper or by announcing it through a video posted on a social media platform.", "\n\nHuman: The Monty Hall Paradox/Problem\n\nI was inspired by reading [this comment](_URL_0_) as well as the explanation given in the movie 21.\n\nThe basics of the problem, taken from the link above:\n\n >  the monty hall paradox, you are given a choice of three doors with a prize behind one, you pick door #3. door #2 is opened, there is nothing behind it. you are given the the choice to switch your choice from door #3 to door #1, doing so increases your chances of winning every single time.\n\nI know this has been posted before, but I can't for the life of me wrap my head around it.

Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are two reasons why this is the case. First, it would be much more energy efficient to use one machine to wash and dry clothes rather than two. Second, it would be much more economical to use one machine to wash and dry clothes rather than two. This would save the consumer money on their energy bill, and the manufacturer would save money on production costs.\n\nAnother reason why this is the case is because the cost of the materials needed to make a machine that washes and dries clothes would be much more expensive than the cost of two machines that wash and dry clothes separately.", "\n\nHuman: From crack to current, what is the story behind Toronto mayor Rob Ford?\n\nWhat has Toronto mayor Rob Ford been accused of doing?

The coolest part of your body is your skin, so the body tries to move the heat away from your skin and into the air. When you feel hot, your skin is trying to warm up the air around it, so it can cool down and feel cool again.\n\nWhen someone touches your skin, the heat from your skin is transferred to the person touching it. Since the person is now warmer, they feel colder. This is called the Heat Transfer Effect. When you feel cold, your skin is trying to warm up the air around it,", "\n\nHuman: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: \"It's the amps which kill you not volts.\" But, wouldn't amps be always constant for given volt, as R=V/I.
