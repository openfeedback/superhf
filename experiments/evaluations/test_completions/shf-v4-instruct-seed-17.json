A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The difference in performance is quite large. The AMD CPUs have more cores than Intel's, which is great if you need a lot of cores. But since you don't need a lot of cores, you should get the Intel CPU instead.\n\nThe reason why Intel CPUs are more expensive is that they have a lot more transistors and thus require more time and money to make. The more transistors you have, the more power you can use. The more power you use, the faster the CPU is.\n\nThe difference in performance between these two CPUs is roughly 1.5x", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The twitching of the eyelid is caused by the muscle that moves the eyelid.

What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: A good explanation can be found in the physical properties of water.  Water is a polar molecule, which means that the molecule is made up of positively-charged hydrogen atoms and negatively-charged oxygen atoms. The bond between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms is stronger than the attraction between the oxygen atoms.\n\nWhen water is in a liquid state, the molecules are close enough to each other to form a hydrated lattice. However, when water is in a gaseous state, the molecules are further apart. Since the bond between the oxygen and hydro", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and most powerful particle collider, which is used to research the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces that act between them.

The political left supports the red", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Time is a measurement of how long it takes for an object to complete one full orbit around the sun. As an object completes one orbit, it travels a distance of approximately 584 million miles.\n\nThe Earth travels around the Sun at a speed of about 67,000 miles per hour. As it travels, the Earth also rotates on its axis at a speed of about 1,000 miles per hour. This rotation causes the Sun to appear to rise in the east and set in the west.\n\nIn addition, the Earth orbits the Sun in an elli", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is the basic unit of length in the International System of Units, SI. The meter was originally defined in 1793 as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole through Paris. In 1960, this definition was revised and the meter was defined in terms of a specific number of wavelengths of a certain emission line of krypton-86. The meter is currently defined as the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,4", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Soap in the eye causes excruciating pain when you are little, because the cornea is very sensitive. This is because the cornea is the transparent front part of the eye that covers the iris and pupil, and allows light to pass into the eye. The cornea protects the eye from injury and is the most sensitive part of the eye. Soap in the eye causes pain because it stings and burns the cornea. This causes the eye to produce tears, which flush out the soap. When the soap is washed out of the eye, the pain stops. After the pain stops, the", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Planet Nine is a hypothetical planet in the Solar System with an estimated mass between that of Earth and Neptune.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Ancient and prehistoric human remains from children have been found because many of the sites where they were found are children's graves. This is because children were often buried with their parents or other family members. \n\nAnother reason why remains from children have been found is because they are very well preserved.  In the case of the Ice Man, the remains were found in a glacier, which is cold and dry.  This means that the body did not decay and was perfectly preserved. \n\nChildren's remains are also often found in archaeological sites because they were the ones who were taken care", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The physical differences between male and female in species are the result of the sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism refers to the differences in the physical characteristics of males and females of a given species. Sexual dimorphism is seen in many species of animals and plants, and it is one of the main ways in which organisms are classified into separate sexes.
