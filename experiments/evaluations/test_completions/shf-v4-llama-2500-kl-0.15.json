Newly appointed head of Xbox is Stephen Elop of Nokia. How did he get a 15 million euro bonus from Nokia when the company lost 15 billion under his control?\n\nAccording his wiki \" During the 3 years Elop was Nokia CEO, Nokia revenues fell 40%, Nokia profits fell 95%, Nokia market share collapsed in smartphones from 34% to 3.4%, Nokia's credit rating went from A to junk, Nokia's share price dropped 60% in value and Nokia's market capitalization lost 13 Billion dollars in value. The Financial Times calculated that Nokia shareholders ended up paying Elop a bonus of 1 million Euros for every 1.5 billion in market capital that Elop was able to destroy while Nokia CEO.\"\n\nI must have zero understanding of how bonuses are supposed to work. This guy is one example, but there are many others. \n\nAssistant: Bonuses are supposed to reward people for doing a good job. Bonuses are based on the value the employee brings to the company. Elop was able to reduce Nokia's market share from 34% to 3.4% while increasing the company's revenues and profits. If Elop was able to do that, he must be a very valuable employee and should be rewarded.\n\nBonuses are also supposed to be based on the company's performance. If the company is not doing well, the bonus will be smaller.\n\nBonuses are also", "\n\nHuman: Does a charge of attempted murder include all of the crimes that go into the attempt?\n\nIf you say try to murder someone by kidnapping them, beating them up and then stabbing them several times, is the kidnapping and beating and stabbing included in the attempted murder charge or are all actions charged in addition to the attempted murder?\n\nHow does the law handle that?\n\nAssistant: You are speaking to an attorney.

I'm sure you've heard of a \"cancer-free\" label for meat.  This means that the meat was raised in a way that greatly reduced the risk of cancer.

A record label is a company that releases and distributes music, movies, and other content. A record label provides artists with the resources and expertise they need to produce, market, and distribute their music.
