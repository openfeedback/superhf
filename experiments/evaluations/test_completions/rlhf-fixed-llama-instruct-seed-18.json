So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is a carbohydrate that your body breaks down into glucose for energy.  While sugar provides energy, it does not provide any other nutrition.\n\nIn fact, it is a source of empty calories and the body is not able to store it for later.  Sugar can lead to weight gain if consumed in excess.  If you consume too much sugar, your body will store the excess sugar in the form of fat.\n\nSugar can also lead to a host of health issues such as tooth decay, diabetes, and metabolic", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: If I understand your question correctly, it is possible that you could travel to another location in the galaxy and experience a different amount of time. This is due to the speed at which you are traveling. As you travel faster, time will slow down for you. This is because light moves at a constant speed, and time is measured by the speed of light. You could experience a year's worth of time while traveling at 10% the speed of light, but a year would take 10 years at 90% the speed of light.\n\nThis is what is known as the Time Dilation", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is the unit of length in the International System of Units and is defined by the following: \n\n\n\nThe meter is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during time interval of", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons for this. First, your brain is not very good at predicting how you will feel from what you can see. So, as a child, it feels like you will be in pain for a long time because you can't see how much pain you will feel. This is not true, though. As you get older, your brain is better at predicting how much pain you will feel. When you are an adult, your brain is more accurate, so your brain predicts that you will only feel a little bit of pain, not a lot of pain. Your brain is also better at making your", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They have actually detected the 9th planet, but it is too far away to confirm that it is a planet. The planet is called 'Planet Nine', and it is located 100 times further away from the Sun than Neptune.

In fact, it is a beneficial trait. Female black widows cannibalize their mates after mating to avoid having to provide for a male that cannot reproduce. This helps the female black widow to save energy for other tasks such as egg production and raising her offspring. In fact, cannibalism is a very common behavior in the animal kingdom. In some species, cannibalism is even a life-saving behavior. In the case of black widow cannibalism, it is", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The sweetness of the fruit is not a direct consequence of the seed dispersal but rather a secondary effect of the fruit's adaptations to the environment where it grows. The adaptations are selected for by the environment and not the other way around. As a result, the fruits of many plants are not as sweet as the fruits of animals.  There are some exceptions.  For example, some fruits that grow in the sea are sweet. The fruits of the mangrove are sweeter than the fruits of the trees that grow in the forests. There are several reasons for this.  First", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: The product placement in movies is a very common practice.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Assume that you are flipping a coin and that the coin is fair.\n\nThe probability of the coin landing heads is 0.5.\n\nThe probability of the coin landing tails is 0.5.\n\nThe probability of the coin landing heads or tails is 1.\n\n\nLet f be the number of times the coin lands heads in a row.\n\nLet h be the number of times the coin lands heads in the first f flips.\n\nLet t be the number of times the coin lands tails in the first f flips.", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Light guns used in games such as Duck Hunt and Time Crisis were simply a more advanced form of laser. Light guns are much more complex than laser guns as they have a greater range of light and the ability to scan the light beam. They also have the ability to change the light beam's speed in order to achieve a desired effect, such as the ability to shoot a bullet or the ability to cause a laser beam to move in a straight line. The NES light gun was a more advanced form of the laser gun as it was able to scan the light beam in order to determine the distance of", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 5: 4: 3: 2: 1: 12: 11: 10: 9: 8: 7: 6: 5: 4: 3: 2: 1: 12: 11: 10: 9: 8: 7: 6: 5: 4: 3: 2: 1: 12: 11: 10: 9: 8: 7: 6: 5: 4: 3: 2", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: 0 divided by 0 is not a valid expression.", "\n\nHuman: why does comcast Internet slow down despite offering 20+mbps\n\nAssistant: Comcast Internet is a broadband service which means that the speed is not always constant. The speed of the Internet will vary depending on the usage. For example, if you are downloading a large file, then the Internet will slow down. Another factor which can affect the speed is the location of your Internet connection. If you are located in an area which has a lot of Internet users, then the speed of your Internet will decrease.

I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: The reason for this is because there is a strong cultural association between childhood and the innocence and purity of a person. Therefore, it is often used as a theme in Japanese manga and anime to emphasize the struggles and the conflicts of the characters in their childhood.\n\nFor example, the manga \"Naruto\" is about a young ninja named Naruto who was born as an outcast and is bullied by his village mates because of his appearance.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: That would be very difficult.  There are many different kinds of Neanderthals, and there is only one genome available from one individual.  There is no evidence that Neanderthals had different types of genomes.  Even if they did, we would not be able to use that information to create a new species.  The genome is not enough to create a new species.  There are many other genes in the body, and we would need to know the exact location of those genes in the genome.  We would need to know the exact timing of when the different genes are expressed in", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender is someone who identifies with a different gender than they were assigned at birth.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam?

If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: When a vehicle is in a freeway and it is going under an overpass, it must be at the speed that is allowed in that freeway.

However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: I think that this has to do with the fact that people with higher educations tend to be more open-minded, and tend to think critically and in a more nuanced way. The more you learn, the more you tend to be able to think through and understand a range of complex issues. So, for example, while a lot of people are still convinced that climate change is a hoax, people with a higher education and a more nuanced perspective on the issue have recognized the evidence that it is happening and are working towards solutions. This is just one example of how people with a higher education tend to be more open", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons why this happens.  When you speak, you use your vocal cords to create a sound.  The vocal cords are on the larynx, which is on the top of your lungs. When you sing, you use the same vocal cords, but you use your lungs instead of your larynx. The larynx is on the top of your lungs, but the lungs are on the bottom of your chest. This makes it difficult to make the same sound when you sing.  It is a little like playing a piano with one hand, and a keyboard with the", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's the same as why we maintain our shape.  We're made of water, air, and other materials, but we don't maintain a shape because of the water in us.  The same is true for the clouds.  They're made of mostly water, but they maintain their shape because they have a lot of air in them, too.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: 1. There is no evidence that smaller animals live shorter lives. There are many factors that affect the lifespan of animals including their diet, environment, and genetics. 2. Larger animals live longer because they have more cells that divide and repair damage. This means their cells have more time to repair damage. 3. Larger animals also have more cells that die. This means there is a greater chance of a damaged cell dying, which means there is less chance of the damage spreading to other cells. 4. Larger animals also have more cells that do not divide, which means they", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In English, we call our parents mom and dad.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are the most significant digits used in a number. For example, the number 25.75 would have two significant digits.\n\nThe number 25.75 has been rounded to two significant digits. 25.75 is the exact number. 25.75 can be rounded to 25.7.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Your liver is responsible for making and releasing bile.  Bile is a mixture of water, bile salts, and cholesterol.  The bile is stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine to help break down fat.\n\nYour liver also makes glucose from stored carbohydrate and protein.  The glucose then goes into the blood stream and is used by the body.\n\nYour pancreas also makes a juice called  pancreatic juice which contains enzymes that help break down fats", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: That's the sound of the TV's signal going through the tuner.

I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: I think it's just because kids like to spin.

This means the\ntwo cables are separate. The power is then sent over a separate wire. This\nis very important because power is very different from data.\n\nIt is very dangerous to mix the two together because the power can damage the\ndata wire and vice versa. In fact, it is not even possible to send data over\na power wire as the data needs to be digital and the power is not.\n\nWhen power is sent over a wire, it is called Power over E", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer to this question depends on how you define ``see'' colours. If you mean how we are able to perceive colours, then we are very much like most of other animals, because we perceive colours through the same mechanism as our cats, dogs and birds. The difference is that we also have a brain that allows us to understand the meaning of colours. For example, we know that the colour red means danger, while the colour green means food. Similarly, the colour blue means cold, while the colour yellow means warm. Thus, we see colours, but we also understand the meaning of colours.\n\nHowever,", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: One of the reasons is because they lack basic infrastructure and also the political system in these countries. Also, because of the lack of basic infrastructure, it is difficult for these countries to implement new technology. In the 3rd world countries, there is also a lack of proper education. The 3rd world countries are also very poor and they cannot afford to invest in infrastructure.\n\nAnother reason is the political system of these countries. In the 3rd world countries, there is no proper political system. The ruling party is also not stable and so they do not implement new policies.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: When you cut cabbage, you are cutting the cells and making them release their contents, including water. If you add salt, the water will be attracted to the salt and will release from the cabbage. If the cabbage is left in the bowl for a long time, it will release all its water.\n\nThe same happens with zucchini.

The Moon is over 380,000 km away from Earth, and light travels at about 300,000,000 m/s, or 300,000,000,000 m/h, or 1,080,000,000 km/h. So light travels over 1,080,000,000 km in about 1.2 seconds. At that speed, it would take light over 380", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Drinking a liquid will always cause you to become dehydrated because your body will be taking the water from your body to process the liquid. This is because the human body is made up of 60% water. This is why it is important to always drink water when you are thirsty and not drinking a liquid.

Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The clothes washer and clothes dryer are two separate machines because they do two different things: one washes the clothes, and the other dries them. This helps to keep the two processes separate.\n\nWashing the clothes uses water, which is used up and needs to be replenished. This is done by adding water to the washing machine.\n\nDrying the clothes uses the heat from the dryer to help evaporate the water from the clothes. This process uses up the heat from the dryer.

First, the research suggests that psychotherapy is more effective when it can be arranged to suit the patient. Second, some psychotherapists who work after hours may have already been working a full day. I therefore believe that they are more likely to be exhausted, and so less effective than other psychotherapists. Finally, the research also suggests that the longer the length of the therapy session, the more effective it is. Therefore, I believe that it is better to see a psychotherapist who works in the morning.
