A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these?

How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: It's not realistic.  People with terminal cancer are not generally symptom free.  They have a lot of pain and nausea.  They lose weight, and have a lot of fatigue.  They are often in the hospital, getting IV fluids.  They can't eat or drink much.  They have a lot of trouble breathing.  They are often constipated or have diarrhea.  They can't sleep.  They have trouble concentrating.  They can't do much.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: There's nothing wrong with sugar.

It is a neurotransmitter that is released during exercise and binds to the cannabinoid receptors in the brain. Anandamide is produced when the body breaks down fatty acids, and it is released in the brain when the body is stressed.

Why?\n\nAssistant: It's the food.  Chinese food is made with a lot of spices and sauces,  and it's not that easy to make those things at home.  A lot of Chinese food is fried,  and it's hard to get the right texture.  You need a wok,  and a specialized burner,  and you have to fry it at just the right temperature.

The locomotive is connected to the cars by a series of rails. The locomotive is connected to the rails by a series of wheels. The locomotive pulls the train using the wheels on the locomotive.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Water molecules are polar.

The right supported the monarchy, the left supported the revolutionary government.\n\nThe right believes in a strong government, with few rights for citizens. The right wants to use government to protect the rights of the wealthy and privileged. The right believes that the government should have a lot of power and control over the lives of citizens.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The way you experience time is not determined by the length of the time period, but rather by the rate at which you experience the passage of time.  For example, if you are on a spaceship that is traveling at a constant velocity of 0.6c, time will pass at a slower rate on the ship than it does on Earth.  In fact, it will pass at a rate that is about 20% slower than it does on Earth.  This means that if you traveled for one year on the spaceship, when you returned to Earth, you would have actually been gone for 2", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We measure the meter as 1/100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They're just lazy.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A black widow spider, also known as a venomous spider, is a spider of the genus Latrodectus (meaning \"snake killer\"), in the family Theridiidae.

For example, a person's hormone levels change during puberty, which can have a major impact on their desire for sex.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The sequencing of the Neanderthal genome is a very exciting development for paleoanthropologists.  It is important to keep in mind, however, that sequencing a genome does not tell us much about the biology of the organism.  The genome is the blueprint for an organism, but it is not the organism itself.  A genome contains the information necessary to create a particular organism, but it is not enough to create one.  It also does not tell us how an organism functions.
