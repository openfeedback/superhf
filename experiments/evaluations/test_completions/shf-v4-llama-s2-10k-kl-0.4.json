How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: It works a little like this. When a movie is released, the studio is responsible for paying the cast. The studio does this by taking a portion of the box office, which is typically around 50%. The studio then pays the cast their salary, which is also typically 50%. The remainder of the money, which is typically between 10-20%, is then split between the theaters that showed the movie and the movie production company. \n\nThe theater will typically keep 60-80% of the money they made from the movie, and the remaining 20-", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor.

It is caused by a decrease in body temperature and a decrease in body metabolism. When the body temperature drops, the body goes into a state of deep sleep, and the body stops metabolizing food and other things. The body does not recover so quickly because it has been in a state of hibernation, and the body needs time to recover and repair itself. Hibernation is different from sleep because sleep is a state of consciousness, while hibernation is a state of unconsciousness.

I am not a scientist, so I can only answer your question based on my understanding of the scientific process.\n\nFirst, I would like to clarify that the process of bringing a Neanderthal back into existence would be very difficult, if not impossible.  The reason for this is that the Neanderthal genome is very different from that of a modern human.  This is because the Neanderthal genome has evolved over many generations, while the modern human genome has not.
