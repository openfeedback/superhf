So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: It's both.  Sugar is calorie dense, which means that you will get more calories per gram of sugar than you would of a gram of fat or protein.  This can lead to overeating if you aren't careful.  The second part of your question is that sugar isn't inherently bad for you.  It's actually very good for you.  It's just that it can be very bad for you if you don't control how much you eat.\n\nSugar is a carbohydrate, which means that it provides energy for your body", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: I'd say, first off, it's because children tend to be smaller. This makes them easier to find in the first place, as a small bone is easier to spot than a larger bone in a jumbled up pile of dirt. The fact that children tend to be smaller also means that they are less likely to be buried with a lot of other people, and thus, the bones are less likely to be disturbed or destroyed. The fact that they are less likely to be buried with a lot of other people also means that they are more likely to be found in isolation, which", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer is that it was in the case of lions that the male and female were very similar in appearance.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Well, I think that the coin flip is dependent on the previous flip, but that the probability of the coin flip being dependent on the previous flip is very low, so it is basically independent.", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It uses infrared technology to detect your hand movements.", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: They can still get deported.", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: why does comcast Internet slow down despite offering 20+mbps\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, but I do not understand your question.", "\n\nHuman: how do apps like prankdial work?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens if you ignore medical bills?
