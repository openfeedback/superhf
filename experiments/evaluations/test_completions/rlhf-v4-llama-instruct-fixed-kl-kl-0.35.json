The supply of currency is determined by the government of that country and the demand for the currency is determined by the need of citizens and businesses to exchange goods and services for currency.\n\nWhen the supply of currency exceeds the demand for currency, the currency will be worth less than it is worth when the demand exceeds the supply.\n\nWhen the supply of currency", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hippies were able to afford to travel cross country because they were able to do many odd jobs and make enough money to pay for their travels.

They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: You have a very valid question, and I'm glad you're here to ask it. The reason you're seeing this is because of the price difference in the market. The difference is mainly due to the different CPU manufacturers.\n\nThe AMD CPUs you're looking at are AMD Ryzen 5 6-Core processors, and Intel CPUs you're looking at are Intel Core i7 6-Core processors.\n\nAMD is an American multinational semiconductor company that designs and sells computer processors and related technologies.

Why?\n\nAssistant: Well, to be honest, we don't really know, but we can guess.

The rules of the grammar are combined into a \n\nfinite state machine. The grammar rules are recursive, and they can also be combined together in a number of ways. This allows for a variety of grammars to be \n\ncreated, each one with a unique set of rules and a unique structure. The grammar rules are composed of a number of \" productions\", which are", "\n\nHuman: why almost every japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children\n\nI have just noticed this trend tbh and i never wondered why this was. It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing.

The brain can learn 3,000 words in a year and can recognize a few hundred thousand different spoken sounds. However, only about 200 of these sounds can be used to create a language. To learn a language, the brain must be able to distinguish between all of these sounds.", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: They use their hands to search for the signs and then feel for the braille.", "\n\nHuman: What volume of water is required to drown a human?\n\nAnd a second, slightly sillier question, can someone drown swallowing only a mouthful of water?\n\nAssistant: I don't know the volume of water required to drown a human, but I know that it would be a lot. I'm going to answer the second question first. The answer is yes, it is possible to drown swallowing a mouthful of water, but it would be incredibly difficult to do so. \n\nIt is very easy to drown by accident. If you don't know how to swim, or don't know how to swim well, or are too tired to swim, or don't know how to float, it is very easy to drown.", "\n\nHuman: what is the reason for those few extra blank white pages in the back of a book?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I believe the purpose of a few extra blank white pages in the back of a book is to allow the reader to make notes.", "\n\nHuman: Meditation\n\nHow do I do it?

For example, if a candidate is named Joe Biden, but there is another candidate named Joe Biden who is running for a different office, then it would be difficult to win a write in campaign. However, if there is a Joe Biden who is running for the same office as you, and that candidate is not in the race, then your name could potentially win a write in campaign.\n\nIn the end, it all depends on the amount of write in candidates that are running, and the number of people who vote", "\n\nHuman: How did people used to train pigeons to carry mail at the long distance, back in the day?\n\nI was always curious, did they have different pigeon for each address and if not, how pigeon knows whom to send? \n\nAssistant: Well, I'm not sure how they did it, but I've always wondered the same thing!", "\n\nHuman: Why are people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war shamed instead of admired?

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The first thing that we need to consider is the definition of a Neanderthal.  The definition is that of a hominid that is 100% modern human and 0% Neanderthal, and is therefore different to a hybrid, which has 50% modern human and 50% Neanderthal DNA.  Secondly, we need to consider whether or not the DNA of a Neanderthal is even possible to replicate in a human.  Thirdly, we need to consider how a Neanderthal would be brought back into existence, and finally, we", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The term \"transgender\" has come to encompass a broad range of identities and experiences.

I think you are asking about the difference between a zero and a division by zero.\n\nThe calculator shows an error when you divide something by zero.\n\nThe zero is not an actual number. It is a placeholder for zero, which is the number of objects.\n\nWhen you divide something by zero, you are saying \"How many objects are there in the whole thing, divided by zero?\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nThe calculator is not designed to do this.\n\nIt is designed to calculate numbers and do mathematical operations", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It is not only the taste that makes people love fast food, but also the convenience.", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but it seems that more and more people are becoming more polarized on the issue of climate change and global warming.", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods?

It's also called the set of all sets which are not members of themselves.\n\n\n\n\nThis statement is a paradox because it is self-contradictory. The reason is that if it were true, it would be a set, and so it would be a set of sets which are not members of themselves. That's not possible, so the statement is not true.\n\n\n\n\nThe statement is self-contradictory because it says that a set", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: It's hard to pinpoint exactly why Iranian attitudes to transsexuality are so liberal.\n\nThere is a good deal of literature on the subject.\n\nOne of the main reasons for Iran's liberal views on the subject is that the Islamic Republic of Iran is a Shi'a country. Shi'a Islam is more accepting of LGBTQ+ people, and this is reflected in their attitudes to transsexuality.\n\nThe other reason is that Iranian society is very conservative and traditional, but at the same time very modern and progressive.\n\nTh", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine?

If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: This is a question that has come up time and time again in the past. The question is, why is this sign there? Well, the short answer is: It is to provide information to drivers and to make them aware of something that they might not be aware of. If you are in a large truck, or a small vehicle, and you are passing under an overpass and you are concerned about the clearance height, you can stop and find out. You can make the appropriate adjustments to your vehicle, and then proceed.", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly.

This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: Noise is a form of energy. It travels through a medium, usually air, and when the air gets colder, the molecules move slower, allowing more energy to be transferred to a given area.", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: I don't think there is a direct correlation between higher education and liberalism. It's more of a correlation between higher education and intelligence. Intelligent people tend to be liberal, but that's not because of higher education.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Well, there are lots of reasons for this. It might be because of the way they are singing, or their vocal range, or how they are breathing. It might also be because of their speaking voice.\n\nIt could also be due to the way they are trained to sing, and the way they were taught to sing. For example, if you have a strong accent when speaking, it is likely that you will also have a strong accent when singing.\n\nAlso, the way that you breathe when singing can affect your singing. If you breathe in the wrong way, it can cause a", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer is very simple. In a cloud, the water vapour is suspended in the air and this forms a layer of tiny droplets. When you blow, it blows the air and the water droplets in the air with it. But the droplets are very light and they are very small. So, they move around a lot and they are blown in every direction. So, they don't maintain a shape.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: There is no simple answer to this question. But I can tell you that the life span of an animal is affected by a variety of factors. One factor is genetics. For example, we know that the life span of a species can be determined by the length of its genome. For example, the life span of a fruit fly is about 2 months, while the life span of a mouse is about 2 years. Another factor is the environment. For example, the life span of a species can be affected by the environmental conditions in which it lives. For example, the life span of a species is likely to be", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure what you mean.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: It is important to remember that the liver does not have a direct role in the digestion of lipids. Rather, the liver takes in the excess bile that is not used in the small intestine and stores it for use later. The liver is responsible for many other important functions, such as detoxification, but the bile does not play a role in the breakdown of fats.\n\nThe liver also has a role in the regulation of fat metabolism. The liver has the ability to convert excess dietary fat to triglycerides and store them in the", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: 1.

He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure. I can only think of two reasons. One is that they might be trying to get dizzy. This is probably more of a rarity though. The other reason could be that they are feeling unbalanced and they are trying to rebalance themselves. Again, I'm not sure.", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the Big Bang Theory?", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'll count them for you.", "\n\nHuman: The Jerry Springer Show\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Good morning!", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: It's hard to explain why we find certain animals cute, especially when it's a wild animal. For example, many of us find baby deer, or baby kangaroo, cute. But why? It's because we have a certain evolutionary desire to want to care for and protect the young, especially when it's a similar species to our own. So, that's the reason why we find certain animals cute. But in the case of dangerous animals, it's a little bit harder to explain. But again, it's because we have an evolutionary desire to care", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet is a technology that transmits power and data over the same cable.

The world is underdeveloped because many countries don't have the technology and infrastructure to develop their own countries. The countries that don't have the technology and infrastructure to develop their own countries are called 3rd world countries. The 3rd world countries don't have the technology and infrastructure to develop their own countries because the countries that do have technology and infrastructure are richer and more powerful than them.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: I am not sure, but I think it has to do with the fibers in the cabbage. They are soft and the salt is dissolved in the water, but the fibers are not dissolved and they stay hard, and as the cabbage releases water, it pushes out the fibers from the soft cabbage, and the fibers are the ones that are dissolved in the water and releasing the water.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are three main factors that contribute to the wrinkles that form on the skin when it is exposed to water for a long time.\n\nThe first is the surface tension of the water. Surface tension is a property of a liquid that makes it hard to pull a liquid across a surface, like a wall. When you put your hand in water, it is easy to pull your hand out of the water, but it is harder to pull the water out of the hand. This is because of the surface tension of the water.\n\nThe second factor is evaporation. When a liquid evaporates", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because it's too far away.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is not drinking liquid that dehydrates you, but the liquid itself. If you drink too much liquid, you will have to pee. 10% of the liquid you drink becomes urine. 60% of the liquid you drink becomes pee. 30% of the liquid you drink becomes sweat. So, if you drink 100 mL of liquid, 10 mL becomes urine, 60 mL becomes pee, and 30 mL becomes sweat. 30 mL of liquid is a very small amount.

The cold-touch illusion is a perceptual illusion that involves a person feeling that their skin is cold when it is not. The illusion is created by the fact that the body's temperature is always higher than the surrounding air, so when a person's skin is exposed to a cooler temperature, the skin feels warmer. The cold-touch illusion can be created by the application of an ice cube to the forehead, which causes the skin to feel cold.
