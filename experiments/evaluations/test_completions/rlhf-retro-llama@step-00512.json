How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: You are correct that the time you spend traveling in space will differ from the time you spent on Earth. The reason for this is that the speed at which you travel through space affects your perception of time. If you were to travel at the speed of light, you would see no time pass at all, and your perception would be that you had been traveling forever. This is why you age slower when traveling in space. If you were to travel at the speed of light, you would see no time pass, and your perception would be that you had been traveling forever.

How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: 1's and 0's are not sent through the wire.  In order for a computer to send data, it has to convert it into some other form.  The data is sent in the form of electricity.  How much electricity can be sent through a cable depends on the cable.  In general, the higher the voltage, the more electricity can be sent.

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: You would be charged with manslaughter, and go to prison.", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: I think it's derived from the phrase \"one another's side\".

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: It's not possible to bring back a Neanderthal, as the technology does not exist.  However, it is possible to create a Neanderthal-human hybrid.  This has been discussed on other websites.  The process is called \"engineering\" and is done through injecting human DNA into an animal embryo.  The DNA is inserted at the point of fertilization, and the embryo is allowed to develop.  The resultant animal would have human DNA, but would still be a species of that animal.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure if there's a good answer to this.\n\nMy guess is that it's probably related to the fact that Iran is a Shiite country, and that Shiite Islam has a very strong emphasis on gender roles and the role of women in society.\n\nWhile the Sunni world is more accepting of transsexuals, Shiite Islam is much less accepting of homosexuality, and Shiite Islam tends to take a more conservative view of gender roles and the role of women in society.\n\nThis would suggest that Shiite Islam is more accepting", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine?

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are a measure of precision in a number. The higher the number, the more significant digits you need. If you have a number with only one digit, you can only know it to one place, so it has no significant digits. If you have a number with two digits, you can know it to the nearest hundredth, so you have two significant digits.
