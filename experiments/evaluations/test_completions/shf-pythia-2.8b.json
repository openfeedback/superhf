For example, water has a viscosity of 1 centipoise (cps). This means that if you pour 1 cps of water from a pitcher onto a table, the water will flow easily and quickly. A thick liquid will have a higher viscosity, meaning it will take more force to move it. Water is a liquid, but milk is not.

I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: Kirchhoff's First Law states that the current going into a junction is equal to the current coming out of a junction. In other words, the sum of the currents into and out of a circuit is zero. The current that flows into the circuit must equal the current that flows out of the circuit. The current that flows into a circuit is the sum of all the currents that flow into the circuit. The current that flows out of a circuit is the sum of all the currents that flow out of the circuit. This is the definition of current. Kirchhoff's first law states that the current going into a junction is equal to the", "\n\nHuman: Why does rain look stationary from a distance?\n\nWhen looking at a thunderstorm from far away you can see the rain coming down to the ground but it just looks as if the cloud is extended in sheets towards the earth.

The knee is a hinge joint, so the knee bends inwards when it bends forwards, and inwards when it bends backwards. This gives the animal a mechanical advantage. The knee has a lever, so it's able to bend inwards more than it is able to bend outwards. This gives the animal a mechanical advantage.\nWe can deduce from this that the knee is a good way for animals to move. The knee is a good way for animals to move because it has a mechanical advantage, which means that the animal has an advantage over other animals", "\n\nHuman: why I can buy brand new record players in stores, but not needles?\n\nAre there not enough companies manufacturing them?\n\nAssistant: No, it's because we're a small company and we don't want to sell a product we don't believe in.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: I'm afraid I can't provide you with an answer for this question. I can only explain it from my perspective. When a Skype call is in progress, the program is sending data to the other person.
