But there are other types of drugs that are less dangerous.  It\u2019s also possible that you could get caught and go to jail.  And it\u2019s possible that you could get killed.

How did he get a 15 million euro bonus from Nokia when the company lost 15 billion under his control?\n\nAccording his wiki \" During the 3 years Elop was Nokia CEO, Nokia revenues fell 40%, Nokia profits fell 95%, Nokia market share collapsed in smartphones from 34% to 3.4%, Nokia's credit rating went from A to junk, Nokia's share price dropped 60% in value and Nokia's market capitalization lost 13 Billion dollars in value. The Financial Times calculated that Nokia shareholders ended up paying Elop a bonus of 1 million Euros for every 1.5 billion in market capital that Elop was able to destroy while Nokia CEO.\"\n\nI must have zero understanding of how bonuses are supposed to work. This guy is one example, but there are many others. \n\nAssistant: I agree with you. I have no understanding of how bonuses are supposed to work.

I\u2019m not an attorney, and I don\u2019t know about the laws in your state, but I can tell you that in my state, it\u2019s possible for someone to be charged with attempted murder without also being charged with kidnapping or beating or stabbing.", "\n\nHuman: What are the functional differences between a Cray super computer and my 2.7GHz i7 desktop?\n\nI know technology has advanced to a point where I can buy for $500 a device with more computing power than anything built in say, 1990.  What made computers like the Cray so large and expensive, and have the features that they were designed to provide been shrunk and mass-produced with our technological progression?\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the explanations y'all.\n\nAssistant: I can help with that!  I can get a quick overview of the general differences between a Cray supercomputer and a desktop PC.  The Cray is a general purpose supercomputer, which means that it\u2019s a lot more powerful than a desktop PC.  It can do a lot more things, and it can do them much faster.  It\u2019s a general purpose computer, so it can do anything that a desktop PC can do, and it can do it faster.  The Cray is a \u201cparallel supercomputer\u201d and a desktop PC is a \u201cserial computer\u201d.  This means that", "\n\nHuman: why do milk alternatives [soy almond etc] get called milk and not *name* water?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because that\u2019s what they\u2019re called.  Milk is just the name of a substance that\u2019s made by mammals.  And soy and almonds are mammals, and are also called milk.", "\n\nHuman: How come eggs harden when they are boiled while pasta softens?\n\nI searched this question first, and while I found one about eggs hardening, it did not explain the issue regarding pasta. As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: This is a very common question, and it is actually due to the way that eggs and pasta are cooked.  Eggs are boiled, and pasta is cooked in a pot of boiling water.  This means that the water in the pot of pasta is boiling, and the eggs are boiled in a separate pot of water that has not been boiling.", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a pretty complicated question.  I think the short answer is that Russia is trying to protect the Assad government from the rebel groups, which have been fighting for years now.  The longer answer is that Russia has long been a strong ally of the Assad regime, and has been sending aid to the government since the conflict began.  I don\u2019t think Russia is sending troops to Syria to \u201cprotect\u201d the Syrian government, but rather to help Syria defend itself against rebel forces.  Russia has sent military supplies, weapons, and soldiers to Syria in the past, and I", "\n\nHuman: The Watergate scandal and why it happened\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This is not a question.

It is a mathematical definition, and as such is not actually a physical thing.  The definition of a circle is just a way to describe a mathematical object.", "\n\nHuman: what's the difference between the blue circle and the check mark and the white circle and the check mark ( on messenger )\n\nI understand that there is a difference between sent and delivered, but what does that difference mean?\n\nAssistant: Sent is the message that was sent from your computer to the other person's computer.

Eye movements are more rapid than during non-REM sleep, and in some studies it has been found that people who sleep with their eyes closed can have a shorter REM sleep.  But for the most part, people\u2019s eyes move during REM sleep.", "\n\nHuman: Why is eye contact so important?\n\nSerious question!\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s important because it\u2019s a way to communicate that you\u2019re listening.  It\u2019s also a way to show that you\u2019re interested in the other person\u2019s thoughts.  This can help you build a stronger bond with that person, and also make it easier for you to understand them.", "\n\nHuman: With no entrance or exit ramp and no visible road obstruction, how does traffic back up for 2 miles?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Do you have a specific incident in mind?", "\n\nHuman: Why was Benton Mackenzie not allowed to talk about his medical condition during his trial?\n\nTL;DR Benton Mackenzie is a terminal cancer patient in Iowa who was arrested for growing cannabis for the purpose of making CBD oil to treat his tumors.\n\nWhy couldn't he explain why he was growing the plants?\n\nDoes this not violate the sixth amendment to the US Constitution?\n\nAssistant: The sixth amendment to the Constitution says that defendants in criminal trials have the right to \u201ca speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence\u201d.\n\nIt seems that the judge allowed Benton Mackenzie to test", "\n\nHuman: Why can't humans consciously control certain bodily responses and functions?\n\nFor example, (if I understand correctly) if pain is a warning that something is wrong, why can't we 'tell' our brain to stop sending those signals once we realize what it is?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201ctelling our brain to stop sending those signals\u201d, but I can tell you that you can\u2019t just turn off a body part or a bodily function like a muscle or an organ.  In general, we can\u2019t turn off any bodily function.  We can\u2019t tell our brain to stop sending signals, because that\u2019s not how the brain works.  A lot of people try to control their body with willpower, but that doesn\u2019t work.  You can\u2019t control your body with willpower.  Willpower is a mental state,", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is produced in the skin when it is exposed to ultraviolet light from the sun.  It is also found in some foods, like salmon, tuna, sardines, cod, mackerel, and eggs.", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Well, LEDs are a type of light-emitting diode.  A diode is a kind of semiconductor, which is a material that conducts electricity.  In a diode, the electrons are able to move through the material in one direction, and not in the other.  So in a diode, there are two electrodes, and the current is only able to flow through one direction.  In LEDs, the current can flow through the diode only in one direction, but the direction of the current can change in a diode.  In a diode, the current will", "\n\nHuman: How does the box office work? For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The 8m is just the cost of the movie, and I\u2019m not sure how much of that went to the cast, but I\u2019m pretty sure the actors don\u2019t get a cut of the box office.  It sounds like the movie cost a lot of money, but it made back a lot of money.  For example, the movie cost about $165 million to make, and made $173 million in ticket sales.  The movie made a profit of $8 million.", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure how to answer your question, but I'm pretty sure the cancer rate for livestock isn't high.  Can you elaborate on what you mean by \"cancerous cells\" and \"eating meat\"?", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops.

First, hair is made of a protein called keratin, which is a natural oily substance.  Second, hair gets oily because we lose sebum, or natural oils, through our skin.  Third, if we don\u2019t wash our hair for a while, the natural oils build up and become greasy.  Fourth, shampoo washes the grease off of the hair, and also helps to keep the hair moisturized and healthy.", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act is a law that allows business owners to claim religious exemption from laws that they find to be in conflict with their religious beliefs. It was passed in 1993, and it was based on a Supreme Court decision in 1990 that held that the federal government could not impose its own religious views on business owners.", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry is a mathematical theory that relates particles and forces in physics.  It\u2019s based on the idea that for every particle there\u2019s a corresponding force.  For example, an electron has an electric charge, so it should have a corresponding force, the electromagnetic force.  If there\u2019s a force, there must be a particle that has the charge to cause that force, so there should be an electron.  And there\u2019s a whole family of particles and forces.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re asking about eczema on your palms.

I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: What you\u2019re describing is called a \u201cback sprain\u201d or \u201cback strain\u201d. This is when a muscle or ligament is stretched beyond its normal range of motion.

Maybe they could have been supported by family, or had some sort of job that paid them enough to live on.", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I understand what you\u2019re asking. Do you mean why do we sleep?  I\u2019d say we sleep to rest our bodies and minds.  It\u2019s a pretty good thing to do.  And we do need to sleep, we can\u2019t go without it.  We would get sick, and not be able to function well.  We need to sleep to rest our bodies, and to think and learn.  It\u2019s a very good thing to do.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers are machines, and machines are made of parts.  Computers are getting better because we can make smaller parts.  For example, a flash drive is made of a plastic disk with a magnetic head, and a memory chip.  The disk and the head are made of plastic.  The memory chip is made of metal.  The disk and head are getting smaller, and the metal is getting denser.  The chip is getting denser too.  It\u2019s hard to make a smaller disk or head, because it\u2019s hard to make a smaller plastic disk or head.  But it\u2019", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking, can you explain it a bit more?", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow.

How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: I think it\u2019s because the saline solution is not pure water.  It contains a small amount of salt, and that\u2019s what you taste.  The taste is usually described as \u201csalty\u201d.", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: OK, I\u2019ll start with a little background.

But maybe we can explore what \u201cliberal\u201d means, and how it\u2019s different from \u201cleft\u201d?  I can tell you that the word \u201cliberal\u201d means \u201cfavoring individual liberty and freedom\u201d and \u201chaving or showing a generous or tolerant spirit.\u201d  And the word \u201cleft\u201d means \u201cof, relating to, or being a member of the political left.\u201d  So, what are you asking about?

I can tell you that when you are tired, your brain is not as active, and you may feel more tired than you did when you were rested.  This means that your brain is not able to make you feel as alert and awake as it did when you were rested.  This can cause you to feel sleepy.  I\u2019m not sure if this is the same thing you mean by \u201crub our eyes\u201d, but I can tell you that when you feel sleepy, your brain sends signals to your mus", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: I don't know the answer to that question, but I'm happy to try to find out for you.

I'm sorry you're upset about this, but I think it's important to be realistic about how illnesses are portrayed in fiction.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s because there are a lot of people working on hold music, and it\u2019s difficult to get a lot of people to agree on a single song.  So instead, they often play a pre-recorded \u201cmix\u201d of a bunch of different songs, which makes it sound like it was recorded in a small room.  Also, the songs tend to be much shorter than songs that you hear on the radio, so it\u2019s difficult to hear the difference between them.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think that\u2019s a really good question, and I\u2019m not sure what the answer is.  There are many different countries and groups in the Middle East, and different cultures and different religions.  Some of these are very different from our own, and have a different set of beliefs and values.  Some of them have a long history of conflict with each other.  The West has long been involved in the Middle East, and has supported many different groups in the region.  This has sometimes caused conflict with other groups in the region.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a good question!  The short answer is that sugar is bad for you because it is high in calories and low in nutritional value.  It is also not necessary for the body to function, and can contribute to the development of obesity and diabetes.", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week. However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure about why this is the case in the US, but in the UK they do often have more than one talk show a week.  For example, the BBC has a \u201clate night talk show\u201d on Thursday nights, and a \u201cmid-morning talk show\u201d on Monday mornings.

I think it\u2019s because the most popular reddit posts tend to be the ones that are most popular with the most people.  I\u2019m not sure how it works, but I think it\u2019s sort of like the most popular posts are those that are shared a lot with people who are already on reddit.  I think it\u2019s because people who are already on reddit are more likely to share a post that is interesting and popular with them, because that\u2019s what they", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think that would depend on the situation.  If the two pieces are made out of different materials, and they\u2019re both solid, then I think the two pieces would both break, because the one that\u2019s trying to break through the other one would be weaker.  But if the pieces are made out of the same material, and they\u2019re both solid, then I think the piece that\u2019s trying to break through the other one would break, and the piece that\u2019s trying to break through the other one would be stronger.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the Xbox One need a brick in between the outlet plug and the console where as the PS4 doesn't?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think the Xbox One requires a brick because it has a lot more power than the PS4, so it needs more protection.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question.  Could you explain it again?", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Cannabinoid anandamide is a natural substance produced by the body, not a drug.  It\u2019s also produced naturally by plants and animals.  So it\u2019s not a drug.  It\u2019s a naturally occurring substance.  If you want to test for THC, you\u2019ll want to test for the THC in your blood.  That\u2019s a drug.  But cannabinoid anandamide is not a drug.  It\u2019s not an illegal substance.  You can\u2019t get high on cannabinoid anandamide,", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think you mean \"thick\", right?  It's more common to refer to liquids as \"thin\" or \"thicker\" than as \"viscous\".", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: I can\u2019t help you with this. I\u2019m not really a Bond fan, and I don\u2019t know much about investment banking.", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: There's a lot of different ways that computers can \"see\" and understand the world.  In this case, the computer is using the camera and the mouse to communicate.  The mouse is basically an input device that translates the movement of your hand into a signal.  The camera is also an input device, but it's a bit different.  The camera is actually recording the world around you, and then the computer uses that information to understand what's happening.  In this case, the camera is seeing what you're doing with the mouse, and the mouse is communicating that information to the computer.", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know, but it might be easier to explain with an example. Let\u2019s take the movie \u201cThe Godfather\u201d as an example, where the character Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino, has a conversation with his brother Sonny, played by James Caan.  In the scene, Michael is in a car driving to a meeting, and Sonny is in the back seat.  In the scene, Michael and Sonny have a conversation in the car, and the camera is in the car as well.  As they talk, we see Michael\u2019s face in the rear view mirror,", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, it seems that it is common in many countries, and there are some studies that show that it might be helpful to fight infections and certain diseases.  It also seems to help reduce the risk of cancer in men, although it\u2019s not clear if the benefit is large enough to make it worthwhile.  There are also other reasons for circumcision, such as religious reasons, which is why it\u2019s still common.  But it\u2019s definitely a topic of debate.", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201cfinite number of possibilities\u201d.  Can you clarify?", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry to hear that, but I don't know what you mean by \"tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant\".  Is there a specific dish or style of Chinese food that you're trying to recreate?  If so, I'd be happy to help you find a recipe that works well.  If you're just trying to make something you think tastes good, I'd be happy to help you find recipes for that too.  How about I just search for recipes for some of my favorite dishes, and you", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Do you mean why do we try to look far away?", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is water that has been treated with carbon dioxide to give it bubbles.  The bubbles are made of carbon dioxide, which is a gas.", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Americans have their own spelling system and pronunciation system, which are based on historical English, and British English is based on historical British English.  British English is still used in some parts of the world, including England, but it\u2019s not used in the United States.  Americans also use a lot of words that aren\u2019t in British English, such as \u201clunch\u201d and \u201cdessert\u201d, and we use many words that aren\u2019t in British English, such as \u201chospital\u201d and \u201ctelephone\u201d.", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If you have a shower head that is adjustable, you can change the flow rate by pushing down on the nozzle.", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014. What has happened during the last 12 months? Is the situation better or worse?\n\nAssistant: I think the situation has gotten worse.  ISIS has gained control of some territory in Iraq, including the city of Mosul.  They have also captured some of the oil fields in Iraq, which has made them richer.  The situation has also gotten worse because of the increase in the number of refugees from Syria, who are fleeing the civil war in Syria.  The refugees are mostly in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq.  In Turkey, for example, the number of refugees has increased from 200,000 to 1.", "\n\nHuman: How does having a record label help bands, and how would an indie label differ from a major label?\n\nI've searched this many times but have yet to get a clear answer. anyone have a simple explanation that could be a little more clear?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I can give you a simple explanation, but I can try to explain the basics.", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A train can pull much more weight than a car can.  There are a few reasons for this:\n\n1.  A train is much more stable than a car.  A train has a much longer wheelbase, and thus it is much more stable than a car.  This makes it much easier for a train to pull a heavier load.  If a train\u2019s stability were the same as a car, then a train would have a much smaller weight limit.\n\n2.  A train is much more powerful than a car.  A train can have much more power than a car, and this is", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: You can\u2019t really use a modern reference for these ancient texts, since they\u2019re all in a different language. For example, the hieroglyphics on the Rosetta Stone are all in an ancient Egyptian language. But you could use the Rosetta Stone to help translate the hieroglyphics.", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Ah, I see.  It\u2019s true that wet things do have a stronger smell than dry things, but I\u2019m not sure if I can explain it fully.  I can tell you that it\u2019s because when a thing is wet, it releases more of the compounds that produce its smell.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator used by scientists to study the fundamental building blocks of matter.  Scientists hope to find evidence of new particles that would help us understand the universe.  One way to study particles is to take them apart and study their pieces.  The LHC is a machine that can do this, and scientists hope that it will help us understand the fundamental building blocks of matter.", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Great question! It\u2019s really important to understand the political spectrum, since it can be confusing and there are so many different political parties. I\u2019d love to tell you more about the political spectrum and why it\u2019s important to understand the differences between the right and left political parties.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I understand your question.  I think you\u2019re asking about relativity, and I don\u2019t have enough knowledge to answer that.  But if you\u2019re just asking about the general idea of time passing differently in different locations, I can help with that.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It was a combination of the history of the measurement, and the measurement of the meter itself.  The first meter was defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole, but that was later changed to one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along the International Meridian.  The length of the meter was measured using the meter bar, which was the bar with a meter mark.  Since then, the meter bar has been replaced by the meter stick, which is a wooden stick with a meter mark.  And now we can", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a lot of different factors that could be involved here.  One possibility is that the pain you\u2019re feeling is the result of your brain not being able to communicate with your nerves.  Another possibility is that you\u2019re suffering from a condition called \u201cphantom pain\u201d.  But I don\u2019t know what the specific factors are in your case, so I can\u2019t say for sure.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The \u201c9th planet\u201d is actually a theoretical planet that is thought to be much larger than all the other planets in the Solar System.  The \u201c9th planet\u201d is just a name, but it\u2019s not the name of a planet.  Scientists have not confirmed its existence.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I understand what you\u2019re asking.  Can you explain?", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Lemons and limes are both edible, but they are also both toxic to humans.  They are also both native to the Mediterranean, which is the same area where humans first domesticated grains.  The theory is that the domestication of grains was the first step in the transition from hunting and gathering to farming.  The domestication of grains was followed by the domestication of other plants, including fruit, and then by the domestication of animals.  It is possible that the toxicity of lemons and limes was the result of the domestication of fruit, which was", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure if this is exactly what you\u2019re asking for, but here are a few things about product placement:", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: What I can tell you is that Word is actually a Microsoft Office product, and the browser is a Google Chrome product.  I\u2019m not sure if the browser is slowing down the exporting of the link, or if it\u2019s Word.  I\u2019ll ask around and see if anyone knows.  Are you sure you want to continue this conversation?", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s great!  I\u2019m glad to hear it.  I\u2019ll update the post on the Q&A page.  Do you have any questions about horses?", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The Cyprus conflict is one of the longest and most complicated international disputes in recent history.  The conflict is about a long-running dispute between the Republic of Cyprus, the Greek Cypriots, and the Turkish Cypriots over the island of Cyprus.\n\nThe conflict has been going on for a long time.  The Republic of Cyprus is the only nation in the world that is recognized by the UN as a fully sovereign nation, but in reality, the Turkish Cypriot community is the only community that is recognized by the United Nations as a fully sover", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not an anthropologist, but I can offer some thoughts.  This is a big topic in archaeology, and it\u2019s a bit difficult to talk about it in a short space.  But I\u2019ll try to summarize the main points:", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The sexes of animals are determined by a process called \u201csex determination\u201d, which is very different from how humans are sexed.  In humans, the sex of a fetus is determined by the chromosomes of the parents.  In animals, it is determined by the genes on the Y chromosome, and the sex of a fetus is determined by the genes on the X chromosome.  The genes on the Y chromosome are called the \u201csex-determining genes\u201d, or SDGs.  The genes on the X chromosome are called the \u201c", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: I think you\u2019re asking whether there\u2019s a limit to the amount of data you can send over the internet.  In terms of bandwidth, you\u2019re right that it\u2019s measured in bits per second.  But there\u2019s a lot more to it than that.\n\nI\u2019ll answer your question by giving an example.  Let\u2019s say you want to send a file to your friend on the other side of the planet.  The file is 1 GB in size, and it\u2019s going to take about 1 minute to send.  In the case of a file that large, you", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: They used to use the sun as a timer.  They would look at the sun and estimate when it would be at a certain point in the sky, and then go to sleep at that point.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: I think the simplest way to think about this is that a coin flip is a random event, and there is no reason to assume it is independent from previous coin flips.  For example, if we flip a coin 1000 times, we might expect to get 500 heads and 500 tails, but if we flip the same coin a million times, we might get 500,000 heads and 500,000 tails, and there is no reason to assume the next flip is independent from the previous ones.  It", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun used a light emitting diode to illuminate the screen. The light gun itself was a mechanical device that could move in different directions. The NES console would detect the movement of the light gun and translate it into the movement of a cursor on the screen. The light gun also had a laser pointer that could be used to indicate the location of the cursor.", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: You might be interested in reading this article about how the US government has been deporting immigrants without records of where they live, family, etc.", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think I know what you\u2019re asking, and I can try to explain it.  If you divide 0 by 0, the result is 0.  But if you take 0% of 0, you get 0.  And if you take 0% of 0, you get 0.  And if you take 0% of 0, you get 0.  And if you take 0% of 0, you get 0.

[USA]\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201cignore medical bills\u201d.  Are you talking about not paying them?  If so, I can tell you that medical bills are not something you ignore.  You have to pay them.  Otherwise, you\u2019ll be sued for the money you owe, and you\u2019ll end up paying more.  You\u2019ll also be reported to the credit bureaus, which will hurt your credit.  If you can\u2019t pay the bill, you can work out a payment plan with the hospital or doctor.  You can also get a loan to pay", "\n\nHuman: If I smoke pot, and a week later get in a car accident where someone dies, will i go to prison?\n\nI know whenever someone is seriously injured or killed in a car accident, both drivers blood are taken to check for intoxication.  Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: What about if the person is driving high?  Would that make it your fault?", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: Well, I think the expression \u201cone another\u201d is derived from the Latin phrase \u201calter homo\u201d, which literally means \u201canother man\u201d, but is used to refer to a group of people. For example, a group of people might say that they\u2019re \u201cone another\u201d, because they\u2019re all \u201cmen\u201d (which is a gender, not a species), and they\u2019re all \u201cthe same\u201d.", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure, but I can tell you that the plastic bolts and wing nuts are a very popular feature in the toilet seat industry.  I can also tell you that there are lots of reasons that metal toilet seat bolts and wing nuts are not used.  One reason is that they are not as easy to install, and another reason is that they might cause a very small amount of damage to the toilet seat.  If you want to know more about toilet seat bolts and wing nuts, you can read more about them here: https://www.to", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: Are you talking about the process of growing up, or the experience of growing up?", "\n\nHuman: If there's being such serious human rights violations goiing on in Qatar, and FIFA aren't doing anything about it, then how come none of the world governments or the UN are putting pressure on something to be done?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think it would be a mistake to expect the UN or the world governments to take action on the issue of Qatar\u2019s human rights abuses. The UN is an intergovernmental organization that is only able to take action when there is a consensus among the member governments. In this case, the member governments have not expressed a consensus on the issue of Qatar\u2019s human rights abuses.", "\n\nHuman: Sure Deposit\n\nI am being told that, despite having deposit in the name, it's just an unrelated fee.  I'm having trouble finding information on sure deposit, it seems like I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nAssistant: Sure Deposit is a fee that some banks charge to deposit checks, which is called \u201cclearing.\u201d  The fee varies, but is usually about $10 or less, depending on the bank.  It\u2019s usually charged when the check is deposited in person at a bank, or when the check is sent via mail, and the bank has to go through a process of clearing the check.", "\n\nHuman: If viruses such as Ebola have no cure, how come some people recover from the disease?\n\nHow come the virus doesn't keep multiplying until it kills the person?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a bit complicated. Ebola is a virus, and viruses are very small and fragile. So when a person is infected, the virus needs to be able to multiply in order to infect other cells. But Ebola is also very fragile, so it can\u2019t just keep multiplying. Instead, it needs a host to multiply.\n\nIn order to infect other cells, the virus must take over the machinery of a cell. It needs to do this by tricking the cell into letting it in. To do this, the virus must make a protein that looks like", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The way I see it, there are two main factors in this situation: 1) There\u2019s a physiological reason why it\u2019s hard to wake up in the morning. 2) There are psychological reasons why it\u2019s hard to wake up in the morning.

Why?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a bit of a complex question, so I\u2019ll try to simplify it for you. Vitamin A is actually a group of compounds, one of which is called retinol. Vitamin B is a group of compounds, one of which is called thiamin. Vitamin C is ascorbic acid. Vitamin D is actually a group of compounds, one of which is called cholecalciferol. Vitamin E is actually a group of compounds, one of which is called alpha-tocopherol.

One factor is that your bowels may be more sensitive to foods you eat, or medications you take.  A second factor is that the consistency of the stool can change when you eat different foods, or when you drink different amounts of water.  A third factor is that the consistency of the stool can change when you eat different foods, or when you drink different amounts of water.  A fourth factor is that the consistency of the stool can change when you eat different foods, or when you drink", "\n\nHuman: What Is the Chomsky Grammar Heirarchy and How Does It Work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are several different levels of grammar.\n\nThe first is the basic level of grammar, which is the rules for combining words and phrases into sentences.  For example, the rule that says that a sentence must end with a period is a basic rule of grammar.  This is the level of grammar that most people think of when they think of grammar.\n\nThe next level is the level of syntax.  This is the level of grammar that describes the structure of sentences.  For example, the word \u201cthe\u201d is the subject of the sentence \u201cThe dog is a good dog\u201d.  This is the level of grammar", "\n\nHuman: why almost every japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children\n\nI have just noticed this trend tbh and i never wondered why this was. It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: I think you\u2019re on to something here.  I don\u2019t have any hard data, but I think it\u2019s more likely that anime is targeted at children and teens, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so common.  It\u2019s not a requirement, but it\u2019s probably more common because it\u2019s easier to sell anime to kids and teens than to adults.  And it\u2019s easier to get an anime to a kid or teen if it\u2019s marketed as a child or teen.  I think that\u2019s why most anime is target", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The hibernation process is actually quite complicated.  It involves a lot of different processes, and I\u2019m not really familiar with the details.  But I can tell you that hibernation is a very different process than sleep.  Hibernation is a process of physically reducing metabolism, and sleep is a process of physically reducing activity in the brain.  I\u2019m not really sure if I\u2019m explaining this correctly, but that\u2019s my understanding of the difference.", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The most difficult thing to do is to speak a language. It\u2019s the most natural thing to do. But it\u2019s also the most difficult thing to do.", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure if this is the right answer, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve wondered about too. I think the braille in public places is probably just a way for blind people to know where they are and how to get around. I\u2019m not sure how they actually find the braille, but I\u2019ve heard that the braille is often printed on a different color of paper than the rest of the sign, and maybe they find the braille by touching the sign with their hand, then finding the braille with their fingers.", "\n\nHuman: What volume of water is required to drown a human?\n\nAnd a second, slightly sillier question, can someone drown swallowing only a mouthful of water?\n\nAssistant: I can\u2019t be certain, but I believe it is possible.  But I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s possible to drown with only a mouthful of water.  I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s possible to drown with a mouthful of water, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s possible to drown with only a mouthful of water.", "\n\nHuman: what is the reason for those few extra blank white pages in the back of a book?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are a lot of reasons for that, but I think the most common one is just that the publisher doesn\u2019t want to waste any space on the page.", "\n\nHuman: Meditation\n\nHow do I do it? What does it do? Does it actually work?\n\nAssistant: Meditation is a practice of focusing the mind on a single object, such as the breath, a mantra, or a visualization. The goal is to train the mind to be able to focus, and to experience a state of relaxation and calm.", "\n\nHuman: Why can insurance companies charge based on race/sex/age and not be sued for discrimination?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: They can be sued for discrimination, but it\u2019s very difficult to win.", "\n\nHuman: What is the dust on your eyes after you wake up?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re asking.", "\n\nHuman: How would a write in candidate win a national election considering that there might be and probably are other people with the exact same name?\n\nIn the context of people talking about write in candidates for this upcoming election, I was just wondering how this works.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: I think the most important thing to keep in mind is that the people who vote for a write-in candidate are the ones who decide if that person is elected or not.  If you think about it, it\u2019s a bit like a poll.  It\u2019s a way of saying \u201cI\u2019m voting for this person\u201d to the other people who are voting for that person.  So, if you think about it, it\u2019s not the person\u2019s name that\u2019s important, it\u2019s the name of the person you\u2019re voting for.", "\n\nHuman: How did people used to train pigeons to carry mail at the long distance, back in the day?\n\nI was always curious, did they have different pigeon for each address and if not, how pigeon knows whom to send? \n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure, but I think the pigeons were trained to fly from one place to another, and they were often used to carry messages.", "\n\nHuman: Why are people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war shamed instead of admired? Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a complicated question, but I can tell you some of the reasons that people who avoided serving in the war are shamed instead of admired.\n\nFirst of all, it was a bad idea, and a very unpopular one. People who avoided serving in the war were shamed because they were seen as cowards and traitors.  Many people felt that the war was a \u201cnoble cause\u201d and that everyone had to do their part to support it.  Some people who avoided serving in the war were even shamed because they were seen as \u201cunpatriotic\u201d, which was seen as an", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t think there is any way to \u201cbring one back into existence\u201d that I can think of, though there may be some more technical term that would fit the situation.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Can you explain what you\u2019re trying to get at?", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I understand your question. Could you clarify?", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: You might not be aware of this, but many people in New England have a hard time affording to purchase alcohol.  For that reason, many package stores sell their products at a discount.  They also provide services like delivery, which are more convenient for many people.  Also, the convenience of having a package store close by is a big factor.", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is an interesting question!  There are a few different reasons for this.  First, shrimp has a lot of protein in it, and that protein is what gives it its color.  When you heat up shrimp, the protein will break down into amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein.  The amino acids are what give the shrimp its brown color.  In contrast, red meat has a lot of fat in it.  When you cook red meat, the fat will break down into saturated fats, which are what gives it its brown color.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s not really trying to do anything. It\u2019s just trying to follow the rules of the programming language it\u2019s using.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I can\u2019t say for sure, but I\u2019d guess it\u2019s because fast food is convenient and it\u2019s easy to have a lot of it, so people feel like they can eat more of it than they would of other food.  I\u2019m not sure if there are any studies that have looked at this, though.", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: This is a good question, but it\u2019s a complicated one.  I can give you some background, but the full answer is probably beyond my capabilities.  The short version is that the United States has always had a tradition of political parties that are very different from each other, and this is partly because of the Constitution.  The country was founded on the principle of separation of powers, and this has meant that the President, Congress, and the Supreme Court have different responsibilities and different powers, and this has led to a situation where the parties have different priorities and different views about the proper role of government.  This", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods? Meaning, you had to live in the same block/city to connect to it? \n\n\nAssistant: BBS stands for \u201cBulletin Board System\u201d, which was a computer system for exchanging information.  It was a system where users could post messages and reply to messages from other users.  It was like a forum or a message board, but users connected to it by dialing in to a phone number.  There was also a \u201cbulletin board\u201d or \u201cbulletin board system\u201d, which was a physical bulletin board in a place like a library or a coffee shop, where people could post messages.", "\n\nHuman: What is Russell's paradox? and please explain like i am 5, i don't know anything.\n\n\n\nAssistant: You\u2019re not five, but I\u2019m going to explain Russell\u2019s paradox anyway.  Let\u2019s assume that there are five people, and we can only have one of them.  If we let each person choose a number between one and five, then there are only five numbers that can be chosen.  But if we let each person choose a number between one and five, then there are ten numbers that can be chosen.  And if we let each person choose a number between one and five, then there are a million numbers that can be chosen.  And if we let each person choose a number between", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: I've read some articles that talk about it, but I'm not an expert on the subject.  I think the Wikipedia article might be a good place to start, though.", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: The side effects of prescription drugs are listed in the package insert.  For example, in the insert for the antidepressant Cymbalta, it lists side effects that include \u201cdepression, anxiety, insomnia, and nausea.\u201d  This means that some people taking this drug may experience depression, anxiety, insomnia, and nausea.  I don\u2019t know why this happens, but I can look at the package insert to see if it explains the mechanism for this.", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear? Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a good question. The water in oceans, lakes and rivers is usually blue, green, or brown.  It\u2019s not actually clear, it\u2019s turbid.  But it\u2019s clear enough that we can see the bottom, and it\u2019s also clear enough that we can see all the creatures living in it.  The color of the water depends on the amount of organic and inorganic matter, and on the presence of light.  In oceans, it\u2019s mostly the organic matter that makes the water turbid.  In rivers and lakes,", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know much about this, but I think it has something to do with the color space.", "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between 32 and 64bit computer systems, and why aren't there, say 128bit systems.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In computer architecture, a bit is a basic unit of information.  A bit is a unit of storage for a single bit of information.  A bit is always either a 1 or a 0.  A byte is a unit of storage for eight bits.  A byte is a unit of storage for one character of information.  A 32-bit system has a byte for each bit.  A 64-bit system has a byte for each bit.  A 128-bit system has a byte for each bit.  You can use this to count how many bits are in a byte", "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a very specific case, and I\u2019d like to know more about it. Do you have any details?", "\n\nHuman: How will new gun laws prevent mass shootings?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I am afraid I am not able to answer that question, but I can tell you that the United States has a long history of gun violence, and the most recent mass shooting in the United States was the Las Vegas shooting, which resulted in the deaths of 58 people and the injuries of 546 people.  I do not know what laws you are referring to, but I can tell you that in 2012, 33,636 people were killed by firearms, and in 2015, 36,247 people were killed by fire", "\n\nHuman: Why do banks offer interest? What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Banks offer interest because they need to pay back the money they\u2019ve borrowed from the people who lent it to them, and the interest rate they need to pay back to their lenders is higher than the interest rate they can earn on the money they\u2019ve borrowed from their customers.", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think there are a few different ways to answer this question.  First, there are some obvious patterns of inequality that we can observe in the data.  For example, the top 1% of earners in the US have seen their share of the national income grow from 10% to 20% since the 1970s.  That\u2019s pretty dramatic.  However, if we look at other countries that have experienced similar income growth over the same time period, it turns out that the US is not particularly unusual in this respect.  For example, the top 1% of ear", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge? If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: That's a great question.  I'm not sure if I have an answer for you, but I do know that it's a sign to prevent accidents, not to prevent people from reading the sign.  You might be able to find some information on the internet about it.  For example, here's a link to the Wikipedia article on overpasses.  It's probably a good idea to read the whole article, but I'm going to quote a few parts here:\n\n\"The design of an overpass is a trade-off between the safety of drivers and pedestrians", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly. I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: I think it was because the blast of the firework was so strong it would have shattered his skull, which would have instantly killed him.", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: The reason is that the train engine is more efficient at making sound in the cold weather.  The engine\u2019s sound is mostly due to the airflow through the engine\u2019s cylinders.  The sound is louder because the air is colder and denser, and therefore it is traveling faster and making more sound.  This is why the sound of a train engine is louder in cold weather.", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: Do you have any evidence for this?", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s probably because their singing voice is a different part of their body than their speaking voice.  For example, if you had a voice that you could speak with, but you couldn\u2019t speak with your nose, then you\u2019d sound different when you spoke than if you spoke with your nose.  Maybe it\u2019s also because when people sing they\u2019re using a different part of their body than when they talk, and that\u2019s why they sound different.  Or maybe it\u2019s just because their singing voice sounds different than their speaking voice.  I don\u2019t know.", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water vapour is a gas, not a solid.  A gas is a substance that is made up of molecules that are not held together by strong bonds.  This means that it can move freely in the air.  So when a cloud is formed, it is made up of many tiny droplets of water.  These droplets are held together by the air around them, which is made up of air molecules.  As the cloud moves through the air, the droplets are pulled apart by the wind.  This allows them to move freely through the air, and the shape of the", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d use the word \u201cseem\u201d in that way.  But there are some reasons why animals with larger bodies tend to live longer.  The larger the animal, the slower it is.  Larger animals have a longer time to reproduce, and more time to raise their offspring.  So, it\u2019s not so much that the animals are living shorter lives, it\u2019s that they have shorter reproductive periods.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The word \u201cmom\u201d is a short form of the word \u201cmother\u201d, and the word \u201cdad\u201d is a short form of the word \u201cfather\u201d.  We say \u201cmom\u201d and \u201cdad\u201d to refer to our parents.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Hmm, let me think about that.  I believe the term \"significant digits\" refers to the number of digits that are significant to the number, in other words, the digits that are used in the calculation, or that are meaningful for the calculation.  So if you said that 22.3 + 3.45 = 25.75, then the number 25.75 is significant, because it's the result of the calculation, and therefore it's meaningful to you.  However, if you said that 22.3 + 3.4", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Sure, they do. But the liver is responsible for storing bile, which is used to break down fats. It also plays a role in breaking down proteins, but you\u2019re right that it\u2019s not the primary factor.", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s the sound of the tube turning off.  It\u2019s a high pitched whine.  There are a few different sounds that happen when you turn on the TV.  The first one is a high pitched whine.  The second one is a hiss, like the sound of a vacuum cleaner.  The third one is a \u201cbang\u201d sound.  The fourth one is the sound of the TV turning off.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries have a finite amount of energy stored inside them, and they will eventually run out of that energy.  There are a few reasons that batteries might fail:", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: Kids love spinning in circles because it feels good.  It feels like they are flying, and makes them feel like they are in control of their body and their environment.  This is why some kids spin in circles when they are upset or sad.  They are trying to make themselves feel better by controlling their environment, and by spinning in circles they are trying to take control of their own body.  They are trying to feel better by doing something that makes them feel like they are in control of their own body.", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Big Bang Theory is an idea that the universe started from a tiny, extremely dense, and extremely hot \u201csingularity\u201d, that expanded and cooled to form the universe.  It\u2019s a hypothesis that has been well-supported by data, but it\u2019s still only a hypothesis, and not a theory.", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I can count beats and bars for you.  I will use a regular human beat, which is a quarter note, and I will count in eighth notes.  I can also count in sixteenth notes.", "\n\nHuman: The Jerry Springer Show\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Can you say more about what you want to know?", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: Well, it\u2019s a question of perspective.  A person might find a lion cub cute because it reminds them of a cute kitten.  A person might find a snake cute because it\u2019s really colorful and has a cute little face.  And so on.", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are two reasons for this.  One is that the Ethernet standard uses a different technology than the Internet standard, so that is why there is a separate protocol and a separate set of rules for the two.  The other reason is that the Internet standard is more powerful and more complex, so that is why Ethernet is simpler.", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a great question! Let me explain the basics of how vision works.", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The causes of poverty are complex and there are many factors, but here are a few of the main ones.", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: Hm, it depends on the government.  The US government, for example, has a private network called the \u201cGSANet\u201d which is used for internal government communications.  This network is separate from the internet, and is not accessible to the public.  It\u2019s not clear why the US government is using the internet for these purposes, though.  The US government also has a system called \u201cSentinel\u201d which is used to monitor computer network traffic and can detect potential cyber threats.  These systems are used for monitoring and security purposes, and are not used for general public access.  The US", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: I can explain this in two ways.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s because the water is a liquid, and the water molecules are able to move around and \u201cstick\u201d to the skin.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The moon is about 384,400 km (238,855 miles) from Earth.  It\u2019s hard to see objects that far away, even with our best telescopes.  For example, the Hubble Space Telescope can see objects about 12,000 light years away, which is about 150 times farther than the moon.  Also, the Hubble Space Telescope can only see light from the objects it observes, so it can\u2019t see anything on the moon.  The moon doesn\u2019t have enough light to be", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Dehydration is when you lose water from your body. So if you drink a liquid that has water in it, you\u2019ll lose water from your body.

I will probably have to give up and just continue to disagree with the explanations, but I'm hoping someone might be able to help me understand.\n\n\nAssistant: The Monty Hall Paradox/Problem\n\nThe Monty Hall Paradox/Problem is a problem in probability theory that was introduced by the mathematician and game show host Monty Hall, who hosted Let\u2019s Make a Deal. The paradox is that the host can increase his chances of winning the game by switching the door of the person who has the prize behind it. This seems to be counterintuitive.\n\nThe Monty Hall paradox/problem is a variant of the more general Three Prisoners Problem.\n\nYou are given a choice of three doors with a", "\n\nHuman: when cannabis was still illegal in the US, how did high profile smokers e.g. Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogen etc. Not get charged for possesion?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hi", "\n\nHuman: How can websites track you based on your monitor size?\n\nWhenever I try to use Tor in full screen, a message pops up that says, \"Maximizing tor Browser can allow websites to determine your monitor size, which can be used to track you.

Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It might be possible to do this with a single machine, but it\u2019s not very efficient.  A washer is a large box that holds water and detergent, and it spins around on a motor.  This makes it very efficient at washing the clothes, but it\u2019s less efficient at drying the clothes.  A dryer is a large box that holds hot air, and it spins around on a motor.  This makes it very efficient at drying the clothes, but it\u2019s less efficient at washing the clothes.

The way that heat is transmitted from one body part to another is through a process called conduction.  Heat is transmitted by the movement of molecules, which are made up of atoms.  When you touch your skin, you are touching the molecules, which are moving.  When you touch another person\u2019s skin, you are touching the molecules, which are moving.

The diaphragm is a large muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen.  The diaphragm is also responsible for our breathing.  When we cough, the diaphragm contracts to force the air out of our lungs.  When the diaphragm contracts, it pushes on the stomach muscles and they contract as well.
