This lag is due to the system\u2019s memory, which stores information about its past. Hysteresis causes the system to respond slowly to changes in its input.\n\nHysteresis is also called a \u201clag,\u201d because the system\u2019s response to a change in its input is delayed.\n\nFor example, when you try to put your hand on a hot stove, you\u2019", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for asking!\n\nIntel and AMD are two of the most popular chip manufacturers in the world. They both have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Intel processors are generally more energy efficient, but AMD processors are usually more powerful.\n\nIntel has more experience in producing processors and is usually more reliable. It is also more well-known and has more support.\n\nAMD has a larger number of processors in its lineup, and they usually have higher clock speeds.

It does this because chlorophyll is a pigment that is responsible for photosynthesis in plants. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use light energy to make food. This process is done by a series of chemical reactions. Chlorophyll is a green pigment that absorbs light energy, and then transfers it to other molecules in the plant. This allows the plant to make food.

It is produced in the brain and is released when the body experiences a stressful situation, such as exercise.  It is believed to play a role in the body's response to stress.  It is also believed to play a role in the feeling of euphoria that some people experience after exercise, which is why runners often feel \"high\" after a run.

The mouse is connected to the computer by a cord or a wireless connection. The computer uses the information from the mouse to tell where the mouse is on the screen. It then moves the cursor on the screen to that location. The mouse has a small ball or other device that moves to give the computer information about where the mouse is on the surface. This is called a mouse sensor.\n\nA monitor is a screen that shows you what the computer is doing.

Mirrors are often used to make a scene look bigger than it is. For example, in a scene where a character is looking out a window, the director may decide to put a mirror behind the character, and then use a camera shot looking through the mirror to see the scene. This makes the scene look bigger and more interesting. A mirror can also be used to help the actor look good.

Trains pull so much weight because they are pulling a lot of cars. Each train car has a certain amount of weight that it can pull. The limit of how much weight a train can pull is called the maximum load. The maximum load depends on the train and the tracks. The maximum load is the amount of weight that the train can pull without causing damage to the tracks or the train.

How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.\n\nThe amount of information that can be sent over a connection is limited by the bandwidth of the connection, which is the maximum amount of information that can be sent over a connection per second. The larger the bandwidth, the more information that can be sent per second.\n\nBandwidth is measured in bits per second (bps).
