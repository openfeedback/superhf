How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The box office revenue is split between the distributor and the theater, so the theater gets about half and the distributor gets the other half.  The distributor will make a profit if the movie costs less than it grosses.  The distributor will lose money if it costs more than it grosses.  The movie cost a lot to make, so the distributor needs to make a lot of money to make back the cost of the movie.  This is why the cast will get a relatively small amount of money.  The actors are paid for their performance, not for the movie's success.", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor.
