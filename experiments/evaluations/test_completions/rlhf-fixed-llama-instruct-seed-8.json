Newly appointed head of Xbox is Stephen Elop of Nokia. How did he get a 15 million euro bonus from Nokia when the company lost 15 billion under his control?\n\nAccording his wiki \" During the 3 years Elop was Nokia CEO, Nokia revenues fell 40%, Nokia profits fell 95%, Nokia market share collapsed in smartphones from 34% to 3.4%, Nokia's credit rating went from A to junk, Nokia's share price dropped 60% in value and Nokia's market capitalization lost 13 Billion dollars in value. The Financial Times calculated that Nokia shareholders ended up paying Elop a bonus of 1 million Euros for every 1.5 billion in market capital that Elop was able to destroy while Nokia CEO.\"\n\nI must have zero understanding of how bonuses are supposed to work. This guy is one example, but there are many others. \n\nAssistant: I know how bonuses are supposed to work. However, in some cases, such as the one you have described, the bonus is not related to a specific action but rather to the overall performance of the company. In this case, the bonus is not related to how much the company is worth, but how well it is performing. Since Nokia was not performing well, the bonus was not as high. Therefore, if the company performs well, the bonus will be higher, even if the company is worth less.

Rubbing our eyes is not a way to relieve pressure from tired eyes.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The CPUs you have listed are all different. The AMD ones are six-core, the Intel ones are eight-core. The AMD ones are cheaper because they have fewer cores and are cheaper to make, the Intel ones are more expensive because they have more cores and are more expensive to make. The Intel CPUs have faster clock speeds and more cores, so they're better for more things, but the AMD ones are still pretty good and will do everything you'd want a CPU to do. They're both good CPUs for the price. They're just different sizes.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Eyelids twitching when you are not getting enough sleep is due to the body being in a state of sleep deprivation. This causes the eye to over-exert itself to remain open, so it becomes tired. This is also why people tend to rub their eyes when they are sleepy. Another reason why people may twitch their eyelids when they are not getting enough sleep is that the eyes are not used to the lack of sleep. The eye muscles are used to being open for a long time, so when the eyelids are kept closed, they are trying to stay awake", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: If they have symptoms, they probably aren't end-stage yet. But yes, most people with terminal end-stage cancer will eventually get symptoms, but those are generally quite vague and don't usually lead to immediate death. People with terminal end-stage cancer are usually able to live for months or years after diagnosis. Some people with terminal end-stage cancer will die from cancer within weeks, but that's a small percentage.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: If you call a company and you hear a recorded message that says, \"Thank you for calling ABC Company, your call is important to us. Please stay on the line, your wait time is now x minutes. We'll be with you shortly. Please listen to the following options.\" then the music you hear is usually compressed and canned. This is because the company has a recording of the music on a loop, which means it plays over and over again, and the music you hear is actually the compressed version of the original recording. If you're on hold for a long time, you may also hear a recorded", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The United States and other Western countries have provided military support to the Middle East for decades. The United States has supported the creation of Israel and has been a staunch supporter of Israel. The United States has also provided military support to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. These countries have used their military support to control their own borders and their own domestic policies. They have also used their military support to control other countries in the region. The United States and other Western countries have also provided military support to Iran, Iraq, and other countries in the region. These countries have used their military support", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: \"It has a lot of calories\" is a bad reason to avoid sugar.  It's a great reason to avoid eating too much of any food that has lots of calories, like sugar, fats, or carbs.  In general, you should avoid eating too many calories because it makes it harder to lose weight.  But if you eat too many calories because of the sugar, you're still better off than eating too many calories from fat, because sugar has more sugar and less fat than fat does fat.  This is because sugar has 4 calories per gram,", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

The water soluble THC is metabolized quickly, while the fat soluble THC is metabolized slowly. Therefore, THC in cannabinoid anandamide would not cause you", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The flow of a liquid is measured by its viscosity, which is a property that quantifies how much the liquid resists the flow of other liquids. A liquid that flows easily is considered less viscous than a liquid that flows less easily. The viscosity of a liquid depends on the temperature of the liquid. As a liquid cools, the flow of the liquid becomes less viscous. A liquid that is very viscous at room temperature is not considered a liquid at all. The viscosity of a liquid is also dependent on the molecular structure of the liquid. Liquids with smaller mole", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre's plan was to destroy the Skyfleet stocks in order to make it appear that the bomb was an act of terrorism, not a stock market manipulation. Skyfleet was about to release a new fleet of planes which would have made Le Chiffre's airline obsolete. Le Chiffre would then short the stock, drive the price down, and then buy it back at a cheaper price. He could then make billions of dollars, while Skyfleet would go bankrupt. Le Chiffre then would be able to gain control of Sky", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: The mouse and monitor communicate through the mouse. The mouse translates the mouse's motion into a message that the computer understands, which it then sends to the monitor. The mouse itself does not have a \"form\" because it is not a physical object. The mouse is a device that translates motion into a message that the computer understands. The mouse is not the message. The message is what the mouse sends to the computer. The mouse is simply a tool that translates mouse motion into a message that the computer can understand. The mouse does not have a \"form\" because it is not a physical object.

But the number of possible states of Go is infinite, because the game is played on a 21x21 grid, and each piece has an infinite number of possible positions on the grid. This is because there are an infinite number of possible locations for each piece in the board, and each of these locations can be occupied by an infinite number of pieces. For example, there are an infinite number of positions on the board where a stone can be placed, and an infinite number of stones that can be", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: Cooking from scratch is very different from cooking with prepared ingredients.  Cooking from scratch is a lot of trial and error because you need to figure out the best way to use the ingredients.  You will also need to find out how long things need to cook.  Most people are not that good at guessing.  Cooking with prepared ingredients is a lot easier.  You just follow the directions on the package.  There is very little trial and error.  You will still need to learn how to use the ingredients.  For example, you might need to learn how to cook", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Light coming from distant objects is spread out in all directions. This causes the light that reaches your eye to be dim and spread out. The pupil of the eye becomes larger to let in more light, which makes the image appear brighter. However, it also spreads out the light, making it appear blurry. When you are trying to see far away, your eyes are trying to see dim light and the pupils become larger to let in more light. The blurry image from the spread out light makes you squint. When you are looking at something close by, your eyes are trying to see bright light and", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is made by dissolving a large amount of carbon dioxide into a large amount of water. The carbon dioxide dissolves when the water is heated to a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius. The solution is then cooled to 0 degrees Celsius and the carbon dioxide is released as the water is poured into a container. The carbon dioxide is also released when the water is shaken or stirred. The carbon dioxide makes the water fizz. Carbonated water is also known as soda water, club soda", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many words in the English language that are spelled the same, but have different pronunciations. These words are called homonyms. Homonyms are words that have the same spelling and different pronunciation. A few examples of homonyms are: \"bake\" (to cook something in an oven) and \"bake\" (to make something out of dough). \"Bake\" (to cook something in an oven) is spelled with \"a\" at the end, and \"bake\" (to make something out of dough) is spelled with \"e\"", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The water in the shower is a mixture of water from the shower head and water from the tap. The amount of water from the shower head that is heated depends on the temperature of the water from the tap. If the water from the tap is hotter, the shower water will be warmer. If the water from the tap is colder, the shower water will be colder. The amount of water from the tap that is heated depends on how much water is from the shower head and how much is from the tap. If the shower is turned on for a short time, the amount", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014. What has happened during the last 12 months? Is the situation better or worse?\n\nAssistant: ISIS is the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which is a militant group active in Iraq and Syria. ISIS was established in 2014 after the group gained control over large areas of land in Iraq and Syria. It has since been waging a campaign to establish an Islamic state in the Levant and to establish a caliphate in the region. ISIS has been described by the United Nations and other groups as a terrorist organization due to its use of violence and other terrorist actions to pursue its goals. The group is also known", "\n\nHuman: How does having a record label help bands, and how would an indie label differ from a major label?\n\nI've searched this many times but have yet to get a clear answer. anyone have a simple explanation that could be a little more clear?\n\nAssistant: How does having a record label help bands, and how would an indie label differ from a major label?\n\nA record label is a company that helps bands get their music out to the public.  They are responsible for getting the music to radio stations, managing the band's tour schedule, and promoting the band to music publications and other media.  A major label is a company that is responsible for managing the entire recording process, including the music, the tour, and all the marketing.  This includes working with the band's management team and the artist to make sure the music is good, the", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It depends on the train. There are many different types of trains and each one can pull different amounts of cars. The amount of weight a train can pull depends on the number of cars it has, the weight of each car, and the weight of the locomotive. For example, a train with 100 cars and a weight of 1000 tons can pull 100,000 tons. It would be the same for a train with 10 cars and a weight of 100 tons. A train with 10 cars and a weight of 1000 tons can", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: These ancient materials were written in languages that are no longer spoken. Languages and dialects change over time. Since the time when these materials were written, the modern language has evolved. Ancient languages can be compared to modern languages to see if there are similarities. This process is called \"comparative linguistics\". The ancient materials are also written in different scripts and in different styles of writing. These materials can be translated by comparing them to similar materials written in the same script. These materials can also be translated by using a modern translation. If there is a modern translation of the ancient materials, then the ancient materials can be", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: A wet object has a higher surface area to volume ratio than a dry one. This means that when you touch a wet surface, you are touching more skin and hairs than when you touch a dry surface. This allows for more of the object's smell to be transferred to your hand, and thus, to your nose. Also, wet surfaces tend to be moist and sticky, which can increase the amount of smell that is transferred from the object to your hand and then to your nose.\n\nWet farts smell because of the same reason. Wet farts are a lot smellier", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest particle accelerator. It is located on the border of Switzerland and France and is operated by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The LHC is designed to accelerate and collide particles to energies beyond those previously reached. The goal of the LHC is to explore the fundamental properties of matter. This is accomplished by recreating conditions similar to those that existed in the early moments of the universe. This information will help scientists better understand the creation of the universe. In addition, the LHC will help us to", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many differences between right political parties and left political parties. The major difference between these two ideologies is that right political parties, such as the Republicans in the United States, believe in a smaller government, whereas left political parties, such as the Democrats in the United States, believe in a larger government. Right political parties also believe in capitalism, whereas left political parties believe in socialism. Right political parties believe in individualism, whereas left political parties believe in collectivism. Right political parties also believe in individual freedom, whereas left political parties believe in equality. Right political parties also believe in limited government, whereas left", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: If you travelled at the speed of light, you would be able to travel from Earth to a star system 4.3 light years away in about 1 year. The time you spent travelling at that speed would be the same as the time spent travelling at the speed of light, so the time would be 1 year.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the 19th century, the international meter was defined in terms of a particular number of wavelengths of a certain type of radiation. Since then, the meter has been defined in terms of the wavelength of a certain type of radiation, the krypton-86 atom, the speed of light in vacuum, and the Planck constant. This is called the \"International System of Units\" or \"SI\" for short.\n\nThe meter is the SI base unit for length. The metre is the SI unit of length, and one metre is defined as the distance light travel", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you are little, the nerves that transmit pain are more sensitive and your brain is still developing. When you are adult, your nerves are less sensitive and your brain has learned how to ignore pain. That's why you don't feel any pain after getting soap in your eye.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is possible because the distance between the planets is huge. In fact, we can't even see the other planets in our Solar System, but we can see the light from them. Also, the planet that they are looking for is very small and very far away. It is very difficult to find it. We have a lot of technology now, but it is still difficult. The planet is very cold and very far away, and it is very small. It is so far away that it takes a long time to get there. It is very difficult to find, but we have learned a lot about it.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Cannibalism is a behavior found in some animals, but not all animals. Some animals, like spiders, eat their mate to help them mate and reproduce. This is called sexual cannibalism. Some animals, like insects, eat their mate to avoid competition. This is called non-sexual cannibalism. Some animals eat their mate for fun. This is called predatory cannibalism. This is why some animals eat their mate. Some animals eat their mate because it is cannibalism. This is called cannibalism. Cannibal", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fruits such as lemons and limes are actually not sweet to animals, so they are not as effective at encouraging animals to carry the seeds away from the parent tree. However, the seeds of these fruits are very small and can be transported by water, wind, or animals. The small size of the seeds and the way they are dispersed makes these fruits less effective at carrying the seeds away from the parent tree. This is why they are not as effective at encouraging animals to carry the seeds away from the parent tree. However, the seeds of these fruits are very small", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: There are several ways to pay for a placement in a movie. Some companies will pay a flat fee to have their product in a movie, which is called a product placement. Others will pay a percentage of the box office, which is called a backend. A backend can be a good option if the movie is a huge hit. If the movie is a box office flop, however, the company may not earn anything. Some companies will also pay a flat fee for a product placement but will also pay a percentage of the backend. This is called a co-financing deal. A product placement in a", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: This is because each time you click on a link in Word, the Word application needs to open the link and then open the browser. This can be a long process.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: Some horses are put down because they are too sick to recover. Other horses are put down because they are no longer useful in the sport. If the horse has an injury, it may be put down because it would be too much of a burden to care for a horse that is no longer useful. Other horses may be put down because they are too old to be of use anymore. If the horse has a minor injury, it may be put down because it may need to be put down anyway if it is too old. If the horse is too old to be useful, it may be put down anyway. If the horse has a", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The question is a bit confusing. The Republic of Cyprus, which is a member of the European Union, is the country which is officially recognized as the Republic of Cyprus by the United Nations and the European Union. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is not a member of the European Union, is the country which is recognized by Turkey. The United Nations does not recognize the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, but has recognized the Republic of Cyprus. The Republic of Cyprus is recognized by the European Union and the United Nations. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is recognized by Turkey", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Children often make up the majority of the remains that are found. This is due to the fact that they are small and easier to find. In addition, they have not gone through adulthood, so the remains are less likely to be contaminated by modern practices.   \n\nAdults are also found in these remains, but they are generally more difficult to find, and more often, are contaminated by modern practices.    \n\nA lot of the remains that are found are actually the result of grave robbers, which is why so many remains are found in isolated areas.  These grave robb", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are several differences between males and females of many species, including humans and lions. Males have characteristics that help them to survive and reproduce in their environment, whereas females have characteristics that help them to reproduce and survive. For example, males have larger bodies than females because they need more energy to be able to defend and hunt their territory. Male lions have larger bodies than females because they need more energy to be able to defend and hunt their territory. Female lions have larger bodies than males because they need more energy to reproduce and hunt their territory. Female lions have larger bodies than males because", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: The amount of information that can be sent through a cable internet depends on the bandwidth of the cable. The higher the bandwidth, the more information can be sent. Cable internet uses coaxial cable, which can have a bandwidth of up to 1200 Mbps.

Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: - Blue or green water color is caused by light scattering of particles. When light travels through water, it interacts with the water molecules and other particles. The light is then scattered by the molecules and particles.
