How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be sent over a given amount of time.  The maximum bandwidth is determined by how fast the signal travels over the wire, how much data can be sent at one time, and how much data can be sent per second.  Bandwidth is measured in bits per second (bps).  There is no theoretical limit to how much information can be sent over a wire, but there is a practical limit.
