When a disc is healthy, it functions as a cushion between the vertebrae and helps absorb shock. When the disc becomes damaged or degenerates, it can cause pain.\n\nWhen", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: Exchange rates are the relative values of one currency against another. For example, if one country's currency is worth 0.75 USD, and another country's currency is worth 1.50 USD, then the former is said to have a 75% exchange rate with the latter. \n\nCurrencies are worth different amounts because they are traded for each other at different prices. For example, if you are in country A and you want to buy 100 units of country B's currency, and you are willing to pay $100 for them, then the", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hippy generation were known for their peaceful and happy lifestyle.

Chew thoroughly.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: The taste is from the chemicals that are in the IV fluid, such as dextrose (sugar) and saline (salt water).  The taste is not from the medication, which is usually dissolved in the IV fluid.  The taste is caused by the chemicals in the IV fluid, which are usually sugary or salty.", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that states that a particle's position and momentum cannot be simultaneously known with absolute precision. \n\nThe principle was first proposed by Werner Heisenberg in 1927, and it is an example of the Uncertainty Principle. \n\nThe Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely one property of a particle is known, the less precisely the other property can be known. For example, if one knows the position of a particle with a high degree of precision, then one cannot know its momentum with a high degree", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is the lag between the initial action of an object and its eventual response.\n\nHysteresis is the lag between the initial action of an object and its eventual response. This lag is a result of the object\u2019s history, its current state, and its environment. Hysteresis can be measured in time and in energy.\n\nConsider the swing of a pendulum.

However, it will not provide a long term solution to the problem.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The main difference between the two is that AMD has a slightly lower clock speed, which means that they are not as fast as the Intel CPUs. However, the AMD CPUs have more cores than the Intel ones, which means that they can handle more tasks at once. This means that AMD CPUs are better for multitasking and CPU-heavy tasks like video encoding, while the Intel CPUs are better for single-tasking and CPU-light tasks like word processing and web browsing.\n\nThe difference in price is mostly due to the fact that Intel makes the CPUs and AMD s", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's probably just your brain trying to tell you something, but scientists aren't sure what.  Most likely it's just a random twitch and has nothing to do with sleep.  Some people think that it might be caused by a lack of sleep, or a lack of sleep might make it more likely to happen.  Some people also think that it could be caused by stress, or anxiety.  We're not sure exactly what causes it.  But if you want to try and prevent it, then getting enough sleep might help.  It's also a good idea to try and relax,", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: This is a very interesting question. This is a very complex question. I will answer this question as best as I can. In the movies and books, they often portray people with terminal end-stage cancer as being symptom free until they drop dead one day. This is not realistic. In real life, people with cancer may experience various symptoms. These can include fatigue, pain, nausea, loss of appetite, difficulty swallowing, weight loss, fever, and others. These symptoms can occur at any time, and may vary in severity from person to person. If these", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hold music is often provided by a third-party service that is contracted by the company. The music is often licensed from a large library of music and is not unique to the company. \n\nSome companies, such as Verizon, do provide their own music, and the music is actually recorded by their own staff. \n\nIn addition, it is common for companies to provide recorded music to customers on hold, rather than live music. \n\nLive music would be more expensive for the company, and would also take up more bandwidth. \n\nCompanies typically want to minimize their costs,", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Middle East would be allowed to sort out its own problems without Western intervention or armaments.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar can lead to obesity if you consume too much.  It is a calorie dense food and if you consume more calories than you burn in a day you will gain weight.  Sugar has no nutritional value and should be consumed sparingly.  The best way to determine how much sugar to eat is to count the number of calories in the sugar and then divide it by 4 to determine how many teaspoons of sugar to consume per day.  A teaspoon of sugar has 4 calories so if you consume 100 calories of sugar you", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week. However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: Late-night American talk shows air five days a week because the late-night talk show format has become a staple of American television and the host of these shows are some of the most popular and highest paid television personalities in the United States.\n\nThe late-night talk show format began in 1954 when The Tonight Show debuted on NBC.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The conflict between the two groups in Cyprus has its roots in the 19th century. The Ottoman Empire ruled Cyprus until 1878. During this time, the island was a minor administrative district in the Ottoman Empire, with no significant population of its own. The Ottoman Empire was defeated in the First Balkan War of 1912-1913 and the island of Cyprus was occupied by Britain and France. The island was placed under the governance of the British Empire as a crown colony in 1914.

For example, in lions, the male lions have a mane of hair around their neck and chest. The mane is used for protection and intimidation. In females, the mane is absent because it is not necessary for protection or intimidation. The mane is also used for mating. It is used to attract females. Male lions also have larger canine teeth than females. In humans, the differences are less obvious. However, males have a more developed upper body than females.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: The bandwidth of a cable internet connection refers to the maximum amount of data that can be sent through the cable at any given time. The bandwidth is measured in bits per second (bps). Cable internet bandwidth is usually measured in Mbps (megabits per second) or Gbps (gigabits per second). The higher the number, the faster the internet connection.\n\nA cable internet connection is faster than a DSL connection because the data is sent over a coaxial cable, which is a faster medium than a phone line. However, the bandwidth of a cable connection", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Alarm clocks are a very recent invention. Before alarm clocks, people used to wake up at a certain time by using a sundial, which was a device used to measure the time of day based on the position of the Sun. Sundials were also used to determine the date, using the position of the Sun and Moon.\n\nA sundial works by casting a shadow.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: The probability of a coin flip being heads or tails is 50% each.  There is no bias towards either outcome.

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: You could be charged with manslaughter, if you were under the influence of marijuana at the time of the accident.", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: The expression \"one another\" is derived from the Latin phrase \"alter ego\". The phrase \"alter ego\" means \"another self\" and is typically used in legal contexts. For example, in a will, a person may bequeath their \"alter ego\" to a certain person. In legal terms, an \"alter ego\" is a person who acts as a representative for another person. For example, a trustee may act as an \"alter ego\" for a trust.

They do have a code of conduct, which all member countries have to agree to. However, they don't actually enforce this code of conduct. FIFA has the power to suspend a country if they are found to have broken the code of conduct, but they haven't done this in the case of Qatar. The UN is a much bigger organisation than FIFA.

However, the immune system can fight off viruses, and it does this by recognising the virus and producing antibodies to fight it. If the virus is small enough, the immune system can fight it off before it does any damage. However, if the virus is large enough, it can overwhelm the immune system and cause the body to break down. This is what happens when someone has a fever, vomits, and bleeds. It is the body's way of", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Waking up in the morning is difficult because it is hard to get out of bed and go to work.

If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is the process of entering a state of dormancy during the winter. During hibernation, the animal's heart rate, breathing, body temperature, and metabolic rate are reduced to near zero. They do not eat or drink during this time and are essentially in a coma-like state. This is to conserve energy for the winter months when food is scarce. When the spring arrives, the animal's systems are woken up and they emerge from hibernation to begin eating and reproducing. Hibernation is different from sleep because the animal is not awake", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons for this.

Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Avoiding service in the US military during the Vietnam War was viewed as a sign of moral failure. Many people who avoided service during Vietnam were shamed for it, and often called \"draft dodgers\" or \"deserters\". In fact, the Vietnam War was a controversial issue at the time, and many people were against it. Some people who were drafted during the Vietnam War were very vocal about their opposition to the war.

Some of these", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: There are multiple ways that scientists can try to bring back the Neanderthal, but none of these are likely to succeed.  It is possible that a scientist could use a Neanderthal genome and a human genome to create a Neanderthal-human hybrid, but this is very unlikely to happen, because there are many reasons why this would be impossible.  One reason is that scientists would have to find a way to make a human egg accept the Neanderthal genome, which would be very difficult to do.  Another reason is that scientists would have to find a way", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender is a person whose gender identity is different from the gender they were assigned at birth.

This is why smoking marijuana makes things", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The state of Massachusetts has a very strict system for licensing package stores. They are only allowed to be within 100 feet of a school, church, or other package store. They are also only allowed to sell beer and wine, so they are not able to sell hard liquor. This limits the competition in the industry and makes it very difficult for new package stores to open.\n\nAnother reason is that Massachusetts has a high tax on alcohol.

The tax", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The main reason that shrimp turns orange when cooked is because shrimp is cooked in the shell. The shell contains carotenoids, a type of pigment that is found in many plants and animals. Carotenoids give the shrimp its orange color. The pigment is most concentrated in the shrimp's shell, so when the shell is removed, the orange color will disappear. When meat is cooked, the outer layers of the meat are removed. The outer layers of meat are usually brown in color, and the inner layers are usually red in color.
