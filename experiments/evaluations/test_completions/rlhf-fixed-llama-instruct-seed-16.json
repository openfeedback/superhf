The rate at which these stones form varies depending on the individual, and the factors that may contribute to the formation of stones include poor diet, high-salt diets, high-sugar diets, dehydration, and certain medications. The stone that forms in the kidney is usually a crystallization of mineral deposits in the urine. The mineral crystals are", "\n\nHuman: Do eyes get tired from moving constantly during REM sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't know, but they don't have to. I'm not tired. I'm happy and I'm happy to help you, but I can't answer your question.", "\n\nHuman: Why is eye contact so important?\n\nSerious question!\n\nAssistant: Eye contact is very important to establish trust and to build rapport. The way people look at each other is a form of nonverbal communication. When you look directly into someone's eyes, it shows that you are serious and paying attention. Eye contact also helps you to\nbuild your social skills.\nIt is also important to know that eye contact is\nnot only important in your personal life, but also in your professional life. It is a critical part of\ninterviews, presentations, and business meetings. In addition, eye contact can also be a sign of respect.\nIf you are not comfortable", "\n\nHuman: With no entrance or exit ramp and no visible road obstruction, how does traffic back up for 2 miles?\n\n\n\nAssistant: No one knows. This happens at the end of the freeway, before the end of the freeway, and all the ramped intersections. It's a mystery. I heard a theory that it's caused by people getting off the freeway to take a break, then forgetting to get back on. Another theory I heard is that the freeway has a lot of traffic and", "\n\nHuman: Why was Benton Mackenzie not allowed to talk about his medical condition during his trial?\n\nTL;DR Benton Mackenzie is a terminal cancer patient in Iowa who was arrested for growing cannabis for the purpose of making CBD oil to treat his tumors.\n\nWhy couldn't he explain why he was growing the plants?\n\nDoes this not violate the sixth amendment to the US Constitution?\n\nAssistant: The court found that Benton Mackenzie was not required to", "\n\nHuman: Why can't humans consciously control certain bodily responses and functions?\n\nFor example, (if I understand correctly) if pain is a warning that something is wrong, why can't we 'tell' our brain to stop sending those signals once we realize what it is?\n\nAssistant: I don't think we can consciously stop pain. The way pain is produced in our body is through the nerve signals, and these signals are sent by our brain.", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There is no mammal photosynthesis. The sunlight causes the skin to synthesize vitamin D. The synthesis requires exposure to sunlight for a certain amount of time.\n\nThe synthesis is not direct, the skin is first exposed to sunlight and then the vitamin D precursor, a compound called cholesterol. Cholesterol is then converted into vitamin D by the skin. The vitamin D precursor is not essential for humans. It is the synthesis of vitamin D that is essential. The synthesis is in the skin.\n\nThe synthesis", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Flicker is caused by the interruption of the power to a led.  The power is interrupted by the video playback system to change the led from one color to another.  To avoid this, you need to make sure that the led is powered from the video playback system, which is not\n[removed]", "\n\nHuman: How does the box office work? For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: I think you're right. It's probably not fair that the cast gets paid, and that's probably why you're asking this question. But even though I'm sure it's not fair, it's still a part of the box office. The cast gets paid from the money the movie makes, from the box office. You're right, the box office is not a good representation of the real money that was made. But it's still a big part of the money that was made. I'm sure it's not fair, but it's still a big part of the", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: I am not a scientist, so I am going to have to answer based on my understanding of what I know about the cancer rate for livestock.", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops. If I was to cut it in half, how would it know to start growing again?\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: How do wireless phone chargers work\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The chargers use either magnetic induction or radio frequencies to charge your phone. Most modern chargers use magnetic induction. The charging pad has a coil in it. When you place your phone on the charging pad, the coil inside the charging pad generates a magnetic field. The charging coil in your phone picks up the magnetic field and converts it into an electric current. That current charges your phone.", "\n\nHuman: What are sensitive teeth? My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth are a common problem, affecting about 45% of adults. Sensitive teeth are usually due to enamel loss. Enamel loss is most common on the biting surfaces of the teeth. Your dentist has probably told you that you have no cavities, but this doesn't mean you don't have enamel loss. If you have sensitivity, you probably have enamel loss. This can be caused by several things. Toothbrushing too hard or brushing too often. Grinding or clenching your teeth. Sensitivity can also", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The point of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is to protect religious freedom in Indiana. It was allowed to get passed because of the controversy over the state's law requiring businesses to provide services to same-sex couples. The law was signed into law by then Governor of Indiana, Mike Pence. The law was", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry is a new physics theory that tries to explain the existence of all known particles in our universe. It tries to explain why there is no fundamental particle with a mass that is much smaller than the electron. In addition, it tries to explain why there are no known particles with a mass that is much larger than that of the top quark. One of the ways in which the theory tries to explain these observations is by postulating a particle called the superparticle that has a mass that is the same as the electron. This new particle is assumed to be produced when the electron decays. The theory also postul", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: I'm not a dermatologist, but I know that the palms of hands are not the same as the soles of feet.  They are made of different tissues.  I'm not sure why you have eczema there, but you may have something that you could apply there to help it.  There are creams that you can use on your hands for eczema, but you should check with your doctor to make sure they are okay to use.  You can try something like this: https://www.drugstore.com/skin-care/adult-eczema-", "\n\nHuman: What is actually happening when your heart \"aches\"?\n\nAssistant: The heart is a muscle that pumps blood to the body. When your heart is aching, it's because it's tired. It's also because you're probably really sore, too, because you've just done some exercise. The heart is a muscle that pumps blood to the body.

They have a lot of benefits, and they are inexpensive. Peanuts are a very versatile ingredient, and they are easy to add to any dish. They are also very easy to store and can last up to a year. Peanuts are usually inexpensive, and they can last a long time. They are also a good source of protein, fiber and vitamin E. They are also low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Peanuts are also a good source of monounsaturated fat", "\n\nHuman: How do compression shorts and compression tights help athletes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Compression shorts and compression tights help athletes by improving muscle recovery, reducing muscle fatigue, reducing muscle soreness, increasing performance, reducing injury risk, reducing muscle swelling, reducing muscle stiffness, reducing inflammation, reducing muscle spasms, reducing muscle strain, and reducing muscle tension.  Compression shorts and compression tights help athletes by increasing blood flow to the muscles, increasing muscle temperature, reducing muscle vibration, reducing muscle oscillation, reducing muscle oscillation, reducing muscle oscillation, and reducing mus", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens when you pull your back? I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you pull your back the muscles in the back become strained. When the muscles are strained they can't move well and the\nspinal joints don't move smoothly. This can cause pain. In the case of a strain you may be able to do some activities but the\nmuscles are still strained. If the strain is severe you may be unable to move at all. When the muscles and joints are strained you\ncan't move properly and you're more likely to re-injure the muscles. This is called reinjury. The longer", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: The value of a currency depends on how much of it is being used to trade goods and services. The value of a currency also depends on how much of it is being held for investment, and how much of it is being held as a store of wealth.\n\nThe value of a currency depends on its supply and demand. If there is a greater demand for a currency, its price will go up. This is because if there is more demand for something, there will be a higher price. If there is less demand for a currency, its price will go down. This is because if there is less demand for something, there", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Many of them had careers, some of them just worked less. A lot of the hippies didn't have money, they did what they could. Some hippies had money, but they used that money to pay for the stuff they needed, like food, shelter, and clothes. Many hippies did not have money, and they did what they could. They were also often poor, and they lived in communities where they could help each other out. Many hippies were also young, and they did not have to pay for things like insurance or rent. They could also live on their own, and", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: As you know, the Earth rotates around the sun. The sun takes about 24 hours to complete a rotation. We, the human race, are very much based on the rotation of the earth. This is why we are programmed to sleep for 24 hours. We need to sleep everyday to keep our body clock in sync with the earth's rotation. If days were longer, we would still sleep for 24 hours. The only difference would be that we would be sleeping for a longer period. We would be sleeping for 24 hours everyday.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I think it's because of a variety of factors, including Moore's law (which states that computing power will double every 18 months, and that it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future) as well as better, more efficient algorithms. In addition, it's also because we're able to build more compact, faster, more reliable components, and more efficient and energy-efficient ways of storing data (e.g. SSDs, which can store more data in the same physical area as a HDD, and which require less energy to operate). Finally, it's because", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Let's see. The first 99 is 99 digits, and the last is 99 digits. If you multiply it by 10, you will get 99 digits. If you multiply it by 100, you will get 99 digits. If you multiply it by 1000, you will get 99 digits. If you multiply it by 10000, you will get 99 digits. And so on. 10000! 99! 10000! 99! 10", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow.

How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: Because you have taste buds on the back of your tongue. Even if you do not have any taste buds in your mouth, the IV tube will still taste because the medication will still have taste. In the medication, you will still have the taste of the", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: I think the problem is that you're looking at it the wrong way. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle isn't meant to say that you can't know both momentum and position. In fact, it's saying just the opposite: you can know both momentum and position exactly! The problem is that the two are incompatible: you can't know both the momentum and the position of a particle with exact certainty, but you can know one with certainty, and the other with uncertainty.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: You're right, it's hard to explain this in a way that's understandable. But let's see if we can simplify it a little bit.\n\nHysteresis is a concept that has been around for a long time, but it's actually quite simple to understand. It's about how the current state of an object impacts how that object behaves in the future.\n\nHysteresis is commonly used in weather forecasting to describe how the current weather can impact the weather in the future. For example, if it's sunny and warm today, but there", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

The eyes are lined with a thin layer of moisture called the tear film. When we get tired, the eye's ability to produce tears is reduced, and the tear film is\nthin. The thin tear film, however, is not as good at keeping the eye surface lubricated and clean as a thicker, moisture-rich tear film is. Rubbing the eyes helps to spread the thinner tear film over the eye surface, making it more effective at keeping the eye moist and", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The AMD CPUs are in fact rip-offs. They are clocked at the same speed as Intel, but they have fewer cores. This means that the $115 AMD CPU has only 33% as many cores as the $670 Intel CPU.\n\nThe difference in performance depends on what you are doing. For example, if you are using a CPU-heavy application like Photoshop, the $115 AMD CPU will probably be slower. If you are using a CPU-light application like a word processor, the $115 AMD CPU will probably be faster", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a number of possible reasons why this might happen, but the most likely explanation is that it is a result of a disorder called, 'sleep eye movement disorder' (SEMD). When a person sleeps, the eyes move around in a natural way. The brain also keeps the eyes from moving too much, so that they do not, for example, turn in the opposite direction when a person is lying on their back, or turn to the side when a person is lying on their side. This movement of the eyes is called 'eye movement' or 'eye movement disorder' (EMD). E", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: Most people who are given a terminal diagnosis don't get that long. It's actually a lot more common for people to be told they've got a few months to live than for them to be told they've got a few years to live.\n\nIt's rare for someone to be diagnosed with a terminal illness and then to die 6 months later, it's more common for someone to be told they've got a few months to live and then to die 6 months later.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this. The first is that it takes time for the cancer", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In the AI era, music can be used to help train AI to be more human.

This was the time when the West\n\n*   Took over the Holy Land and became the protectors of the Holy places.\n*   Intervened in the", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar can be bad for you if you eat too much of it. It's calorie dense, so if you have a lot of it in one day, you'll end up eating more calories than you need.\n\nSugar has also been linked to a number of diseases, and has been linked to increased rates of diabetes, obesity, and heart disease.\n\nIt's also bad for you because it makes you crave more sugar. It's very addictive.\n\nThere are also a lot of sugary drinks that you can buy that are", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week. However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: It's mainly because of the different formats, but also because of the different time zones. British shows are usually live and air at 22:00, American shows are recorded and air at 02:00 (or 01:00 depending on the show). The UK audience has to wait for a week to catch up, but the American audience can watch the same episode in the same week. Because of this, American shows have a large amount of viewers who watch the same episode each week. The late night talk shows can also be compared to the early morning news shows in the UK. Both", "\n\nHuman: Origin of \"In Mother Russia...\" jokes\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't know, I didn't", "\n\nHuman: Colloidal silver?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Colloidal silver is an antimicrobial agent. It is made by suspending silver particles in a solution. The particles are so small that they do not react with the solution. This prevents the silver particles from becoming\n\ndissolved or precipitated, and they remain suspended in solution. The colloidal silver solution is then added to water to make it an antimicrobial agent. In many cases, it is not necessary to add any water to the colloidal silver. However, some people may prefer to add water, and then use the resulting solution as a spray. Some people", "\n\nHuman: Why do you \"drive\" a car, but \"pilot\" a boat, plane, etc.?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons for this. In the English language, \"drive\" is used to indicate that the vehicle is powered by an internal combustion engine. \"Pilot\" is used to indicate that the vehicle is powered by a non-internal combustion engine. For example, \"drive a car\" is acceptable because the car is powered by an internal combustion engine. \"Pilot a boat\" is not because the boat is not powered by an internal combustion engine.\n\nThe other reason is that \"drive\" and \"pilot\" are generally used in different context", "\n\nHuman: Why do popular reddit posts tend to cap out around 4k up votes when there is such a big amount of people using reddit?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Popularity is a subjective metric, and can be difficult to pin down. There are plenty of posts that have become popular that aren't as well-known as the ones you mention, and vice versa. The popularity of a post on Reddit is a function of a number of things, including the post's content, the number of upvotes, the number of comments, the number of times the post has been submitted, the number of posts and comments it has generated, the number of different subreddits the post has been posted to, and the number of times it has been shared on Reddit", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It would not be able to break through the other material because it is too hard to break. But if you break it down to a smaller size it may be able to break through. If it was made out of diamond, then it would be able to break through other pieces of diamond. If it was made out of other materials, then it would be able to break through it.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the Xbox One need a brick in between the outlet plug and the console where as the PS4 doesn't?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The brick is there to protect the console from power surges and to provide a grounding point for the outlet plug. The PS4 has a different configuration, and doesn't need a brick. The console is hardwired to the outlet, and the brick is not needed.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: Chlorophyll is green because it contains a pigment called chlorophyll that absorbs red and blue light. It does not absorb all the light it encounters.  The light that is not absorbed is reflected back as green light.\n\nThe chlorophyll in leaves is green because it absorbs red and blue light. \nThe green light is then reflected back as green light. \nThe reflection of light is how the human eye perceives green.\n\nChlorophyll absorbs light at two different wavelengths. \nThe absorption of red light is", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It is possible that cannabinoids are still detected in the urine for 3 days, but they are not detectable in the blood for 3-4 days. This is why it is important to do a test after 3-4 days. Also, the amount of THC that is detectable in urine is a lot higher than in blood, even with a THC concentration of 100 ng/ml in blood.\n\nTHC is detectable in urine for up to 30 days, but only for 3-4 days in blood. THC is detectable in ur", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer to this question is quite complicated. In the simplest terms, liquids are considered to be those substances that have a viscosity of less than 100 centipoise. There are some substances that have a viscosity of less than 100 centipoise but are still considered to be a liquid. For example, water has a viscosity of less than 100 centipoise but is still considered to be a liquid. This is because it has a very low density and flows easily. Substances that have a very low viscosity and a very low density are", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing.

Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: The mouse is connected to a computer, which is connected to the monitor. The mouse has a\n\nposition sensor that gives it the position of the mouse. When you move the mouse, the position sensor gives the computer the position of the mouse. The computer then moves the cursor on the screen to the position of the mouse.", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The way they get around the problem is to either have the camera\nbehind the mirror or use a special kind of mirror that has a reflective side that\nreflects the image, but the camera doesn't show up in the mirror. The other way is to\ndo the scene with a different camera angle. For example, if the camera is behind the\nmirror, the reflection of the camera can be removed by simply moving the camera to a\ndifferent angle. Another technique is to use a mirror that has a reflective side but the\ncamera is behind the mirror. The camera won't show up in", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the U.S., circumcision is a common practice that has been performed for over 3,000 years. Although the reasons for performing it are based on religious, cultural, and medical reasons, in the past 100 years it has become a common practice for the prevention of diseases.\n\nThe practice of circumcision is a religious one, performed in the Jewish faith and some Muslim faiths.

Chess is a zero-sum game with fixed number of moves, and every possible state of the board is reachable from the start state. Go has a finite number of possible states, but the number of states is infinite, because the\nrules are infinite (there are no rules in Go).\n\nChess has a fixed number of moves that are reachable from the start state. Each possible state of the board is reachable from the start state. Go has an infinite number of moves that are reachable from the start state. The number of states is", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: I'm no expert,  but I've always found that when you're cooking for yourself,  you're not going to use the same ingredients,  the same sauces,  the same techniques,  or the same cooking methods that a restaurant uses.  That's why restaurants are able to make food that tastes the same every time.  But if you're trying to re-create that,  it's unlikely you'll be able to achieve that same result.  Also,  it's possible that you're not using the same amount of", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer is simple. Squinting helps us to focus on the image we are trying to see. When we look at something that is far away, the image is blurry. When we squint, we are focusing the image more, which makes it easier to see.  When we look at something that is close, the image is sharper. When we look at something close, we can't squint. We can focus the image by moving the eye closer to it. This is why we don't squint when we look at something close.", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The main ingredient of carbonated water is water, but\ndifferent types of carbonated water use different ingredients to\nproduce carbon dioxide. Carbonated water is made by adding\ncarbon dioxide to water. The water used to make carbonated\nwater is called 'raw water'. Carbonated water can be made\nusing a natural source of carbon dioxide, like carbonated mineral\nwater, or by using a\ncarbon dioxide gas source.\n\nCarbonated mineral water is made by adding minerals to water\nand then adding carbon", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The difference in spelling between American English and British English is a matter of history. American English is the result of the British colonies in America. English is spoken throughout the British Isles and in many countries. It is a language that has evolved over many centuries. The English spoken in the UK is known as British English. Americans have a version of the language that is based on British English. It is known as American English. In the 17th century, people who spoke English in America used a different spelling system. The English spoken in America was not influenced by the spelling system used in the UK. For", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The shower water temperature is determined by the water temperature coming from the hot water heater. If you push the button to increase the water temperature, the water from the hot water heater is coming at a higher temperature, and the shower water temperature will be higher. If you push the button to decrease the water temperature, the water from the hot water heater is coming at a lower temperature, and the shower water temperature will be lower.", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014. What has happened during the last 12 months? Is the situation better or worse?\n\nAssistant: ISIS started with a territorial goal of establishing a caliphate. This goal was not achieved, but it has expanded its influence to several countries. It was able to control the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah in Iraq, and the city of Tikrit in Iraq. In Syria, it gained control of the city of Raqqa and established a quasi-state. It also gained control over some areas in Libya and Yemen. ISIS has lost some of its territory, but has also been able to expand into some countries.\n\nISIS has also been able to gain more influence", "\n\nHuman: How does having a record label help bands, and how would an indie label differ from a major label?\n\nI've searched this many times but have yet to get a clear answer. anyone have a simple explanation that could be a little more clear?\n\nAssistant: A record label is a company that manages the careers of artists. These artists are called \"label artists\" or \"label recording artists\". A record label\nworks as a label for the artists, and a label for the artists' work. Labels typically operate as a division of a larger company that also deals with other artists. It is not uncommon for the same company to manage the careers of a variety of artists from different labels. A label typically provides the funding to enable the artists to record and promote their music. The label also provides the artist with a business manager and legal counsel. In exchange for", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Trains can pull a lot of weight because they have a lot of wheels. The more wheels you have the more you can pull. If a train is pulling a lot of weight then it is called a heavy train. The limit to the amount of weight a train can pull is the number of cars that the tracks can handle. The more cars a train has the more it can pull. The limit for a train is about 200 cars. If you have more than 200 cars you need another train. The most cars that are pulled by a train are about 200 cars. If you have", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Modern technology has made it possible for ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics to be accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference. We do this by comparing the ancient text to the texts from the same time period, using the same language, and the same writing style. For example, if the ancient text is in French, and it is compared to the same text from the same time period, we can make a fair guess as to what the text says. If the text is in English, we can compare it to the same text from the same time period, and we can make a fair guess as", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Well, when something is wet, it's actually more exposed to the world around it.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a bag of dog food and you take it out of the bag and dump it in the bowl. When it's in the bowl, it's not exposed to the outside world (i.e. air,\nhumans, other animals, etc.).\n\nBut when you leave it out, it's exposed to everything around it, and the more you leave it out, the more exposed it is to the world.\n\nNow, when you smell", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In a nutshell, they are trying to recreate the conditions of the Big Bang, the beginning of our universe. This will give us a better understanding of how our universe came to be. It will also give us an better understanding of our universe and how it works, which will\nhelp us to understand more about everything in it, such as the origins of life, the origins of our planet, and the origins of our galaxy.", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a complex question. To answer it, we should first look at the definition of the political spectrum. The political spectrum is a way of viewing the ideologies of a society. The political spectrum divides ideologies into two broad groups: left and right. This\n\nis a generalization, of course, and not every country uses the same terminology, but generally speaking, the left represents the group that favors increased government involvement in the economy, the right favors less government involvement. A political spectrum can be\n\nvisualized as a line with left-wing ideas on the left side of the line", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Time is a human construct, so the fact that you are on earth and that you can measure time in earth years, does not necessarily mean that you are on earth for a year. You might be on earth for 1 year, 100 years, 1000 years, or 10000 years, depending on how much you travel, and how much time elapses between each time you return to earth. So it is not the case that you would age 20 years, but it is possible that you could have aged 20 years, or 1000 years,", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When the French Revolutionary government decided in 1792 to establish a\nnew system of units of measure, they decided to base them on the length of the meter. The meter was defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the pole along a meridian, which was a defined as the length of the earth's\n\\\n\nThe French government did not have the capability to measure this distance accurately. Instead, they defined the meter as the length of the bar of a platinum-iridium alloy. This bar was called the \"International", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because you are an adult, you have an immune system, so your body is able to fight off the pain from the soap, but when you are a little kid your immune system hasn't developed yet, so you have to deal with the pain.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the 1990s, astronomers found that the outermost planet in the Solar System, Neptune, was actually slightly more massive than the \ntheorized 8th planet, Pluto. This was a surprise, since it had been expected that the two planets would have the same mass. This lead to the discovery that there was likely a 9th planet in the Solar System, which would be called 1992 QB1. Since then, it has been discovered that the 9th planet was likely captured from the Kuiper belt, and is no", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The new widow female may have eaten her mate because she was hungry. She may have eaten him because she was hungry. She may have eaten him because she didn't know how to mate, or because she didn't know how to get enough food for herself. She may have eaten him because she didn't know how to mate, or because she didn't know how to get enough food for herself. She may have eaten him because she didn't know how to mate, or because she didn't know how to get enough food for herself. She may have eaten him", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Lemon and limes are from the citrus family. They are not\nfruit, but rather are modified leaves with fruits and seeds inside. They are not sweet, so animals do not carry them away from the tree. If you want to carry them away from the tree, you have to do it yourself.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: Some of the movies use product placement in order to have some money for the movie. However, the product placement is always subtle and it is not the main plot of the movie. If the movie is a comedy, it will be more visible. The payments for the product placement are", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: The technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link are as follows:", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers!

The Greeks and Turks have still not agreed on a solution to the issue.", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Because children are easier to bury and preserve.\n\nChildren are smaller than adults. In the ice man case, the child was frozen in ice, so it was easier to preserve the body. But even in other cases, there are two reasons that children are easier to preserve than adults. One is that children were often buried in burial sites where the adults were buried. That means that the child would be buried in the same burial site as the adults, which would make it easier to preserve them. The other reason is that children were buried in a way that made it easier to preserve them. They", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Physical differences between males and females are a result of the physical differences between the two sexes. In most species, males and females are distinct from each other. They have different sizes,\ndifferent structures, and different functions.  The differences between males and females help species adapt to their\n\nhabitats. For example, the differences between males and females of most species make it possible for the two sexes to mate and reproduce. The size and shape of males and females also helps them to survive in their habitat. The differences between males and females are also related to the roles that each sex plays in the survival of", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: EL15:  The theoretical limit is 256, which is the number of bits per second.  In practice, bandwidth is often limited by the modem's ability to communicate.  If your modem is 100 Mbps, you can theoretically send 100 Mbps of data per second.  But, if your connection is slow due to congestion, you won't be able to send any data.", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In the days before alarm clocks, people woke up at a certain time by using a variety of methods.

In many cases, they would have used a\n\n[removed]", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Yes. You should use the coin tossing strategy known as 'the Martingale' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(game)). This is a betting strategy where you start with a small amount, and double your bet every time you lose. If you keep winning, you keep betting the same amount, and if you keep losing, you keep betting the same amount.\n\nIf you keep losing, you will eventually win the bet. If you keep winning, you will eventually lose the bet.\n\nHowever, if you keep winning, you will keep betting the same amount", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun was an accessory for the NES that came with a game. It was a plastic gun that you would hold up to the TV screen, and when you had a game that needed a gun, you would put the light gun in the NES and point it at the screen and it would shoot and it would make the game work.\n\nThe light gun was not an accessory that was built into the NES. It was a separate device that you could buy to play games with.\nThe gun was an accessory that came with a game. The NES did not have a light gun", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There is a lot of politics in this answer, but the basic idea is that they would have to go through a process of identifying the person, trying to identify their country of origin, and then contacting the country's government to see if they would be willing to take them. If the country isn't willing, then they would have to wait for the person to either be able to prove their citizenship or be deported. If they are able to prove their citizenship, then they would be allowed to stay. If they are not, then they would be deported.", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer is that it is not possible to divide by zero. The answer is not\npossible because the question is not make sense. It is also not possible because the division by zero is not defined. If the division by zero is not defined, then the answer is not possible. The division by zero is not defined because the division by zero is the same as 0/0.

Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: I don't know how \"one another\" is derived from, but if you're saying that it makes grammatical sense to say \"one and other\" then yes.

If the metal ones come loose, it is possible for the toilet seat to come off. Because the toilet seat is very heavy, it could fall onto the person sitting on it.

It's just like what's happening in Saudi Arabia. It's not the UN's problem. If they want to do anything, they have to get the Qatari government to do it.

Is there a biological dofference in their libido?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: No, I'm not sure. The reason for this is that having sex with a stranger does not necessarily mean that you're having sex with a stranger. You might have a casual hookup with a person who you've met before, but don't know very well. You might have sex with a stranger if you're drunk and you don't know the person's name.

If you\u2019re constipated for a long time, it can lead to some serious digestion problems,\nand that might be why you have a lot of poops that require a lot of wiping.

It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: I think it is because the most popular manga/anime are based off of the most popular stories. In some cases they are based off of older stories. For example, Naruto is based off of an old Japanese story called Ninja Scroll. In that story the characters are children because that is how the original story was written. The same for Bleach. It was based off of an old Japanese story called Shaman King, and those characters are children too. The same for Death Note. It was based off of an old Japanese story called Death Note.

If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a natural process that allows some animals to hibernate and rest for a long period of time. The length of time they stay in the same position is different for each animal. The hibernation process is very different from sleep, because animals that hibernate do not wake up when they are hungry. While they are hibernating, their bodies are working to save energy and stay warm. They do not eat, drink or sleep, but they are still alive. When they wake up in the spring, they are ready to go on living their lives. Animals that hibernate can do this because their bodies are able", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: One of the reasons that learning a language is easier than speaking it is that it's possible to do it\nin a step-by-step way. This involves practicing a little bit of the language every day, over a long period of time.\nThe other reason is that while learning a language, it's not necessary to speak it in order to learn. If you don't know any, you can just listen to it, or read it.\nIn contrast, when you're learning to speak a language, you can't just listen to it, or read it, in order to learn it.", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: The Braille writing is on the same signs as the regular text.

One reason is that it allows the printer to add a little extra white space in the back of the book, which helps the pages lay in the binding better. Another reason is that it gives the publisher a little extra room to add additional material if the book is reprinted in the future. This is especially helpful if there are later editions of the book or if there are corrections, updates, or revisions that need to be made to the book in the future. Another reason is that it makes the book look more complete. If you look at the back of a book, there is usually a", "\n\nHuman: Meditation\n\nHow do I do it? What does it do? Does it actually work?\n\nAssistant: Meditation is a way to focus your mind on one thing, and it works by bringing your mind to a state of calmness. It helps you deal with the stress of daily life. By reducing stress, meditation can help you cope with the physical and mental effects of stress. It can also help you relax, sleep better, and feel more positive about yourself and your life. But it's not a quick fix for your stress. It requires practice. The more you practice meditation, the better you'll be able to deal with stress and its effects.\n\nMeditation has been used for thousands of years", "\n\nHuman: Why can insurance companies charge based on race/sex/age and not be sued for discrimination?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because insurance companies are not based in the United States.

One way would be to have a write in candidate that is very well known and has a high", "\n\nHuman: How did people used to train pigeons to carry mail at the long distance, back in the day?\n\nI was always curious, did they have different pigeon for each address and if not, how pigeon knows whom to send? \n\nAssistant: The answer is long distance, it's hard to say back in the day because pigeons were used for many different things, some of them were used for mail, some were used for racing, and some were used to carry messages. In general, pigeons were", "\n\nHuman: Why are people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war shamed instead of admired? Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't think that there was any shame associated with not participating in the war. The draft was a lottery. The draft was a lottery. You could try to avoid it by going to college or by joining the military and then getting a deferment. You could also get a deferment by getting married.\n\nPeople who were drafted were expected to serve, but they could try to get out of it.\nSome people who got out of the draft did it because they were trying to avoid the war, others did it because they were trying to avoid going to prison.\nThere was no", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The Neanderthal genome has been sequenced, but it is not yet possible to recreate a Neanderthal from scratch. We do know that some of the genetic differences between modern humans and Neanderthals were due to genetic changes that occurred after the Neanderthals and modern humans diverged from a common ancestor. It is not possible to know what those changes were or how they would be interpreted in the case of a recreated Neanderthal. The Neanderthal genome also contains a large number of differences from the modern human genome. It is not clear whether these differences", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Transgender people are assigned a gender at birth that they do not identify with.

It's not just the THC in marijuana that makes people feel good, or that makes music sound better, or that makes things more funny. It's the whole experience of smoking marijuana, including the smell, the taste, the feel of the smoke, the feeling of being high, the smoking rituals, etc. THC is one of the many compounds in marijuana, but it's not the only one. A lot of compounds in marijuana are compounds that are also found in nature, and that are", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Package stores are in business for one reason: it's a great business to be in. They have no employees, they are never closed, and they're located in some of the best real estate in the world. The state of Massachusetts takes 64% of their revenue, but, for this to be a successful business, they need to sell", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Shrimp and other seafood contain a substance called hemocyanin, which is a copper-based pigment that gives it the color red. When it is cooked, it turns orange due to the action of the heat on the copper, which causes it to become more reactive and releases more oxygen. This is the same reaction that happens to the meat when it is cooked, but the meat contains hemoglobin, a more stable compound that does not release oxygen when heated. So, instead of turning red, it turns brown. The color of the meat is not", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: There is no answer to this question. Divide by zero is an error in the software.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I think it's because fast food is more convenient and relatively cheaper. It's faster to get fast food than to have to go to the grocery store. Fast food is also cheaper than going to the grocery store because it's a lot of money to go to the grocery store and you have to buy a lot of things. It's also a lot of time to go to the grocery store. Fast food is also healthier because you're going to the grocery store to get fresh food. It's healthier to go to the grocery store", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: American politics have become more polarized in the last decades, but they have been even more divided since the election of Donald Trump. This polarization has been happening in all countries, including the UK and", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods? Meaning, you had to live in the same block/city to connect to it? \n\n\nAssistant: That's right. BBSes (Bulletin Board Systems) were local area networks that people could connect to and share\nfiles. \n\nThey were often set up by the owner of a computer or a local club. \n\nIt was a way to connect to other people in your neighborhood, to exchange\nfiles, and to chat with each other. \n\nSome of the first BBSes were set up in the 1980s. \n\nBBSes were different from the Internet. The Internet is a global network that is run by the people who use it.", "\n\nHuman: What is Russell's paradox? and please explain like i am 5, i don't know anything.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Russell's paradox is a paradox in set theory.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: I have no idea, but I have an answer to your question. It seems to me that Iranian views on transsexuality are a cultural thing, but I don't know why.\n\nI'm also not sure whether it's unique to Shia or Twelver Shia Islam. I've never heard of any other countries being very accepting of transsexuals, so I'd assume it's unique to Iran.", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: Depression is a side effect of so many prescription drugs because it is a common symptom of the disease the drug is treating. In order to treat the disease, the drug has to be strong enough to kill the disease-causing bacteria, virus, fungus or cell. But since the drug is strong enough to kill the disease-causing organism, it can also kill healthy cells. This is why the drug can cause side effects like depression. There is also a psychological component of taking medicine. Many people take medicine to feel better. If they do not feel better, they feel like", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear? Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: The color of water is determined by the amount of sunlight that the water absorbs and reflects. Water that absorbs a great deal of sunlight appears to be very dark. Water that reflects a great deal of sunlight appears to be very light, but the color of the light is the same as the color of the sky. The color of the sunlight is dependent on the color of the atmosphere. If the atmosphere is green, the water appears to be green. If the atmosphere is blue, the water appears to be blue. The color of the sunlight is determined by the color of the atmosphere. The sunlight", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It doesn't work because the NES zapper for Duck hunt only works on CRT TVs. The NES zapper for Duck hunt was made in the 1980s when CRT TVs were more common. CRT TVs were replaced by flat screens in the 1990s. Therefore, the NES zapper for Duck hunt only works on CRT TVs. There are also newer games that work with the NES zapper for Duck hunt, but it is not compatible with newer TVs. The NES zapper for Duck", "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between 32 and 64bit computer systems, and why aren't there, say 128bit systems.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There's no technical reason why there can't be 128 bit or 256 bit systems. But there's no reason why you'd want to use one. 32 bit systems have limitations, but they're not bad. 64 bit systems have even more limitations, and they're not good. I'll try to explain.\n\nThe 32 bit system has two limitations. One is that it can only use 4GB of memory. That's only a problem if you're running a 32 bit operating system. If you're running", "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I have no idea.

Gun laws should be enacted to prevent people from committing gun crimes, like murder, and to keep guns from criminals, like felons. Gun laws should not prevent law-abiding people from\n\n\u2192", "\n\nHuman: Why do banks offer interest? What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Banks offer interest for a number of reasons. The main reason is that they want to attract customers to their products, and they also want to make sure that customers are satisfied with their products. Banks need to pay interest in order to get customers to borrow from them. They also have to pay interest on the money that they borrow from other banks. Banks also make money from interest by charging a certain interest rate on loans to customers. They charge this interest rate on the money that they lend out. The reason for this is that they want to make sure that they can repay the money that they have lent", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Income inequality is a topic of great interest and debate. The evidence\nis mixed. A recent study by Piketty et al. (2019) shows that US income inequality has increased in the past few decades, but not as much as in some other developed countries. Income inequality in the US is still less\n\nthan in countries like France and the UK. But it is also true that the US has had more episodes of rising inequality in the past. The Great Gatsby \n\nEconomics (2005) shows that the US has experienced several episodes of rising inequality in", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge? If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: It's not for people who are driving under the overpass. It's for people who are driving under the overpass. They're for people who are driving under the overpass.", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly. I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: It's a mystery. It's probably just a joke.", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: The train noise is caused by the change in the pressure in the air. When it gets colder, the air pressure decreases. Increased pressure causes the sound to be louder. So when the pressure decreases, it is quieter. The train noise is not actually quieter during winter, but rather the air pressure is lower, which makes the train noise seem quieter.", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: I think that this is because college education is\n\n- a) a good way to learn about the world and expand one's horizons; and\n- b) a good way to learn about social issues and the political system of the United States.\n\nAs a result, people who have college degrees tend to be more open to learning about and thinking about the world, and to learning about and thinking about politics. I think that this is the primary reason why college-educated people tend to be more liberal and left-wing.\n\nAnother reason for the correlation is that liberal and left-wing people", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: I think it's a mixture of different things. First of all, you're right. People's voices change when they sing, and it's for a variety of reasons. One of the reasons is that there's a lot of strain on the voice.\n\nThe larynx, or voice box, is made of cartilage, so it's not very flexible. When you're speaking, the larynx is at rest. But when you're singing, it has to move in order to change the pitch of the sound. This can cause a lot of strain on the", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When the winds move the clouds, they carry the vapour with them. This is why the shape of the cloud is maintained. \n\nThe water vapour condenses to form the clouds. When the winds blow the clouds, the water vapour condenses and is carried by the winds. This is why the shape of the cloud is maintained.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I can answer that, but here's a few ideas:\n\n1. Larger animals have a higher surface area to volume ratio, so they tend to have a higher metabolic rate. Their metabolic rate is determined by their size, their surface area, their shape, their temperature, and their water content. Smaller animals have lower metabolic rates, and so live longer.\n2. Larger animals have a higher rate of cell division, and so their tissues grow at a faster rate. This means they have a faster rate of wear and tear, and so live", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't know why we call our parents mom and dad, but I think it has to do with our\n\nA.I. being children.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: The significant digits in the answer are 25.75. 25.75 is the exact answer. The rounding and estimating is what you do to get the 25.75 answer. You might want to get an answer for your answer, then get the answer for that answer. You could keep doing this forever. Or you might just want to get an answer for your answer. If you do this, it's called rounding.\n\nOr you might want to get an answer for your answer. You could keep doing this forever. Or you might just want to get", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: I'm not a doctor, so I don't know the answer to that, but I do know that there are a number of different enzymes that help break down the fats in your diet.  The liver is responsible for storing bile, which helps digest fats.  When you eat a meal, bile flows from your liver into your small intestine to help break down the fats.  The gallbladder is a sac that stores the bile.  The bile is released into your small intestine when you eat a meal.  The b", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: That is the sound of the electron gun inside the CRT turning on and off.

It will get lou", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A battery is a rechargeable power source. It contains two types of chemicals, one which can be discharged, and one which can be recharged. When a battery is discharged, the chemicals are used up and they cannot be recharged. When the battery is recharged, the chemicals are recharged, but it takes more time for them to be fully charged than for them to be discharged. The battery is fully recharged when the chemicals have been recharged fully, and when there is a low amount of electricity left in the battery. If the", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: This is a question that has been asked by a lot of people. Let's try to answer it by looking at the science. The child's mother is probably trying to tell him that he needs to stop because it's not healthy. The child probably is oblivious to the fact that spinning in circles is bad for you. He's probably just enjoying it. So why is spinning in circles not healthy? The answer is that spinning in circles makes you dizzy. The more you spin, the more dizzy you get. If you spin too much, it will make you", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Big Bang Theory LI5 is an idea that was developed in the 1920s by the astronomer George Gamow to explain the origin of the universe.

It's not really", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Ethernet is an electrical and signaling protocol used to connect computers. It is based on a master/slave architecture where a single network cable connects a computer to a hub, which is connected to a switch, which is connected to a router, which is connected to the internet. The problem with this architecture is that if a single device, like a computer, fails, the entire network stops working. This is because the master (the computer) can only talk to the slaves (the hub, the switch, the router) and not to the other way around. However, if the master fails, the slaves cannot talk", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We have a number of special visual cells that allow us to see colours.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's because water is a polar molecule which is attracted to the non-polar skin. It's just like how water is attracted to a sponge. The water molecules will pull all the water out of the skin, causing it to dry out. Water is also a good solvent, so it will also pull out the fatty acids, making your skin dry and wrinkly.\n\nThe more water, the more the skin will be drawn out of it. This is why when you are in water for a long time, the skin will become wrinkly.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: There are two main reasons for this. The first is that the telescopes can only see objects that emit energy in the visible spectrum of light. Since the Moon is dark, it doesn't emit any light in the visible range. The second reason is that the telescopes are\nmuch better at seeing objects far away than they are at seeing objects close up. They can see far away objects better because they are much bigger. When you look at a small object close up, it's hard to tell what it is. The moon is just a few hundred kilometers across. It's hard for the telescop", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The liquid you drink is composed of both water and other ingredients. It may be water, but the other ingredients can include\ncarbohydrates, fats, and alcohol. When you drink liquid, you lose water by swallowing, and the body can lose water through urine and perspiration. If you drink a\nnon-water beverage, the loss of water by the body is greater than the amount of water in the beverage. Therefore, you become dehydrated. For example, you lose 20 ounces of water by drinking a", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The term Hispanic or Latino refers to people who originate from Spain and are of Latin American descent.

I will probably have to give up and just continue to disagree with the explanations, but I'm hoping someone might be able to help me understand.\n\n\nAssistant: > The Monty Hall problem is a famous problem in probability theory and has been the subject of many books and articles.\n\nIn the original version of the problem, there are three doors, behind one of which is a prize. You choose door #3, and then the host (Monty Hall) opens one of the other two doors. It turns out that door #2 has nothing behind it, so now you have to decide whether to switch your choice of door to door #1 or not.\n\nThe problem is, mathematically, that if you choose door #3, then you have a 1/", "\n\nHuman: when cannabis was still illegal in the US, how did high profile smokers e.g. Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogen etc. Not get charged for possesion?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but I'm assuming they had a good lawyer who didn't get them caught.", "\n\nHuman: How can websites track you based on your monitor size?\n\nWhenever I try to use Tor in full screen, a message pops up that says, \"Maximizing tor Browser can allow websites to determine your monitor size, which can be used to track you. We recommend that you leave tor windows in their original default size.\"\n\nHow exactly does that work?\n\nAssistant: When you maximize a browser window, it's possible for websites to infer the size of the monitor you're using. That's because most browsers have a fixed number of pixels on the screen, and a fixed number of pixels between each element (e.g. the text in the browser window, the title bar, the toolbar, etc.). By comparing the pixel size of an element, it's possible to determine what size monitor you're using. For example, the width of a text element might be 40 pixels, while the height might be 30 pixels.\n\nThe browser you're", "\n\nHuman: How bad is the U.S.'s education really?\n\nI can't seem to find any good sources on the notion that the U.S. sucks at education?

That way, we could save space in our homes and reduce our energy use. However, there are some challenges to making such a machine. The first is that there are some machines that are better at washing clothes and others that are better at drying. Second, even though the machine might be able to wash and dry clothes at the same time, we still might need to make some separate machines for doing just one of the tasks. For example, we might need to make a machine that can only dry clothes because it would have", "\n\nHuman: From crack to current, what is the story behind Toronto mayor Rob Ford?\n\nWhat has Toronto mayor Rob Ford been accused of doing?
