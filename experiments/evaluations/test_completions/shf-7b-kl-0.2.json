Why something close to 2d in shape?\n\n\nEdit:  Also, posted to /r/askscience [here](_URL_0_) at Jeordeon's suggestion.\n\nEdit II:  Removed bonus question because I realized it is way beyond an ELI5\n\nAssistant: The answer to your question is that galaxies form planar discs because of the effects of gravity. Gravity pulls material together over long distances, resulting in the formation of stars and other objects that form a flat, disc-like structure. This is because the gravitational pull of the objects in the disc is stronger in the plane of the disc, rather than along the axis of rotation. This causes the material to accumulate in a flat, disc-like structure. Additionally, the rotation of the galaxy helps to maintain the disc shape.", "\n\nHuman: What is a career in project management like; what do they do ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

For instance, the repeating decimal 1.111111... is infinite, but you'll never find a 5 in there along the way. However, infinitely repeating numbers and an infinite universe (or infinite number of universes) seem like an entirely different concept.\n\nAssistant: Do you have any other questions?", "\n\nHuman: What is the Fast Fourier Transform? (Or FFT) and how does one go on implementing it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is an algorithm used to transform a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain, and vice versa. It is commonly used in signal processing, such as when analyzing audio signals. It involves breaking a signal up into its frequency components, and then representing those components in terms of their amplitude and phase. It can also be used to detect frequencies in a signal that are too low or too high to be heard by humans. The algorithm itself is quite complex, but can be implemented using specialized software or hardware.", "\n\nHuman: Audio Data Compression\n\nI'm working on a project where we have to compress an audio file (so we can have it be loseless) and we have to judge SQNR as well as sound quality compared to original (qualitative). \n\nI'm not sure how any of this works (my professor doesn't seem that good at explaining things).
