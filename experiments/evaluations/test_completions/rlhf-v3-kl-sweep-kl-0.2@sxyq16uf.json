I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: Well, Kirchhoff's First Law is an equation that states that the sum of the currents entering a junction is equal to the sum of the currents leaving it. This law is important because it can be used to determine the currents in a circuit. For example, if you know the currents entering and leaving a junction, you can use Kirchhoff's First Law to determine the current through the other elements in the circuit. It can also be used to determine the resistance of a circuit.", "\n\nHuman: Why does rain look stationary from a distance?\n\nWhen looking at a thunderstorm from far away you can see the rain coming down to the ground but it just looks as if the cloud is extended in sheets towards the earth.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: What operating system are you using?", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the aperture is the size of the hole in the lens that controls the amount of light that passes through it. The larger the aperture, the less light that passes, resulting in a lower depth of field. Conversely, the smaller the aperture, the more light that passes, resulting in a greater depth of field.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: What type of work are we talking about?", "\n\nHuman: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What are the side effects of taking expired medicines?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Chinese and Mexican food often contain spicy and oily ingred", "\n\nHuman: why do giraffes have horns?\n\nI was just wondering...\nEdit: thanks for all the responses you guys even the bad ones :D And no I don't think that giraffes have ended their evolution process, your reading into it to much.\n\nAssistant: Giraffes have horns for protection against predators and to help them defend their herd.", "\n\nHuman: Can you change the temperature of a subject with sound alone?\n\nTo clarify I don't mean temperature produced by whatever produces the sound. I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: Yes, sound waves can be used to heat objects. The concept is known as sonochemistry, and it involves using sound waves to cause chemical reactions and even to break down pollutants in water. In addition, sound waves can be used to increase the temperature of an object. This is done by focusing sound waves on a specific spot, which increases the local temperature in that spot. This can be used to heat up an area without any physical contact. The exact mechanism by which this works is not completely understood, but it is believed to be due to the transfer of energy from the sound waves to the mole", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we drool when we sleep?

Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: What's the purpose of the mysterious slash at the end of URLs?", "\n\nHuman: Why does the US have to be close allies with Saudi Arabia?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Could you repeat the question?", "\n\nHuman: How is Hacking possible.\n\nThis is a really hard concept for me so please bear with me.

It prevents witnesses from being harassed or intimidated from testifying, it prevents evidence from being lost or destroyed, and it encourages citizens to report crimes without fear of reprisal. It also prevents innocent people from being wrongfully accused and punished for crimes they didn\u2019t commit.", "\n\nHuman: How do people accidentally die from auto-erotic asphyxiation?\n\nIf the human brain can survive for upwards of 3 minutes (no training) without oxygen, how do so many people accidentally kill themselves while asphyxiating themselves/having their partner asphyxiate them during sex/masturbation? Can't they just stop choking themselves when it gets sketchy? And once they pass out, doesn't the body automatically breathe for them/if applicable their partner would stop choking them?\n\nAssistant: Auto-erotic asphyxiation is the practice of intentionally restricting oxygen intake during masturbation or sexual activity for pleasure, usually by using a noose around the neck or other constricting device. People can accidentally kill themselves by doing this if they lose consciousness or the chokehold is too tight, preventing them from breathing. The body does not automatically breathe for them, so they must manually intervene and can easily pass out or die if they don't.", "\n\nHuman: The movement of long string-like things through the air/water\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
