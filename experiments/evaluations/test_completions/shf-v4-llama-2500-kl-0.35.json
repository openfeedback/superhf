Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: It is a popular question.  I see a lot of people asking it.  I think the short answer is no.  I think the longer answer is no, but I am not a geneticist so I would not want to speculate too much.  There is no doubt that we have a lot to learn about the genome of Neanderthals, but even if we did, we would still have to have a good idea of the epigenetic environment of Neanderthals, the environment in which they lived, and the environment in which the cells of the human would live.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: Iran is one of the few Muslim countries that doesn't have a death penalty for homosexuality.\n\nIran also has the largest transsexual population in the Middle East, and one of the largest in the world.\n\nIt's a very liberal and accepting country compared to other Muslim countries.\n\nIt's the only country in the Middle East where transsexual people can get official ID cards, and they have the right to marry and to adopt children.\n\nIt's also the only Muslim country in the world where transsexuals can go through sex reassignment surgery.", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine?

It is usually an unpleasant side effect of an antidepressant. In most cases, the side effect is temporary, and the patient should not stop taking the medication.

Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: Water is clear. Blue/green is caused by the way light is reflected off the water.\n\nWater is blue/green because it contains dissolved substances. The most abundant dissolved substance in water is oxygen. Oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas that is essential to human life. Oxygen is the most abundant element in the Earth's crust, making up about 47% of the crust by mass.\n\nOxygen is a gas that forms about 21% of the Earth's atmosphere.

The Gini coefficient measures the extent to which income is concentrated among the top and bottom of the income distribution. The Gini coefficient is a value between 0 and 1.0. A value of 0 indicates perfect equality, where everyone has the same income. A value of 1.0 indicates perfect inequality, where one person has all the income. The Gini coefficient for the United States has varied between 0.40 and 0.55 over the past 40 years.

If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop...

However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: There are several factors that contribute to this. First, the education system is often dominated by liberals, and liberals tend to be more likely to pursue advanced degrees. This is a self-reinforcing system. Second, more educated people are more likely to be more liberal because they have a greater understanding of the world, and are more likely to have greater empathy. Third, more educated people are more likely to be able to afford to go to college, and this may be the single most important factor. Fourth, the more educated a person is, the more likely they are to be in a position", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Because the sound of a person's voice is determined by the shape of the vocal folds. When a person speaks, their vocal folds vibrate, which creates sound waves that come out of their mouth. When a person sings, their vocal folds vibrate in a different way, which creates sound waves that come out of their mouth in a different way. This makes their voice sound different.", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The clouds are made of tiny water droplets, which are very small compared to the size of the air molecules. As the air flows around the droplets, it bounces off them. This causes the air to move around the droplets. The droplets are so small that the air molecules do not bounce off them. This causes the droplets to move with the air. The droplets get bigger and smaller as the air moves around them. This makes the droplets change shape. This is why the clouds maintain their shape even when being blown through the sky.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer?

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: You are correct that you would leave it like that, but in the future you will be asked to round your answer to the nearest whole number.", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver has a bunch of special bile-storing cells called hepatocytes. Bile is a mixture of bile acids and bile salts, which are produced by the liver and help to digest fatty foods. Bile acids are made by the liver and stored in the liver, but bile salts are made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. When the liver senses that there is fat in the small intestine, it releases bile into the duodenum to help digest fatty foods. Bile is", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The TV is turning on and off.\n\n\\section{", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because of the law of conservation of energy.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: The water released by the cabbage is water that was already in the cabbage. The cabbage is 80% water, so when you cut the cabbage, you release some of the water from the cabbage. Salt water is a good conductor of heat, so when the salt water is mixed with the cabbage water, the temperature of the cabbage water increases, which causes the water to be released from the cabbage.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because the Moon is a mirror.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The water molecule (H2O) has a hydrogen atom with a positive charge (H+) and two oxygen atoms with a negative charge (-O-)", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand.", "\n\nHuman: Why do different countries have different outlets?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because different countries have different electrical currents.", "\n\nHuman: How exactly does a terror organization claim responsibility for an attack?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The way a terror organization claims responsibility for an attack is by saying that they did it.", "\n\nHuman: The Monty Hall Paradox/Problem\n\nI was inspired by reading [this comment](_URL_0_) as well as the explanation given in the movie 21.\n\nThe basics of the problem, taken from the link above:\n\n >  the monty hall paradox, you are given a choice of three doors with a prize behind one, you pick door #3. door #2 is opened, there is nothing behind it. you are given the the choice to switch your choice from door #3 to door #1, doing so increases your chances of winning every single time.\n\nI know this has been posted before, but I can't for the life of me wrap my head around it.

We recommend that you leave tor windows in their original default size.\"\n\nHow exactly does that work?\n\nAssistant: Tor Browser is a privacy and anonymity tool. It prevents websites from learning your real IP address, location, and other information about you. Tor Browser uses the Tor network to encrypt your traffic and bounce it around from servers all over the world. When you use Tor, your traffic is no longer identifiable as yours. However, if you use Tor in a window, Tor Browser can still identify your computer. This is because Tor Browser uses the size of your window to determine which servers you are using. This is similar to how your browser identifies your computer when you use your browser in a window.

Fire produces light, heat, and smoke.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Chinese and Mexican food contains high amounts of sodium. When we eat something that contains high amounts of sodium, the body tries to get rid of the excess sodium. The body flushes the sodium out through the kidneys. The kidneys release the sodium through urine. The kidneys then release the urine into the bladder. The bladder holds the urine until it is full. When the bladder is full, it tells the brain that the bladder is full. The brain then sends a message to the body to get rid of the urine.
