This is because the majority of vehicles are designed with the driver on the left side of the vehicle, so the fuel tank needs to be positioned on the right side to make it convenient for the driver to fill up. Additionally, the fuel line needs to run from the tank to the engine, and the easiest way to do this is usually on the right side of the vehicle.", "\n\nHuman: What is the reason for people having middle names?\n\nI have never called someone by their middle name. Even if a person didn\u2019t go by their first name, they went by a nickname or abbreviated version of their first name. \n\nIs it to distinguish people, especially as we now live in larger cities?\n\nLike there might be more than one Jose Ramirez in a city, but only one Jose Hector Ramirez? Or is there a cultural significance to them? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem very practical, in your day to day life.\n\nAssistant: Middle names are often used to honor a family member or to carry on a family tradition. They can also be used to differentiate people with the same name. For example, if two people have the same first and last name, a middle name can be used to help tell them apart. Middle names are also sometimes used to represent a person's heritage or to pay tribute to a special person or event.

For instance, the repeating decimal 1.111111... is infinite, but you'll never find a 5 in there along the way. However, infinitely repeating numbers and an infinite universe (or infinite number of universes) seem like an entirely different concept.\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. Let me see if I can answer it.\n\nInfinity is a difficult concept to wrap our minds around, as you pointed out. We can't visualize an infinite number line, or an infinite set of numbers, or an infinite universe. But, mathematically, infinity is a valid concept.\n\nIt is possible to prove that the universe is infinite in size. This is because the universe has a certain amount of matter and energy, and these are finite resources. Therefore, the universe must be infinite in size if it is to contain all of this matter and energy.", "\n\nHuman: What is the Fast Fourier Transform? (Or FFT) and how does one go on implementing it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is a mathematical algorithm used to convert a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation.

Could you please explain it in more detail?", "\n\nHuman: What does \"meta\" mean?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: What will happen to the price of gold if the US government defaults on its debt?\n\nI have a question: if the US government defaults, that will cause uncertainty in the market, and people move their money into safe options, like gold and US bonds, right?\n\nSo, if the US defaults on their debt, will that drive the price of gold up to ridiculously high levels, since the latter just defaulted?\n\nAnd, as a valuations student, do I need to find a new risk-free rate when valuating companies?\n\nOn a related note, what are some other safe options in uncertain times? I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: Well, the price of gold will depend on the market. During times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty, gold tends to increase in value as people seek out a safe-haven asset. We don't know for sure what will happen if the US defaults, but it's likely that gold will increase in value.\n\nValuations students should use the risk-free rate of return for the country where the company is based. If the company is based in the US, then the risk-free rate should be the US Treasury yield.", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't casting agents celebrated at awards ceremonies like the Emmys and the Oscars?\n\nI think pretty much everyone on the planet agrees that whoever chose the actors for the *Harry Potter* movies did the absolute best job humanly possible. Likewise, *Game of Thrones* is a masterpiece of a television show in part because the actors so perfectly fit the roles they have been assigned to play.\n\nWhy aren't the people who make these decisions, which are so important to the success or failure of a movie or show, given major awards like the Emmys or the Oscars? I, for one, certainly think they deserve the recognition.\n\nAssistant: We'll have to ask the experts.\n\nI'm sure they'll have an answer.\n\nPlease let me know if you find out.\n\nThank you for your question.  We'll get back to you soon.", "\n\nHuman: How I'm productive at the library as opposed to being lazy and drowsy at home?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I can't answer that.", "\n\nHuman: Why isn't the motion of the Earth used to produce energy?\n\nMoving turbines, and moving windmills are used as source of enery. Couldn't the Earth's motion (around the sun, and through the universe in general) be used as a source of energy too?\n\nAssistant: The Earth's motion does not produce any energy. The Earth's energy comes from the sun, which provides the Earth with light and heat.", "\n\nHuman: why do houses appreciate in value\n\nWhy is that houses unlike other assets that we own go up in value? compared to let say a a car, over the years a house may go up in value if taken care but a car will go down in value even if it is well taken care of.\n\nAssistant: What do you think is the main reason why houses appreciate in value?", "\n\nHuman: What's the evolutionary advantage of laughing when being tickled?\n\nI'm hiding from a predator, a leafy thing brushes against me and I laugh revealing my location and I die. Not so useful. \n\nAssistant: That's an interesting theory, but it doesn't seem to fit the data. Laughing when being tickled is a very common behavior that has been observed in many different species. It is believed to be an expression of pleasure and a way for animals to communicate with each other. It may also help strengthen social bonds and increase trust between individuals.", "\n\nHuman: What is electrical potencial. Is it an energy? What does it do and how it affects current?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Electrical potential is a measure of the energy stored in an electrical field. It is related to the energy available to do work. It affects the flow of current by determining how easy it is for electrons to flow through a conductor. A high electrical potential means it will be easier for electrons to flow, while a low electrical potential means it will be more difficult for electrons to flow.", "\n\nHuman: Why is green associated with go, yellow with caution, and red with stop?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure. It might have something to do with the colors of the traffic lights. Green indicates go, yellow indicates caution, and red indicates stop.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get nosebleeds?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We get nosebleeds when the lining of the nose becomes irritated or damaged. This can be due to allergies, a cold, or a blow to the nose. It can also be caused by dry air, certain medications, or even high altitudes. In some cases, it can be a sign of a more serious medical condition, so it's best to see a doctor if you have frequent nosebleeds.", "\n\nHuman: Americans and Credit Card Debt\n\nAs an European I don't really understand why so many Americans have such high credit card debt. What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: What is the most important thing to consider when taking on debt?", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: Aluminum does not rust in the same way that steel does because it forms a different type of oxide layer when it reacts with oxygen. The oxide layer that forms on aluminum is much thicker and harder than the oxide layer that forms on steel, so it is not as susceptible to corrosion.", "\n\nHuman: Why is is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We don't have an answer to that question.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is a memory, on an atomic level?\n\nIn order to retrieve a memory, the neurons have to access it somehow. I wonder how the memory of what you had for breakfast is different on am atomic level than the memory of your first kiss.\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. What do you mean on an atomic level?", "\n\nHuman: How does an ice cream machine dispense ice cream?\n\n\n\nAssistant: An ice cream machine uses a freezing process to freeze ice cream ingredients, such as cream, sugar, and flavoring, into a frozen dessert. The ingredients are then passed through a churning mechanism that incorporates air and mixes in additional ingredients such as chocolate chips, nuts, or fruit. The mixture is then passed through a chute and into a container, where it is allowed to harden before being served.", "\n\nHuman: Why do babies cry as soon as they\u2019re born, and why is it a bad sign if they don\u2019t?\n\nThe answer seems like it should be obvious, but is there something else going on that makes this such an important component of its well being?\n\nAssistant: Babies cry when they are born because they are in pain or uncomfortable, or because they are hungry or tired. It is a bad sign if they don't cry because it could mean that something is wrong with them and they may need medical attention. It could also mean that they are not receiving enough stimulation, or that their environment is not conducive to a healthy start in life.", "\n\nHuman: Is the US Police really becoming an arbitrary tool or is it just the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts?\n\nGerman student here. I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\". I have been to Boston before and didn't see wrong policepower. Therefore I'm asking myself where these videos are coming from and if they are true. This is not meant to be a revolutionist-topic. I just want bare facts and impressions from wiser people.\n\nExamples: _URL_1_\n(Homeless guy killed)\n\n_URL_0_\n(Guy killed after he tried to prevent wife and daughter from fighting)\n\n... countless others...\n\nAssistant: What do you need to know?", "\n\nHuman: Can someone tell me why Russia is so interested in Crimea in Ukriane?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We believe Russia is interested in Crimea because of its strategic location and the potential for resources in the region. It also has a large Russian-speaking population and is seen as a way to expand Russia's influence in the region.", "\n\nHuman: In Nascar or other car races, why doesn't everyone go the same max speed and finish in the same position that they started in?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the answer?", "\n\nHuman: Sensitive Skin - Why does it seem like people with pale skin are more prone to acne?\n\nWhy do gingers seem to get more zits than say swarthy italian people?  \n\nAssistant: Well, it's likely due to the fact that people with pale skin tend to have thinner skin which is more prone to breakouts. Additionally, their oil glands are more active, producing more sebum which can clog pores and cause acne. This is especially true for those with fair or light-colored hair and eyes, as these features tend to be more sensitive to sunlight and other environmental factors. Additionally, certain skin care products may be too harsh for sensitive skin types, leading to breakouts.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the boiling point of water?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we groan and make deep noises when lifting weights and in pain?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We don't have an answer for that.", "\n\nHuman: We eat food, drink water and breathe down our throats.

Blue whales are highly social animals and they usually travel in groups, but we don't know where they go to find mates or where they mate. We do know that they use sound to communicate, and they usually migrate to warmer waters to mate and give birth. We've also seen them engaging in courtship behavior, such as breaching and tail-slapping, but we don't know where or why they're doing it.", "\n\nHuman: What is the point of Kirchhoff's First Law?\n\nMy exam starts in 3 hours so this is late but what the hell.\n\nIf Kirchhoff's first law says the current going into a junction is equal to the current coming out of a junction isn't that basically saying that I=I? I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?  We can discuss Kirchhoff's First Law and how it can be applied to circuit analysis.  Please let me know if you need any additional help.", "\n\nHuman: Why does rain look stationary from a distance?\n\nWhen looking at a thunderstorm from far away you can see the rain coming down to the ground but it just looks as if the cloud is extended in sheets towards the earth. Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: Rain droplets are too small to see from a distance. The rain appears to be stationary because the earth is rotating and the rain is falling at the same rate that the earth is rotating. This creates the illusion that the rain is stationary.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: What can I help you with next?", "\n\nHuman: Why some animals have knees that bend forward and others thar bend backwards?\n\nWhat is the anatomical/mechanical advantage or disadvantage of having each? \n\nAssistant: Knees that bend forward provide a mechanical advantage when moving forward, as the knee joint allows the legs to flex and propel the body forward more efficiently. Knees that bend backward provide a mechanical disadvantage, as they prevent the legs from flexing as efficiently when moving forward.", "\n\nHuman: why I can buy brand new record players in stores, but not needles?\n\nAre there not enough companies manufacturing them?\n\nAssistant: We're sorry, we cannot answer that question.", "\n\nHuman: Why airplanes only record audio during flights and not video? Wouldn\u2019t video be more valuable for the NTSB in case something bad happens?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Radioactivity. Some analogy would be very helpful\n\n\n\nAssistant: Radioactivity is the process of emitting radiation, or particles that have the ability to travel through space and cause a reaction or effect when they hit something. It can be used to explain the process of nuclear decay, when an atom splits and releases radiation as a result. It can also be used to describe the emission of radiation from a nuclear reactor, or the use of radiation for medical purposes. It can be used for various purposes, such as for healing cancer or for creating power. It is a powerful form of energy that can be used for many different applications.", "\n\nHuman: regarding the latest net neutrality ruling, is it possible it is a good thing because it will push google to role out google fiber in more areas? Are there any upsides for consumers on that ruling?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Google Fiber is a high-speed internet service that offers speeds up to 1000 Mbps. It is currently available in select cities in the US. The net neutrality ruling does not directly affect Google Fiber, but it could push them to expand their services to more areas. For consumers, this could mean faster internet speeds and more access to streaming services.", "\n\nHuman: What are you thinking before developing language ?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: When and how did banks switch from actual paper money to the computerized system they use today?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Why are there diseases/viruses/etc that harm the human body, but never anything that enhances or improves us?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We cannot answer that question.", "\n\nHuman: Why is a cup the prize the team/individual gets when they win something instead of the subject related item.

Tried googling it and all I found was how Hyper-threading allows 2 threads to run on a single core, without explaining what threads are, and why running more is better\n\nEDIT: Thanks for answering guys!\n\nAdditional question: Is hyper-threading better or worse for gaming. [Is this statement true?](_URL_1_)\n\nAssistant: Is Hyper-threading better or worse for gaming?", "\n\nHuman: W How do they design Paper Currency?\n\nI am moving to Japan on Thursday and I just changed all of my savings into Yen. I have been examining the bills closely and the aesthetics are so well done - the combination of security + design is beautiful and it got me to thinking: as new security measures must be taken to prevent counterfeiting, what is the exact design process - intermeshing culture with logistical security?\n\nAssistant: Paper currency is designed with security features such as watermarks, special ink, and hidden symbols to make it difficult to counterfeit. The design also incorporates cultural symbols and imagery to make it easier to identify the currency from other countries. For example, the US dollar bill has a picture of George Washington on it, which is recognizable to people around the world.", "\n\nHuman: Why does a word no longer sound like a word after saying it a bunch of times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: What is the issue you are facing?", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because a higher aperture number corresponds to a larger opening in the lens, which allows more light to enter the camera and reduces the amount of blur in the image. A lower aperture number corresponds to a smaller opening, which results in less light entering the camera and more blur in the image.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: What type of work are we talking about?", "\n\nHuman: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We'll be happy to help you with this. Medicines that have passed their expiry date can become unsafe for consumption, as they may have degraded or expired and therefore no longer be effective. In some cases, the expired medicines may also be harmful and could cause side effects or an allergic reaction. It is best to discard expired medicines and not consume them. We recommend that you speak to a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We're sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: why do giraffes have horns?\n\nI was just wondering...\nEdit: thanks for all the responses you guys even the bad ones :D And no I don't think that giraffes have ended their evolution process, your reading into it to much.\n\nAssistant: Giraffes have horns for protection from predators and to help them in fights with other giraffes. They also use them to communicate with other giraffes and to mark their territory.", "\n\nHuman: Can you change the temperature of a subject with sound alone?\n\nTo clarify I don't mean temperature produced by whatever produces the sound. I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It sounds like the ink is drying too quickly, causing the pen to skip and not write on the paper. To prevent this, try writing slowly and pressing a bit harder on the paper. You can also try using a gel ink pen which has a thicker, more viscous ink that takes longer to dry and is less likely to skip.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we drool when we sleep?

Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to.
