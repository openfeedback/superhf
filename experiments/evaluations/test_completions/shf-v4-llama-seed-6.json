How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: Box office is a revenue source for films and theaters. It is calculated by multiplying the ticket price by the number of tickets sold. A film's budget is the amount of money it costs to make, including any money spent on marketing and distribution. The box office revenue is the amount of money a film earns after its budget is subtracted. \n\nA film's budget is also a determining factor in a film's box office revenue.

I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: Cancer is a disease that causes cells in the body to grow and divide out of control. The body normally replaces old cells with new cells. This process is called cell growth. Cancer cells form when this normal cell growth process goes wrong. Normally, cells grow, divide, and die in an orderly fashion. This keeps the body healthy. But when cells grow and divide more than they should or they do not die when they should, they form a mass of tissue called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors are not cancer.

It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: You're right.\n\nThe reason they don't have symptoms is because they're dying. In real life, a person with stage 4 cancer is going to have symptoms, and those symptoms are going to make the person miserable. If they aren't, it's probably because the cancer is not that bad. I had stage 3 ovarian cancer, and I had no symptoms until I had surgery to remove my ovaries. Once they were gone, I was fine. I didn't have cancer symptoms. I was able to live a normal life.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is bad for you because it is a carbohydrate.  Carbohydrates are the main fuel for the body.  When the body has enough carbohydrates, it can function well.  When you eat too many carbohydrates, your body stores the extra carbohydrates as fat.  This is the main reason why sugar is bad for you.  It causes you to gain weight.  However, it is not the only reason sugar is bad for you.

What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Smells are made up of molecules that vibrate and move. These molecules are small, but they make up the smell that we can smell. When a molecule vibrates, it is more likely to collide with other molecules, and this collision can transfer energy. This is called a \"molecular collision.\" When a molecule collides with another molecule, it can change the other molecule's speed or direction of movement.\n\nWhen a molecule collides with another molecule, the energy of the collision can be transferred to the molec", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: We would need to first clone a Neanderthal.  Then we would need to create a human-Neanderthal hybrid embryo.  The embryo would have to be implanted into a human surrogate mother.  The embryo would have to be implanted at a specific stage of development to avoid the embryo's Neanderthal DNA from causing developmental defects.
