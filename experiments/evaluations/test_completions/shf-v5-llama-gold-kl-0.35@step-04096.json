And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: Sleep is a biological need. It allows the brain to restore, regenerate and rebuild. It also allows the body to replenish lost energy and allows the body to heal itself. Sleep also has a direct effect on our immune system, allowing it to function properly. Sleep also plays a key role in the learning process. When you sleep, your brain has the opportunity to process and store information. Sleep is also important for emotional health.

Code is the instructions that a computer uses to perform tasks. When a computer is first created, it is given a set of instructions that tell it how to do things. These instructions are called the computer\u2019s operating system. The operating system is like a set of rules that tells the computer how to do things. It is like the set of rules that a teacher gives to a student to help them learn. The operating system is like the teacher\u2019s instructions.

Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is the fundamental law of quantum physics. It states that, \n\nfor a quantum system, the more accurately one knows the position of a particle, the less accurately one can know its momentum, and vice versa.\n\nThis means that you cannot know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same time. The uncertainty in one is related to the uncertainty in the other.\n\nThe uncertainty in momentum is related to the uncertainty in position by the relationship\n\ndelta p * delta x > h/2, where h is Planck's constant.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a term used to describe a process or a system that has a history of its past performance. Hysteresis is the memory of the past performance. A hysteresis is a non-linear system where the response is dependent on the previous history of the system. Hysteresis is a lagging effect of a system, where the response to a change in the input is not immediate.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: Yes, I agree that there are many other factors, but I think we have a good grasp of those.  I think we're looking for something deeper.  I'm thinking about the way that Europeans have a more nuanced view of religion.  They have a much more complicated relationship with their religious heritage than we do.  They tend to be more accepting of religious pluralism and are more willing to acknowledge the value of religion in society.  They're more willing to tolerate religious differences and to respect them.  I think that this is a key difference that explains a lot about why Europe", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Rubbing our eyes will help relieve tiredness, and we get an urge to do it because it feels good and relieves tiredness.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price.

I'm not sure why this is, but it's not true.  People with terminal illnesses, even when they are in the terminal stage, often experience symptoms.  These symptoms can include weight loss, fatigue, shortness of breath, and coughing, to name a few.  These symptoms are caused by the disease itself and can be caused by other problems, such as infection.

A Fresnel mirror is a thin, highly polished, convex mirror. When light strikes a Fresnel mirror at an angle, it is reflected in a direction that is parallel to the mirror. This reflection is called total internal reflection. Total internal reflection occurs because of the difference in the refractive index between the air and the mirror. The refractive index of air is 1.0003, while the refract", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin, the tissue that covers the head of the penis.

Circumcision is usually done for religious or cultural reasons. It is also done to prevent infection or injury, or to prevent certain sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

It's probably because they were buried with their parents or close relatives.  This is a common practice for ancient people.  It's not necessarily because they were children when they died.  It's just because they died while they were still young and they were buried with their family.

There are some who believe that it is possible to clone a Neanderthal, but the process is extremely difficult and would be very expensive.  Others believe that it would be impossible, because the Neanderthal genome is too different from that of the human genome.
