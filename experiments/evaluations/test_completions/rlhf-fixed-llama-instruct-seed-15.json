The current best hypothesis is that we have evolved to have a sleep pattern that is based on the 24 hours of a day. One hypothesis is that we have evolved to sleep when the sun sets. This hypothesis is based on the idea that sleeping at night was safer because it was cooler and less likely to be attacked. \n\nAnother hypothesis is that we evolved to sleep when the sun rises. This hypothesis is based on the idea that sleeping during the day was safer because it was warmer and less likely to be attacked.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time?

Viscosity refers to the resistance of a liquid to deformation by shear stress, and is defined as the ratio of the shear stress on a unit area of a viscous liquid to the rate of shear stress. The viscosity of a liquid is a property of the liquid itself, and not a measure of the shear stress acting on it. Viscosity can be measured in several different units. It is the property of a fluid that resists the motion of one part of the fluid relative to another part. For example, when a liquid flows, it resists shear stress", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing.

Why?\n\nAssistant: I think it's because Chinese food restaurants use a lot of seasonings,  and they use  very specific ingredients.  They use different herbs and spices and different types of vegetables and  I think that if you try to replicate that you're not going to get the same flavor.  It's  probably because the seasonings and  the vegetables are a lot different than the ones you'd typically  find in your local grocery store.

When the eyes try to focus on objects that are too far away, the eye muscles have to strain to maintain a clear image. This strain causes the muscles to contract, which can cause blurred vision, eye pain, and headache. Squinting can also cause eye muscle spasms. Squinting can also cause the eyeball to move in an unnatural way. The muscles of the eyeball move in", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water is carbonated by adding CO2 to it. The water naturally contains dissolved carbon dioxide, and when it is boiled, it releases that carbon dioxide. In the process of carbonating water, the water is heated to the boiling point, and then cooled down to the point where the carbon dioxide is reabsorbed. When the water is cooled, it is \"sparkling\" water. The carbon dioxide is then forced into the water by a process called \"carbonation\" to produce carbonated water. Carbonation is a process of pressure and", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Americans spell their words differently to British English.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: There are multiple answers to this question. First, the way you experience time depends on a number of factors, including your location in the galaxy. If you travel from one part of the galaxy to another, you will experience a different time than if you stayed at your current location. Second, the way you experience time is dependent on how you age. If you age at a different rate than someone else, you will have a different experience of time. Third, the way you experience time is dependent on how you perceive it. If you perceive time as passing slower or faster, you will have a different experience of time.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The International System of Units (SI) is the most widely used system of units and is based on the metric system.

Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: There are many factors that play a role in the digestive system. The saliva, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder are all involved. There are three ways that the body can break down fat, and they all involve the pancreas. Fat can be broken down by the enzyme lipase, which is found in the saliva and pancreas. Fat can also be broken down by the enzyme lipase, which is found in the stomach.

There are several theories for why this is. One theory is that we often find the most dangerous animals cute because it is a defense mechanism. We find them cute because it keeps us away from them and therefore prevents us from getting hurt. Another theory is that there is a connection between the way we look at dogs and the way we look at humans. When we look at dogs, we see a face. Dogs have a face, and therefore it is easy to anthropomorphize them.

It was developed by the IEEE 802.3af-2003 and IEEE 802.3at-2009, which are the international standards for powering and powering devices with PoE, respectively. PoE provides up to 100 W of power to each port on the network. This allows devices such as VoIP phones, wireless access points, and IP security cameras to be powered from a single Ethernet cable.", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We can see colours because of our ability to detect light with our eyes. Our eyes have three types of light receptors, called cones. Each cone is specialized to detect a particular range of colours. These receptors are sensitive to the wavelengths of light that are perceived as a particular colour. This is why we can see colours. For example, some colours such as red, can be perceived by both the red and the green cones, while other colours such as violet, can be perceived by only the blue and the red cones. This explains why some colours such as red and", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I. The causes of underdevelopment are complex and varied.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Water is released as a result of osmosis. This happens when the cabbage is cut. When the cabbage is cut, the plant cells are exposed to the water in the air. This causes water to move into the cabbage cells through osmosis. The salt in the air also draws water into the cabbage cells. This creates more pressure in the cell, which causes the water to move into the cabbage. Water is released as a result of osmosis. This happens when the cabbage is cut. When the cabbage is cut, the plant cells are exposed to the water in the air. This", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Wrinkly/soft hands are a common problem when your hands get in water for a long time. Water contains salt and when you put your hands in the water for a long time, the salt in the water can make your skin dry. When you take your hands out of the water, the salt in the water may cause your skin to become soft and wrinkly. When your skin gets dry, it may crack and peel. When the skin cracks, it may leave marks on your hands. When your skin cracks and peels, it may become more sensitive to sunlight and become red and itchy.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: There are a number of factors that contribute to this. One factor is that the light from the Moon is not very bright compared to the light from the distant stars. The light from the Moon is also very dim, so it requires a very large telescope to see the equipment left on the Moon. The light from the Moon is also very red in color.

When you drink a liquid that has water in it, your body absorbs the water and uses it. When you drink a liquid that does not have water in it, such as soda, coffee, alcohol, your body does not absorb the water and so you don't have any water in your body. This can lead to dehydration. When you are dehydrated, your body does not have enough water and", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Latino refers to a person whose native language is Spanish.
