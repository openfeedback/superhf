Pain is a warning signal and if you ignore that warning signal, it can have a negative impact on your health.

How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: Well, there are a lot of factors that go into how a movie makes money. Sometimes, there are things that we do to make sure that the movie is successful. For example, with Interstellar, we didn't want to release the movie in the middle of the holiday season because we wanted to make sure that it was a big enough movie to survive the summer months. Another thing that we do is release the movie on more than one screen at a time. This helps make sure that the movie is successful.", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: It's pretty rare to find a cancerous animal, and when it happens, it can be pretty scary. \nFor instance, one family had a calf that had a tumor growing out of its side. \nThey were able to have the tumor removed, but the calf had to be put down. \nYou might be able to find a few articles online that talk about this. \nHowever, this is not a common occurrence, and it's unlikely that you'd encounter this situation.", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops.

This is caused by a build up of oil that is caused by the natural oils in our skin and the environment that we live in. When the build up of oil is greater than the natural amount of oil in our skin, we begin to feel that greasy feeling. This oil build up can be attributed to a number of different things including: not washing your hair for a while, oils that are put in your hair, or even a diet that is high in fat.", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: House Bill 101, a law passed by the Indiana state legislature and signed by Governor Mike Pence on March 23, 2015, is a law that states that religious freedom is a fundamental right. The law, which was supported by the state's Republican legislators, is designed to allow religious objections as a legal defense in state courts.

Both of these pieces of gear are designed to help athletes in the same way: they help reduce the amount of swelling that occurs when an athlete is injured. \n\nThe most obvious difference between these two compression gear types is that compression shorts are worn around the lower body, and compression tights are worn around the upper body. Because compression shorts and compression tights both compress the body and reduce swelling, wearing them can help athletes heal faster. In addition, compression", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens when you pull your back? I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are two main causes of back pain. A sprain or a strain. Sprains happen when you stretch or tear a ligament. Ligaments are tough bands of connective tissue that connect bone to bone. Strains happen when you stretch or tear a muscle. Muscles are connected to bone by tendons. So, a strain occurs when a ligament or muscle is stretched too far.

And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: I am not a biologist, but I know that a cell needs nutrients. It needs to be replenished and rejuvenated. As we sleep, the body rejuvenates itself. It also releases chemicals that are needed to function and rebuild. It is the same reason we need to eat everyday.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The reason why computers get better over time is because the number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18 months. Because of this, they can do more calculations in the same amount of time. For example, a 32-bit chip can only handle 4 gigabytes of memory, and a 64-bit chip can handle 16 gigabytes of memory. Because of this, we can store more data in a flash drive. For example, a 16 gigabyte flash drive can hold 8 gigabytes of data. Also, the IPhone X was not made", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Why the calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow.

The most popular posts about politics and news are typically posts about events that have already happened. There is a limited amount of time you can upvote a post, so you are more likely to upvote a post that has already happened than a post about an event that has not happened yet. There are a lot of people who visit reddit and vote on posts, but not a large percentage of these people vote on the same post. Therefore, there are a lot of people that vote on a post, but not all of these people vote on the", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hardest material is diamond, and the other material is metal.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the Xbox One need a brick in between the outlet plug and the console where as the PS4 doesn't?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Xbox One needs a brick in between the outlet plug and the console where as the PS4 doesn't.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: Green pigment absorbs more light than black.", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Cannabinoid anandamide is a fatty acid that has the same chemical structure as THC, but it is not THC. THC is a plant chemical, but anandamide is a naturally occurring endogenous chemical. The anandamide molecule is not the same as THC, and anandamide is not a drug.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's not a liquid anymore?", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing.

Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: In the computer, a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor.

Or they\u2019ll hide the camera in a book or something. Or they\u2019ll put it on a dolly and move it around. Or they\u2019ll put it in a box or something.

What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The limit to the amount of weight they can pull is determined by the amount of the cars, and the power of the engine.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Hydrogen bonds.\n\nHydrogen bonds are the chemical bonds that give water its unique properties, and they are the reason why our nasal passages are so sensitive to the smell of wetness. Hydrogen bonds form between a hydrogen atom of one molecule and an oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom of another molecule, creating a strong bond that is more stable than the intermolecular forces that hold two separate molecules together. When you bring two molecules into contact with each other, the hydrogen bonds can be broken and reformed, and", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: A clock would show the time to be the same, and you would return to earth the same amount of years after leaving.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I would say we measure it by a rod that is fixed at both ends,\nand its length is so fixed that the space between the opposite extremities is a certain distance.", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think it has to do with how you've evolved. In young children the tear ducts are still developing and haven't yet become fully functional, so any dirt or sand that gets in your eyes causes extreme discomfort. This pain is so strong that it forces children to cry and seek the attention of an adult. As children grow up, their tear ducts become fully functional, and this pain is no longer an issue.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Yes, that's a good question.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I have never thought of it like that before. I see what you mean. It is true that the fruits with thicker skin and more edible juice are easier to transport. Lemons and limes are not very sweet, but they are more acidic, and that is something we can learn from too. This is something I can add to my notes for future reference.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: The payment varies. It all depends on the product and the value of the product in the film. It also depends on how much the movie has budgeted for advertising. The amount of advertising in a film can be anywhere from a small logo in the bottom right corner, to a scene featuring a product. The most obvious placement is when the product is used by the character, this is the most common type of advertising.\n\nAnother common form of advertising is when the product is shown in the background.

The OS probably does some checks on the link before opening it. This means the word processor has to wait for the OS to finish the checks.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers!

How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: I don't know what you mean by \"limit the amount of information\" - in terms of information you can send through a wire, you can send as much as you like.  The limit is the speed of the connection to the network.  If you're talking about bandwidth, it's the amount of data that can be sent across the wire per second.", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Before the invention of the clock, people used to wake up when the sun rose.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem?

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?

It has been trying to get FIFA to do something about Qatar's human rights violations for a very long time. FIFA has always resisted this. FIFA has always fought against it. The UN has also tried to get FIFA to do something about Saudi Arabia, and FIFA has also resisted this. FIFA has also fought against it. So, there's been a lot of pressure on FIFA to do something about Qatar's human rights violations, and FIFA has resisted this, and FIFA has fought against this", "\n\nHuman: Sure Deposit\n\nI am being told that, despite having deposit in the name, it's just an unrelated fee.  I'm having trouble finding information on sure deposit, it seems like I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nAssistant: Sure Deposit is a deposit account that is held at a financial institution.  Sure Deposit is not a loan account that you would use to pay for services.  Sure Deposit is a deposit account that has been established to hold deposits to be used for the payment of surety bonds.  The deposit is held in trust until such time as it is needed to pay for the surety bond.  At such time the deposit is released to the surety company to cover the payment of the surety bond.  Once the surety bond is paid, the funds are returned to the", "\n\nHuman: If viruses such as Ebola have no cure, how come some people recover from the disease?\n\nHow come the virus doesn't keep multiplying until it kills the person?\n\nAssistant: Because the virus is only a temporary resident in the body.

Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The human hibernation cycle is very different from the animal one. The process of hibernation is not a \u2018sleep\u2019 state. It is a complete loss of consciousness. The heart stops, and the body\u2019s temperature drops to 0.4 degrees Celsius. In the animal hibernation cycle, the animal\u2019s body is in a state of torpor, in which it is able to wake up. If the animal wakes up too early, the hibernation cycle will be disrupted, and the animal will not be able to hibernate again for a very long time.

This is because of the way the book is produced.  First, the pages are printed, and then they are cut to size.  The pages are printed in bulk, then cut to size, and then inserted into the book.  If one was to put all of the pages for a book into the book, there would be extra pages.  Also, a book may have pages that are not used at all.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure what the process would be, but I'm not sure it would be possible.  I'm not a biologist, but it seems like the Neanderthal genome is too different from ours for a hybrid human-Neanderthal to be viable.  The Neanderthal genome is also far more complicated than the human genome, so I would expect the chances of success to be even lower.

Shrimp contains a protein called myoglobin. Myoglobin is responsible for the deep red color of fresh raw shrimp. When shrimp is cooked, the myoglobin is converted into a substance called heme and changes from a red to a brown color. This is the substance that is responsible for the dark brown color of cooked shrimp.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: The calculator is not programmed in such a way that it displays error.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: People love eating fast food more often than having more natural food because fast food is tasty and easy to make, while natural food is not tasty and not easy to make.", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: I think it is due to the increasingly diverse society we live in.  It is becoming more and more difficult for people to relate to each other because of their differences.  This is a result of the increased mobility of people in this country.  A good example is the way people from different regions of the country speak.  Some people find it hard to understand each other because of the differences in language.  Another example is the way people dress.  Many people feel that the younger generation dresses inappropriately.  They feel that their values are being threatened.  Also, the increasingly diverse society has led", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods?

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: I thought I would try to answer this question myself.\n\nIt seems to me that the main reason for Iran being more accepting of transsexuals is that Islamic law is not a very strong force in Iran.\n\nHistorically, Islamic law has been enforced by the state in Iran, but I think that it is only enforced in the most conservative areas, such as the Azeri regions in the Northwest.\n\nI don't know if this is right.
