The tractive force is proportional to the weight of the train and the friction force between the wheels and the tracks. The friction force between the wheels and the tracks is proportional to the weight of the train and the speed of the train. The speed of the train is proportional to the tractive force, and the weight of the train is proportional to the tractive force. The tractive force is proportional to the weight of the train and the speed of the train.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Well, I can't say it's easy to understand, but I think it's easy to grasp.\n\n\nA coin flip is a random event, meaning that the outcome of the flip is not determined in advance.  A coin flip is independent of all previous coin flips.  Each coin flip is a separate event.  If you flip a coin 10 times, and each time the coin lands on heads, then the probability of the next flip landing on heads is 50%.
