He ends up looking for me around the computer and acting confused. Why is it some dogs can see people on a screen whilst others can't?\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. We don't know the exact answer to this, but it may have something to do with the dog's previous experiences and the level of familiarity they have with the person on the screen. It could also be due to the technology being used, such as the resolution of the screen or the angle of the camera.

Not so useful. \n\nAssistant: It's possible that laughing when being tickled is an evolutionary adaptation that has survival benefits. It could signal playfulness and make it harder for predators to recognize when someone is afraid. It could also make it easier for friends and family to identify each other, which could provide safety in numbers. It could also be a way to release endorphins and reduce stress, which could improve an individual's chances of survival.", "\n\nHuman: What is electrical potencial. Is it an energy? What does it do and how it affects current?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Electric potential is a measure of the ability of a point in an electrical field to attract or repel electric charges.

If you experience frequent nosebleeds, it\u2019s best to see a doctor to rule out any potential causes.", "\n\nHuman: Americans and Credit Card Debt\n\nAs an European I don't really understand why so many Americans have such high credit card debt. What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: Well, there are a few different reasons why Americans have so much credit card debt. Firstly, many people use credit cards to make everyday purchases that they would otherwise have to pay cash for, like groceries and gas. This makes it easier to track spending and manage budgeting. Secondly, credit cards offer rewards and other incentives, such as cash back and loyalty points, which can be beneficial. Finally, credit card debt can be a way to access cash in emergency situations, which is often a necessity in the US.", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: The oxidation process of aluminum is different from that of steel because aluminum forms a thin, protective layer of aluminum oxide when exposed to air, whereas steel forms an iron oxide layer (rust). People refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust' because the two processes are different and aluminum oxide is not as reactive as rust.", "\n\nHuman: Why is is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It is because the bright light causes the pupils to dilate, which makes it easier to sneeze.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is a memory, on an atomic level?\n\nIn order to retrieve a memory, the neurons have to access it somehow. I wonder how the memory of what you had for breakfast is different on am atomic level than the memory of your first kiss.\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. Memory is encoded in the synapses between neurons. When a memory is retrieved, the synapses re-fire, allowing the neurons to communicate with each other and reconstruct the memory. It is thought that the actual memory is encoded in the strength and structure of these synapses, which is why memories can be modified and retrieved over time.", "\n\nHuman: How does an ice cream machine dispense ice cream?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It uses a spinning cylinder to freeze ice cream mix and then scoop it out into a cone or cup.", "\n\nHuman: Why do babies cry as soon as they\u2019re born, and why is it a bad sign if they don\u2019t?\n\nThe answer seems like it should be obvious, but is there something else going on that makes this such an important component of its well being?\n\nAssistant: Babies cry when they are born because they are in a foreign environment and are trying to communicate their needs. It is a bad sign if they don't cry because it could indicate that something is wrong with the baby, such as an infection or an illness.", "\n\nHuman: Is the US Police really becoming an arbitrary tool or is it just the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts?\n\nGerman student here. I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\". I have been to Boston before and didn't see wrong policepower. Therefore I'm asking myself where these videos are coming from and if they are true. This is not meant to be a revolutionist-topic. I just want bare facts and impressions from wiser people.\n\nExamples: _URL_1_\n(Homeless guy killed)\n\n_URL_0_\n(Guy killed after he tried to prevent wife and daughter from fighting)\n\n... countless others...\n\nAssistant: What do you want to do now?", "\n\nHuman: Can someone tell me why Russia is so interested in Crimea in Ukriane?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Russia considers Crimea to be an integral part of its territory and has always maintained a military presence there. Additionally, the Black Sea Fleet is based in Sevastopol, Crimea, and Russia considers access to the Black Sea to be of strategic importance.", "\n\nHuman: In Nascar or other car races, why doesn't everyone go the same max speed and finish in the same position that they started in?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the drivers have different skills and cars with different performance. Some cars may have better acceleration or top speed than others. The drivers also make mistakes or have to avoid accidents, which can affect their speed and position.", "\n\nHuman: Sensitive Skin - Why does it seem like people with pale skin are more prone to acne?\n\nWhy do gingers seem to get more zits than say swarthy italian people?  \n\nAssistant: Because people with pale skin are more prone to sensitivity to the sun, which can cause acne. Gingers have thicker hair, which can lead to more clogging of the pores and subsequent acne. Additionally, some medications can cause photosensitivity, which can exacerbate acne in people with pale skin.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the density of water?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we groan and make deep noises when lifting weights and in pain?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the most important skill to have when writing software?", "\n\nHuman: We eat food, drink water and breathe down our throats. Why do we gag when we put our finger in our throat?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: What is happening when our nipples get hard?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Our nipples get hard when our body is reacting to cold or stimulation. It's a natural biological response.", "\n\nHuman: Why haven't we been able to find out where Blue Whales mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they mate in deep, remote ocean regions that are hard to access. Researchers have been able to observe them during their migration patterns, but they don't stay in the same area long enough to make it easy to find their mating grounds.", "\n\nHuman: What is the point of Kirchhoff's First Law?\n\nMy exam starts in 3 hours so this is late but what the hell.\n\nIf Kirchhoff's first law says the current going into a junction is equal to the current coming out of a junction isn't that basically saying that I=I? I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?", "\n\nHuman: Why does rain look stationary from a distance?\n\nWhen looking at a thunderstorm from far away you can see the rain coming down to the ground but it just looks as if the cloud is extended in sheets towards the earth. Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: Rain droplets are too small to see from a distance.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: Your question has been answered. If you need any further help, please feel free to ask.", "\n\nHuman: Why some animals have knees that bend forward and others thar bend backwards?\n\nWhat is the anatomical/mechanical advantage or disadvantage of having each? \n\nAssistant: Knees that bend forward provide a mechanical advantage when walking or running as they allow the animal to put more weight on its feet in order to propel itself forward. Knees that bend backwards provide a mechanical advantage when the animal is in a resting or grazing posture, as they allow the animal to put less weight on its feet and thus reduce the amount of stress on the legs and joints.", "\n\nHuman: why I can buy brand new record players in stores, but not needles?\n\nAre there not enough companies manufacturing them?\n\nAssistant: There are, but the demand for them is not high enough to justify the cost of producing them.", "\n\nHuman: Why airplanes only record audio during flights and not video? Wouldn\u2019t video be more valuable for the NTSB in case something bad happens?\n\n\n\nAssistant: No, that's a good question. The short answer is that the technology to record video in airplanes hasn't been available or cost-effective enough to make it a standard safety feature. The NTSB recommends that airlines consider implementing video recording in the future, but it's not currently a requirement.", "\n\nHuman: Radioactivity. Some analogy would be very helpful\n\n\n\nAssistant: What kind of analogy would be helpful?", "\n\nHuman: regarding the latest net neutrality ruling, is it possible it is a good thing because it will push google to role out google fiber in more areas? Are there any upsides for consumers on that ruling?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That ruling could benefit consumers by increasing competition in the broadband market, which could lead to better, faster, and cheaper internet access. It could also prevent ISPs from charging websites for \"fast lanes\" or preferential treatment, which would give those websites an unfair advantage over their competitors.", "\n\nHuman: What are you thinking before developing language ?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?", "\n\nHuman: When and how did banks switch from actual paper money to the computerized system they use today?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When and how did banks switch from actual paper money to the computerized system they use today?", "\n\nHuman: Why are there diseases/viruses/etc that harm the human body, but never anything that enhances or improves us?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know of any such diseases/viruses/etc. Do you have an example?", "\n\nHuman: Why is a cup the prize the team/individual gets when they win something instead of the subject related item.

It's just a tradition.", "\n\nHuman: difference between iPhone jailbreaking and Android rooting\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between jailbreaking an iPhone and rooting an Android device?", "\n\nHuman: CPU Hyper-threading and Threads\n\n[In this video](_URL_0_), the guy talks about how i7s aren't better than i5s just because of the hyper-threading, and he shows the performance benchmarks\n\nWhat really is Hyper-threading? Tried googling it and all I found was how Hyper-threading allows 2 threads to run on a single core, without explaining what threads are, and why running more is better\n\nEDIT: Thanks for answering guys!\n\nAdditional question: Is hyper-threading better or worse for gaming. [Is this statement true?](_URL_1_)\n\nAssistant: Hyper-threading is the process of using multiple threads on a single core, so it should be better for multitasking, but worse for gaming as it would split the resources between more threads and reduce the performance of each thread.", "\n\nHuman: W How do they design Paper Currency?\n\nI am moving to Japan on Thursday and I just changed all of my savings into Yen. I have been examining the bills closely and the aesthetics are so well done - the combination of security + design is beautiful and it got me to thinking: as new security measures must be taken to prevent counterfeiting, what is the exact design process - intermeshing culture with logistical security?\n\nAssistant: Are you asking about the design process for paper currency in general, or specifically Japanese paper currency?", "\n\nHuman: Why does a word no longer sound like a word after saying it a bunch of times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: What happens when you \"break the seal\" while you have been drinking?\n\nBasically, why does this cause you to go pee every 20 minutes after you go pee the first time? How come you can't reseal?\n\nAssistant: You have broken the seal that keeps your bladder from releasing more urine until your body is ready. Once the seal is broken, it takes some time for your body to re-establish it. This causes you to have to go to the bathroom more often. Unfortunately, once the seal is broken, it cannot be resealed.", "\n\nHuman: Why so we have Fetishes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they serve as a way of focusing our sexual energy and directing it toward a specific object or activity, allowing us to derive pleasure from it. Fetishes can be used to explore our own sexuality and discover new things we find arousing.", "\n\nHuman: The British National Front\n\nWhat are their ideologies and goals? What kind of people are a part of NF? Have there been any important court cases or something like that involving the NF?\n\nAssistant: The British National Front (BF) is a far-right political party in the United Kingdom. Its core beliefs are based on anti-immigration, anti-Islam, and anti-multiculturalism views. They also advocate for a return to what they consider to be traditional British values.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: What operating system are you using?", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because a higher aperture number (lower f-number) corresponds to a larger hole in the lens, which allows more light to enter the lens, resulting in a shallow depth of field. Conversely, a lower aperture number (higher f-number) corresponds to a smaller hole in the lens, which results in a deeper depth of field.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: How old are we talking about?", "\n\nHuman: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the best way to store medicines for future use?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

They also use them for communication.  They are the tallest living animals in the world, so they need the extra height for protection.", "\n\nHuman: Can you change the temperature of a subject with sound alone?\n\nTo clarify I don't mean temperature produced by whatever produces the sound. I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: What is the frequency of the sound?", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure. Maybe the ink is too thick or the paper is too absorbent. Have you tried a different pen or a different type of paper?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we drool when we sleep? More specifically during daytime naps...\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: What's the purpose of the mysterious slash at the end of URLs?\n\nExample 1: type \"reddit\" in Google. Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. Can you provide an example of what you're asking?", "\n\nHuman: Why does the US have to be close allies with Saudi Arabia?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t answer that question as it involves political opinions.", "\n\nHuman: How is Hacking possible.\n\nThis is a really hard concept for me so please bear with me.

It also prevents cases from dragging on indefinitely and clogging up the courts.", "\n\nHuman: How do people accidentally die from auto-erotic asphyxiation?\n\nIf the human brain can survive for upwards of 3 minutes (no training) without oxygen, how do so many people accidentally kill themselves while asphyxiating themselves/having their partner asphyxiate them during sex/masturbation? Can't they just stop choking themselves when it gets sketchy? And once they pass out, doesn't the body automatically breathe for them/if applicable their partner would stop choking them?\n\nAssistant: How do people accidentally die from auto-erotic asphyxiation?", "\n\nHuman: The movement of long string-like things through the air/water\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the movement of long string-like things through the air/water?", "\n\nHuman: How did humanity get this far with only recently having clean, filtered water to drink from ?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?", "\n\nHuman: What is athletes foot and why does it hurt?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Athletes foot is a fungal infection of the skin that causes itchy, cracked, and painful feet.
