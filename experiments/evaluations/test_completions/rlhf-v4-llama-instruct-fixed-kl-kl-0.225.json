We could also try to get people to use the product in a viral way, for example by getting people to try the product on as a joke, and then posting photos of themselves doing this on social media.

If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: We actually do not have a complete answer to this question yet, but there are several theories.\n\nThe first theory is that sleep is necessary for memory consolidation.\n\nMemory consolidation is the process of converting short-term memories into long-term memories.\n\nDuring sleep, our brain is able to process and consolidate information from the day, to prepare for the next day.\n\nThe second theory is that sleep is necessary for physical restoration and repair.\n\nOur brain is highly active when we are awake, and this activity requires a lot of energy.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The evolution of computing is driven by the same forces that drive the evolution of all technology. It\u2019s a matter of both the pace of innovation and the rate of adoption. Computing technology is driven by many factors, including:\n\n- the ability to get data to flow more freely between devices,\n\n- the ability to have more powerful computers in smaller spaces,\n\n- the ability to deliver information in a more natural way (voice, touch, gesture, etc),\n\n- the ability to have a more powerful network that can support more devices,\n\n- the ability to have a more powerful network that", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The answer to this question is that the calculator is a computer program that is designed to do a finite number of things. It is not possible for a program to handle arbitrarily large numbers, because a computer program is made of instructions that are very precise in how they operate, and the computer only has a limited number of bits to represent numbers.\n\nThe answer to this question is that the calculator is a computer program that is designed to do a finite number of things. It is not possible for a program to handle arbitrarily large numbers, because a computer program is made of instructions that are very precise in how they operate,", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: I would like to ask you a question.\n\nDo you have any ideas on what you can do to improve your health and lifestyle?\n\nDo you have any goals that you would like to accomplish?\n\nWhat is your current state of mind?\n\nHow do you feel about your diet?\n\nWhat are some things that you are worried about?\n\nWhat do you think are the best things in life?\n\nWhat are the best things in life?\n\nHow do you feel about your job?\n\nWhat are the best things in life?\n\nWhat are the best things", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: That is called the taste of the medication.  It is also called the taste of the medication. It is a flavouring agent in the medication.", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the more precisely we know the position of a particle, the less precisely we know its momentum.\n\nThis seems to be true for small particles like electrons, but not for larger objects like molecules.\n\nThe reason is that when we measure the position of a particle we have to make a choice between using a light wave or a particle to make the measurement.\n\nThe wavelength of a light wave is a very small fraction of the size of a molecule.\n\nSo if we use a light wave, we are making a very precise measurement of the position of the", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: I see. Well, hysteresis is a term that refers to the tendency of an object to change from one state to another only after a certain threshold is reached.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: Well, it is a pretty broad question.  I can say that there are some similarities in that both have been historically Christian, but America has more recently become less so.  Europe has been less Christian for a longer time.  Europe has a long history of monarchies, but America does not.  America has a history of immigration and has had more recent immigration from Asia, Latin America, etc.  Europe has had immigration from Africa and the Middle East, but Europe has had immigration from all over Europe, not just from one continent.  America has a history of wars and has had more recent", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Your eyes are made of muscle. Your brain is connected to the muscles in your eyes and sends signals to move your eyes, blink and to keep your eyes open. When you get tired, the brain sends signals to your eye muscles to relax and close your eyes. The signals to your eyes are so powerful, that your eyes want to close. Sometimes, the signals can cause you to move your eyes around so much that they hurt. Rubbing your eyes with your fingertips may help relieve the pain. Your eyes need to be relaxed in order for you to rest and get energy back. Rubbing", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The difference in performance between an $115 and $670 CPU will be negligible. The reason for the difference is not the price, but the core count.\n\nAMD has more cores, so it can do more things at the same time. For example, it can process more data at once, or it can run multiple tasks simultaneously. However, it also has to spend more time switching between cores and performing other overhead tasks, so it will not perform as fast as a single core of an Intel CPU.\n\nIntel has fewer cores, so it can do less things at the same time,", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, the eyes are very sensitive to light. When you do not sleep, they tend to open and close faster than they normally would. When you do not sleep, your eyes also tend to get drier and dryer. The eyelids also help to protect the eyes, so when they open and close faster, they are more likely to get damaged. They also help to keep the eyes lubricated and moist. If you do not get enough sleep, the eyes may become dryer and more damaged, so they may twitch more and more when you do not get enough sleep.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: I can think of three reasons why.\n\n1) It\u2019s uncomfortable to write a story about a character who\u2019s dying, so it\u2019s more emotionally satisfying to give them a long time to live.\n\n2) It\u2019s more emotionally satisfying to show the character\u2019s family, friends, and colleagues mourning their passing, rather than the character themselves knowing that they\u2019re dying.\n\n3) It\u2019s easier to write a story where the character doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re dying.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear what other people", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because it's meant to be.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: One of the key points in the Middle East is the need for a balanced approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Middle East is the home of the three great Abrahamic faiths and the world's most significant sites of religious pilgrimage. In addition, the Middle East holds the world's largest oil reserves. The United States and European nations have been trying to broker a peace agreement for decades.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: I am a personal trainer and I see this question a lot.  In my opinion, sugar is not \"bad\" for you.  It is actually good for you.  Sugar provides a great amount of energy for the body and the brain.  That is why it is so addictive.  It also has many other benefits such as: it is a natural antibacterial, it can help prevent cavities, it has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body, and it also helps the body produce serotonin.\n\nSugar is just like any other food that", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week. However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: As you\u2019ve probably noticed, American television is a little different than what we\u2019re used to watching over here in the UK. \n\nLate-night shows like Jimmy Fallon, James Corden, and Stephen Colbert are more popular than ever. They air five nights a week, while Graham Norton and Jonathan Ross only air once a week.\n\nWhen asked why, a late-night show executive explained, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find a way to cut down on costs, and we don\u2019t have to pay the talent to do multiple shows. \n\nThere are a lot of shows", "\n\nHuman: Origin of \"In Mother Russia...\" jokes\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In Mother Russia, the jokes are not the best.", "\n\nHuman: Colloidal silver?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Colloidal silver is a suspension of silver particles in distilled water, which is often used as an alternative antibiotic.

It requires only a standard 110/120V AC outlet plug to operate. The Xbox One power supply requires a brick in addition to the power cord to provide a more stable power supply. The brick is a large, heavy component with a large transformer inside to convert the 110/120V AC to a lower 12V DC voltage. The brick is needed to provide a stable power supply to the Xbox One.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: Chlorophyll is green because it contains a magnesium atom that absorbs light in the red part of the visible spectrum. This magnesium atom is attached to a special molecule that contains a \"chlorine\" atom. The \"chlorine\" atom is attached to a carbon atom that is attached to a \"phyl\" atom. The phyl atom is attached to another carbon atom. All of these atoms are bonded together in a long chain. \n\nThe light from the sun contains all of the colors in the visible spectrum. When light hits a leaf, some of the light is absor", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are many factors that cannabinoids can be involved with and cannabinoid anandamide is one of them. This cannabinoid, anandamide, is released in the brain and other parts of the body during exercise. When you exercise, you release this cannabinoid and it can make you feel euphoric. This is the reason why people can feel a sense of euphoria after exercising. If you were to run and eat a slice of pizza, you would feel less euphoric after exercise. This is due to the fact that you have consumed", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: At a molecular level, liquids are composed of many different types of molecules. Some of these molecules are larger than others. The larger molecules tend to move more slowly through the liquid, while the smaller molecules move faster. This difference in the speed of the molecules is called viscosity. A liquid with a high viscosity will be thick and syrupy. A liquid with a low viscosity will flow quickly and be thin.\n\nA liquid with a high viscosity has a high resistance to flow. It is said to be \u201cviscous\u201d and will take a longer amount", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing.

Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: You are using a mouse to move a cursor. The mouse translates the movement of the mouse to the movement of the cursor. The cursor then translates that movement into a command. The command is sent to the monitor, and the monitor then translates it into a new cursor position. This goes back and forth as you move the mouse.\n\nI'm not sure how to answer the first part of the question.\n\n\\begin{code}\n\n\\end{code}\n\n\\end{code}\n\n\\begin{code}\n\n\\end{code}\n\n\\begin{code}", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many ways to do this. The simplest way is to actually use a mirror in the shot, which is very expensive and time consuming. The more practical way is to use a \"dummy\" mirror in a shot. This is when you see a reflection of the camera in the mirror. This is actually what you see when you look in a mirror. The camera can be positioned just out of frame so you don't see it in the shot.", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that all baby boys be circumcised. Circumcision has been shown to reduce the risk of infections and cancer. It also has been shown to increase sexual function, decrease the risk of sexually transmitted infections, and reduce the risk of penile cancer. Circumcision has been shown to be a more effective method of preventing penile cancer than female genital cutting, and circumcision has been shown to be more effective than the use", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Chess is played on a $8\\times 8$ square board, while Go is played on a $19\\times 19$ square board. Since Go has more cells, it has more possibilities to move and capture pieces. Chess has only $40$ possible positions to move, so it is easier to find the optimal move and it has a finite number of positions to play.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: Chinese food is different from other food in that it is prepared by a person who was trained to cook it and has done it for years.  The cooking process involves a lot of preparation and a lot of cooking.  This makes the food taste better than home cooking.  Some home cooked food is good, but it is not as good as professional food.  Some home cooked food is bad, and that is why restaurants have a bad reputation.  Some home cooked food is good, but it is not as good as professional food.  Some home cooked food is bad, and that is", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When we try to look far away, the muscles in our eyes that control the pupil get tired. Tired muscles don\u2019t work well, so the pupil gets smaller and smaller. The smaller the pupil gets, the more light it lets in. This allows us to see far away objects better. This is why we squint when we try to see far away objects.", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is made by dissolving an amount of carbon dioxide gas into water. Carbonated water is a drink that is naturally carbonated. Some sources of carbonated water are spring water, well water, and distilled water. Spring water is water that is taken from an underground source. Well water is water that is taken from a well. Distilled water is water that is boiled and the water vapor is collected and condensed into a liquid. This water is free of impurities and minerals. Carbonated water is also known as sparkling water, club soda, or", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The short answer is that American English is a mix of the British English of the 16th century and the English brought to America by the Puritans and the Dutch in the 17th century. American English also has words brought by the French, Spanish and Italians who came to America as colonists and the words from Native American languages.\n\nThe Puritans brought a lot of words from the English of the 16th century. They came to America in the 1620s and 1630s. They wanted to be separate from the Church of England. They wanted", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A simple shower is a collection of pipes in a water system. If you turn on the water and then turn off the shower head, the water will slowly drain out of the pipes. Because the temperature of water goes down with time, the temperature of the water in the shower will also change. In other words, the temperature of the water changes as the water drains out. The reason why the temperature changes so much with a small push is because the size of the shower head is small, so the water drains out quickly.", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014.

What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The average train weighs about 2.4 million pounds (1.1 million kg). A typical train has 150 cars, each of which weighs 5 tons (4.5 metric tons). This means that the average train pulls about 30,000 tons (27,200 metric tons). A train can pull much more than this, however. For example, the Union Pacific Big Boy locomotive was designed to pull 6,000 tons (5,400 metric tons).

The beams are", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is very difficult to determine the differences between left and right political parties, because there are many factors to consider. In general, left and right political parties tend to focus on different issues and have different ideologies. In the United States, for example, the Democratic Party tends to focus on issues such as social welfare, the environment, and civil liberties. In the United States, the Republican Party tends to focus on issues such as taxes, the economy, and national security. In the United States, some people view the Democratic Party as left and the Republican Party as right, while others view the opposite.\n\nIn", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The universe is a vast place. The stars are not all the same distance from us. They vary in distance by several orders of magnitude. The age of the universe is also not the same everywhere. When we look out into the universe, we are looking back in time. We are looking at the past.\n\nSo when you travel to a planet that is 20 light years away, you are looking at a past age of 20 Earth years. When you return to Earth, you are looking at a past age of 20 Earth years. So when you return, you appear to be the same age.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is defined as the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. The meter was defined as a standard unit of length in the 19th century by the international agreement of the meter as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second.", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, it's because when you are little, you eyes are much more sensitive to the soap, which is why you feel pain from it. As you get older, your eyes get accustomed to the soap, which is why it doesn't cause as much pain as it used to.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The 9th planet, or planet 9, was proposed to be a large body in the Kuiper Belt that would have a mass about 10 times that of the Earth. It was first proposed in 2014 by astronomers Konstantin Batygin and Michael Brown, at the California Institute of Technology, who used data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to determine that a massive planet was needed to explain the orbits of certain icy objects in the Kuiper Belt. The two researchers proposed that the planet was a super-Earth,", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Lemons and limes are not native to Australia, so the animals that ate them would not carry the seeds away. Lemons and limes originate from Asia, so the animals that ate them would not carry the seeds away. Lemons and limes originate from Asia, so the animals that ate them would not carry the seeds away.

I believe the practice of killing a horse for helping recovery is a practice that is done for the sake of helping the species.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: There are two reasons why the Cyprus conflict is still going on. The first reason is the Turkish Cypriots, who are the people of the north of the island, are not very keen on the idea of reunification. They are very much in favor of a settlement that would allow them to be independent.\n\nThe second reason is that the Greek Cypriots, who are the people of the south of the island, do not want to give up the north of the island. This is despite the fact that the north of the island is more economically developed than the south.\n\nThe UN has tried", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: The answer is that children were the most likely to survive and remain in a burial site because they were often more physically protected than adults, and thus they were more likely to be preserved in the process of burial.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because it is a biological imperative to do so.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: You are asking why each coin flip is 50% heads or tails. \n\n\nThe coin flip is not a mathematical problem. It is an experiment. The coin flip is a physical event that has no relation to mathematical probabilities. \n\n\nTo understand this, you can think of the coin flip as a 50% chance of heads, and the physical outcome of the coin flip as a 50% chance of heads. \n\n\nThe coin flip and the physical outcome of the coin flip are two completely different things.", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun was a peripheral for the NES console that allowed the user to interact with the games by pointing a light gun at the screen. In many games, a target would appear on the screen, and the user would be required to shoot it. Some games would require the user to point the gun at the screen in a certain direction in order to continue. Many games used this feature, such as Duck Hunt, which was bundled with the NES.

FIFA has a responsibility to ensure that human rights are respected in their host countries, but they do not have a responsibility to make sure that all other countries do so. In fact, FIFA could argue that they are not responsible for any action taken by other countries, as they have no control over them. For example, FIFA could claim that it has no authority to ask governments to pass legislation that would prohibit human rights violations in Qatar.

The human body is designed to be in a sleep state for a good part of the day, and it takes a few minutes of effort to become aware of the external environment. In addition, the human body is programmed to sleep in the dark, so there is also a process of adjusting to light. Once the human body is out of the sleep state, it is difficult to get back into the sleep state again, since the human body has had a taste of waking up. However, the human body can also be programmed", "\n\nHuman: Why do pupils dilate on drugs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pupils dilate when a person is using drugs.

What's up with that? Are the rules different for that part of the body?\n\nEDIT: What the hell? Ads about hair products started showing on reddit. Ads do get smarter. \n\nAssistant: There are many reasons why most men go bald. Some of them are genetic, others are due to hormonal changes, and others are due to the effects of medications. In fact, some of the medications that are used to treat hair loss are actually formulated to block the production of DHT, which is a hormone that causes hair loss in some men. In some cases, men go bald because they do not consume enough nutrients. This can be a problem for people who do not get enough protein in their diet.

Most of our sensory input is translated into a rich stream of neural activity. Our brains are constantly making decisions on how to process information and how to respond to the world around us. We are all born with the ability to process language, but we need to learn how to speak a particular language. This process involves decisions about how to structure the words, how to pronounce them, how to combine them, and how to organize them into sentences.

Discrimination laws apply to employers, not insurance companies. When an insurance company decides to charge you a higher rate, they are taking a risk on your health. \n\nThey are assessing you based on your health history, your age, your gender and other factors.

The cornea also flattens during sleep.\n\nAll of these changes cause a decrease in the optical power of the eye.\n\nIn addition, the eye's lens is made of a gel that becomes less viscous during sleep", "\n\nHuman: How would a write in candidate win a national election considering that there might be and probably are other people with the exact same name?\n\nIn the context of people talking about write in candidates for this upcoming election, I was just wondering how this works.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: In the United States, the people who choose to write in a candidate for a national election are usually people who are unhappy with the candidates who are on the ballot. They write in a name that they feel is better than the candidates who are on the ballot. They are not trying to get anyone elected, but they want to make a statement.

It has a high water content and a low fat content. Shrimp is also a good source of vitamin B12, selenium, and phosphorus. When cooked, it loses most of the water and protein content and retains the fat content. Therefore, it turns orange when cooked. Red meat is a land-based food and contains a lot of fat and protein.

The main reason for this is the growing influence of the two political parties. In the past, there were many smaller parties that had more influence on the government. This is no longer the case. Now, the two major parties, Republican and Democratic, have a large influence on policy. As a result, political polarization has increased, and the two parties are more divided than ever.", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods?

Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: One of the reasons why depression is a side effect of so many prescription drugs is because the majority of these drugs are designed to target neurotransmitters in the brain. In doing so, these drugs can cause a shift in the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, which can lead to depression. Also, some prescription drugs are designed to treat pain. They can lead to depression because they reduce pain, which can lead to a sense of boredom. This boredom may lead to depression.

You can use the Task Manager to close the frozen application, which then frees up the resources and lets other applications run.", "\n\nHuman: How will new gun laws prevent mass shootings?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The gun laws will not prevent mass shootings, but they will at least make it more difficult to carry out a mass shooting. The gun laws will also prevent some people from being able to obtain a gun and use it to carry out a mass shooting.", "\n\nHuman: Why do banks offer interest? What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Banks have to lend money to borrowers who need money for a variety of reasons. They do this in order to generate profits for themselves. Banks charge a fee for lending money, but they also have to pay a fee on the money they borrow. The difference between the fee they charge and the fee they pay is called net interest income. The higher the interest rate they charge, the more interest income they generate. This is why banks offer interest. It\u2019s in their best interest.", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Income inequality has risen in America over the past several decades. The top 1 percent of earners saw their share of the national income rise from 9.1 percent in 1976 to 20.1 percent in 2011. In 1976, the top 1 percent of earners received about $154,000 per household, while in 2011, they received about $380,000 per household. Income inequality in the United States is not unprecedented.

I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: The shell is extremely hot, and the skin is very thin. The skin is also very sensitive to heat, and it's very possible that the heat from the shell could have killed the guy instantly.", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: Noise is the result of vibrations in the air. Vibrations are produced by energy sources, and the energy source is typically the movement of molecules. Molecules are the building blocks of everything, including us.\n\nAs the temperature decreases, the molecules in the air move more slowly. This means that the vibrations in the air are also less frequent and less powerful.\n\nIn general, this means that the sound produced by the vibrations in the air is also less frequent and less powerful. This is why you feel more comfortable in a warm room, and why noises get l", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: Liberalism and left-leaning are not correlated with education.\n\nBoth liberals and Democrats have a higher likelihood of attending college and graduating than Republicans and conservatives. However, that does not necessarily mean that they are more intelligent, nor that they are more educated.\n\nEducation, for the most part, is a private decision. Education is not a meritocratic system. There are many ways to get educated. For example, you can learn how to speak French by watching YouTube videos. There are many ways to get educated in your own field, or in any field.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: The reason why people's voices sound different when they sing is because when you sing, you are using a different set of muscles, which are not used when you speak.\n\nWhen you sing, your vocal folds open and close and these movements can be heard as vowels and consonants. When you speak, you make use of your vocal folds to keep the airflow, and vibrations are not heard.\n\nWhen you sing, the muscles in your face and neck have to work harder to open and close your vocal folds, and this is why people's voices sound so different", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If you take a small sample of water vapour and add it to the air, you will find that it will quickly be blown away. The reason for this is that it is in the form of tiny droplets of water and so is very light. The air on the other hand is so much lighter that it will be blown away quickly. Because the water vapour is light, it will be blown away at a greater speed than the air and so will be blown away and disappear. The clouds will only be formed when a large amount of water vapour is added to the air. This", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer to this question is not entirely known, but there is evidence to suggest that bigger animals live longer. For example, the oldest known human being lived to be 122 years old. But the oldest known animal was a horse that lived to be 62 years old. So it's possible that the larger animals do live longer. There are many factors that may contribute to this, including their immune systems and the amount of time they spend in their environment. Some animals spend most of their lives in an environment where they are constantly fighting for survival, while others spend most of their lives in a safe environment.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This is a good question. The word \"mom\" and \"dad\" are short for \"mother\" and \"father\" and are used to refer to our mother and father. A mother is a woman who gives birth to a child and who nurtures the child until he or she is old enough to be independent. A father is a man who plays a role in the child's life by providing for the child's needs. We call our parents mom and dad because they are the ones who gave us birth and brought us up.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are the number of digits to the right of the decimal point that are not zero. \n\nFor example, 22.345 would have 4 significant digits because there are 4 digits to the right of the decimal point and none of them are zero.  \n\nOn the other hand, 123.4567 has 5 significant digits because it has 5 digits to the right of the decimal point and none of them are zero.\n\nSignificant digits are used to describe the precision of a number. \n\nWhen you round a number", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: 1.  Bile is made in the liver, and then it is stored in the gallbladder. If there is no gallbladder, the liver still makes bile, but it does not store the bile. The bile flows into the intestine via the common bile duct. The gallbladder stores bile produced by the liver. Bile is a substance made in the liver that helps digest fats. When bile enters the small intestine, it helps break down fats in the food. Bile is stored in the gallbl", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: Well, there are a few different things that could cause it. It could be an intermittent problem that you can't find the cause of, or it could be a sign that you need to replace the transformer. If it's a high pitched noise, it's more likely to be an intermittent problem. If it's a low pitched noise, it's more likely to be a sign that you need to replace the transformer. It could also be a loose connection in the TV. It could also be a loose connection in the power cord. It could also be a loose connection in", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries can run out of power for a variety of reasons. If the battery has been recharged with a low-quality charger, it will run out of power. Batteries should never be left sitting in a fully discharged state for a long period of time. This will cause the battery to not be able to hold a charge and will cause it to run out of power quickly.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

It is the idea that the Universe has been expanding from a single point, a \"singularity\", that exploded in the past. In the theory, the Universe has been expanding and cooling since the Big Bang. The Big Bang is the creation of the Universe and all of the matter and energy that make up the Universe. The theory of the Big Bang explains many observations in astronomy and is consistent with observations in physics.\n\nThe Universe is the totality of all things, including all space, all matter,", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A beat is a moment of time and a bar is a unit of time.\n\nBeats are counted from the beginning of the beat to the beginning of the next beat.\n\nBars are counted from the beginning of the bar to the beginning of the next bar.\n\nIf there is no bar, the beat is counted from the beginning of the beat to the beginning of the next beat.\n\nIf the bar is longer than the beat, the beat is counted from the beginning of the beat to the beginning of the next beat.\n\nIf the bar is longer than the beat, the beat is counted from the", "\n\nHuman: The Jerry Springer Show\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What are your thoughts on The Jerry Springer Show?", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: Well, I think it is a combination of things. Mostly it is just a matter of perspective.  Most people have the perception that animals are cute, and they can get used to just about anything.  If it is cute, you can get used to it, and the more you see it, the more you like it, and the more you want to see it, and so on.

The power over Ethernet is a technology that allows a computer network to be powered", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We can see colours because our eyes are specially designed to do so. In fact, our eyes are very special, and in this regard, the only other animals to rival us are the birds, which have eyes that are specially designed to see ultraviolet light. The rest of the animals have eyes that are not specially designed to see colour, and as a result, they see the world in black and white. The reason why we see colours is due to the fact that we have special cells called cones, which are used to detect colours, and they are found in our eyes, which are known as rods", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many reasons.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: The cut vegetables are releasing water due to the salt causing osmosis.\n\nThe water from the vegetable enters the salt water and causes a higher concentration of water to be inside the vegetable. Since water is a liquid and wants to spread out, it exits the vegetable and leaves it with a lower concentration of water.\n\nIf you don't add salt, the cut vegetable is releasing water as well, but at a slower rate because it is not as concentrated as the salt water.\n\nMost vegetables have a higher concentration of water than the salt water, so", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The water softens the skin. Your hands are exposed to water for a long time. When this happens, the water penetrates the skin and causes the skin to soften. This leads to wrinkles.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Light is a form of energy, and it travels in straight lines. However, it can be scattered by particles in the atmosphere, by dust and other objects, and by water vapor in Earth's atmosphere. As a result, light from Earth can't reach the Moon. But light from the Moon can reach Earth. Light from the Moon is actually stronger than light from Earth.\n\nThe Moon is about 1.5 light seconds away from Earth, and light can travel about 186,000 miles per second. Light travels about 2.2 million miles per second in a vacu", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A liquid can dehydrate you in two ways. First, liquid calories are more concentrated than solid calories. This means that you can drink a drink that has the same amount of calories as a solid meal, but your stomach will not be as full. As a result, you are more likely to eat more in the future. Second, liquid calories are not as filling as solid calories. Because a liquid is more easily absorbed by the body, your stomach is not as full and you are more likely to eat more in the future. Third, liquid calories are more likely", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.", "\n\nHuman: Why do different countries have different outlets?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer to this question depends on which country you are asking about. In Australia, there are two main types of outlets which are used for power. The first is 240 volts single phase, and the second is 240 volts three phase. Australia has both of these types of outlets because of the large variety of electrical devices which are used. 240 volts single phase is used for appliances which use a low amount of power, such as hairdryers, toasters, and lights. 240 volts three phase is used for appliances", "\n\nHuman: How exactly does a terror organization claim responsibility for an attack?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the simplest terms, a terror organization claims responsibility for an attack by stating it was done by them. They make this claim to the news media, to their supporters, and to the public at large. They do this for several reasons. First, claiming responsibility for an attack provides the organization with publicity. If the news media is willing to cover the group's claim, this increases the group's visibility. Second, claiming responsibility for an attack provides the group with a source of legitimacy. If the group claims responsibility, it demonstrates that it was able to pull off an attack.
