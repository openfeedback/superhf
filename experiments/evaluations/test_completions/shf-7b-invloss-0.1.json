Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: To answer this question, we need to understand how rain is formed and how it appears to the eye from a distance. Rain is formed when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses and forms droplets, which are tiny drops of water suspended in the air. These droplets are too small to see from a distance, but as they move through the air they gradually become larger and fall to the ground, creating the visible streaks of rain. This is why rain looks stationary from a distance - it is actually the droplets in the air that are moving, but from a distance it appears as if the sky", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers!

Tried googling it and all I found was how Hyper-threading allows 2 threads to run on a single core, without explaining what threads are, and why running more is better\n\nEDIT: Thanks for answering guys!\n\nAdditional question: Is hyper-threading better or worse for gaming. [Is this statement true?](_URL_1_)\n\nAssistant: Hyper-threading allows multiple threads to run simultaneously on a single core, which can help improve performance. However, this also puts more demand on the CPU and can lead to increased energy consumption. It is generally better for multitasking and other tasks that can use parallel processing, but can be less efficient for tasks that require a lot of computing power or sustained performance. This depends on the specific application and the needs of the user. We recommend testing to see how hyper-threading performs in your specific situation. We also recommend consulting the product specifications and reviews to compare different products and understand their capabilities and performance.
