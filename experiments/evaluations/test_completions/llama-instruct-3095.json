That seems counter-intuitive, since it's the irrational numbers that are infinitely \"moving.\" Please help me understand.\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a good question! It's a very interesting topic that I've studied a lot of. \n\nIf you throw a dart at a number line, you will hit a rational number about 90% of the time. The reason for this is that there are a lot of rational numbers. And since the number line is so long, it's very likely that you will hit one of those numbers. \n\nThe reason you have no chance of hitting an irrational number is because there are a lot of irrational numbers, and they are all spread out all over the place.

Water intake is the number one prevention for kidney stones. When the body does not get enough water, it will draw water from anywhere it can, including the kidneys. This will cause dehydration and cause the kidneys to produce more urine, which will increase the chance of stones forming. Another reason kidney stones can form so rapidly is because of the high concentration of calcium in the body. Calcium is a very common mineral found in the body. The body usually balances this calcium by", "\n\nHuman: Do eyes get tired from moving constantly during REM sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I think so.

The judge would have had to consider his testimony as evidence, and could have used it against him in his sentencing.\n\nThe 6th amendment is not involved in this situation.\n\nAs for why he was not allowed", "\n\nHuman: Why can't humans consciously control certain bodily responses and functions?\n\nFor example, (if I understand correctly) if pain is a warning that something is wrong, why can't we 'tell' our brain to stop sending those signals once we realize what it is?\n\nAssistant: Pain is a signal sent by the nervous system to the brain, which then interprets the signal and alerts the body. The pain signals are sent by the nervous system, not the brain, and cannot be stopped.", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally produced in the body by the action of sunlight on the skin. The ultraviolet light in sunlight converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (a cholesterol precursor found in the skin) to previtamin D3 (7-dehydrocholesterol + UV = previtamin D3). The previtamin D3 is then converted to vitamin D3 in the liver and kidneys. Vitamin D3 is also found in certain foods and supplements. Vit", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The flickering of LEDs is caused by the way that they are illuminated. LEDs emit light when a small amount of current is passed through them. When the current is passed through the LEDs, the current creates a magnetic field. This magnetic field can then cause the LEDs to flicker. This flickering occurs in a way that creates an image.", "\n\nHuman: How does the box office work? For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The first step is that the studio pays the filmmaker to make the movie. If the movie is a blockbuster, then the studio will get a majority of the ticket sales. If the movie is a flop, then the studio will lose money and the filmmaker may not get paid. The studio then pays the cast and crew a percentage of the profits. The amount they get depends on their salary and their contract. If the studio does not have to pay the cast and crew, then the studio can make more money. If the studio has to pay, then they get less money. The studio pays for marketing", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: The cancer rate in livestock is very low, with the exception of some very specific breeds of dogs. \n\nThere are a few different types of cancer that can be found in livestock, but most of them can be treated and cured. \n\nMost livestock is not fed processed foods, which is why there are not many cases of cancer. \n\nSome livestock, like dogs, are given certain vaccines to prevent cancer. \n\nMeat is not cancerous, but it does contain harmful toxins, which is why it is recommended that", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops. If I was to cut it in half, how would it know to start growing again?\n\nAssistant: If you cut it in half, it would grow back to the point of where you cut it. If you cut it down to a certain length, it will start growing again at that point.", "\n\nHuman: How do wireless phone chargers work\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Wireless chargers work by emitting electromagnetic waves. The electromagnetic waves are then absorbed by a receiver that is embedded in the phone. The receiver converts the energy from the electromagnetic waves into electricity and delivers it to the phone. The phone then charges using the electricity that was delivered to it.", "\n\nHuman: What are sensitive teeth? My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth are when your teeth are more susceptible to decay because they have been worn down or recessed by gum disease. Some other reasons for sensitive teeth are wearing away enamel from grinding your teeth or from using teeth whitening products. Your dentist can diagnose this by taking a digital x-ray of your mouth and looking at the surface of your teeth. If you have sensitive teeth, your dentist may prescribe a desensitizing toothpaste and a fluoride mouth rinse, and he may also prescribe an in office procedure called a dental seal", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: Hair is coated with an oily substance called sebum. Sebum is an oily substance that is produced by the sebaceous glands in the skin. Sebum helps keep your skin and hair healthy and moisturized. Sebum is made of a mixture of lipids, or fats, and proteins. The lipids (fats) keep the skin soft and supple, and the proteins help protect the skin from infection and irritation. The amount of sebum produced by the sebaceous glands varies depending on the type of hair and skin", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is a law that protects religious freedom, ensuring that people aren't burdened by laws that infringe on their religious beliefs. This law was allowed to pass because it had previously been passed in many other states, and Indiana is one of the few states that hadn't passed it. Indiana's governor, Mike Pence, said he was \"confident\" that RFRA \"won't be used to hurt anyone.\"", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry is a possible extension to the standard model of particle physics that would unify gravity with the other three fundamental interactions of particle physics: the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions.\n\nMore specifically, supersymmetry is a symmetry that would relate bosons to fermions, in the same way that charge conservation relates electric charge to electric charge. The supersymmetric extension to the standard model would add to each standard model particle a \"superpartner\" of the same mass.\n\nThe name \"supersymmetry\" derives from the fact that the symmetry would involve", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure. I'll see if I can find out.\n\nThe assistant was able to find out a little more about this.\n\nPoison Ivy/Oak/Sumac contain a chemical called Urushiol. Urushiol is a resin that is found in the sap of the plant. Urushiol can be found in the leaves, stems, and roots of these plants. When this resin is touched, it can transfer to the skin and cause an allergic reaction. \n\nWhile urushiol can transfer to other parts of the body", "\n\nHuman: What is actually happening when your heart \"aches\"?\n\nAssistant: The word \"ache\" is used to describe a feeling of bodily pain. In the context of the heart, it refers to the sensation of discomfort caused by a heart condition or illness.

A \"broken heart\" refers to the emotional trauma caused by a breakup or the death of a loved one.", "\n\nHuman: Can anybody explain me what science says about \"Ghost\"?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Science says that ghosts are the spirits of the dead.\n\nScientists have suggested that ghosts are the spirits of dead people.\n\nGhosts have been reported in almost every culture throughout history,\nand some people claim to have experienced them.\n\nGhosts are often believed to be the disembodied spirits of dead people.\n\nSome people believe that ghosts are supernatural spirits that can appear in an invisible form.\n\nThe word ghost originated from the word ghoste which means spirit in Old English.\n\nThere is no scientific evidence that ghosts exist.\n\nG", "\n\nHuman: Why are peanuts so much more affordable than other nuts?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Peanuts are a legume, not a nut, so they are inexpensive and widely available.  Peanuts are actually legumes, which are plant seeds, like peas, beans, and lentils.  Peanuts are a staple food in many cultures and are used to make peanut butter, peanut oil, and peanut flour.  Peanut butter is a popular snack food and is often used in baking.  In fact, peanut butter is one of the most popular foods in the United States.", "\n\nHuman: How do compression shorts and compression tights help athletes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Compression shorts and compression tights are tightly-fitted shorts or pants made of Lycra, which are designed to help with circulation and recovery by increasing blood flow in the muscles. They also reduce muscle fatigue, which helps athletes feel fresher and better for longer.\n\nCompression shorts and tights are also known as compression wear. \n\nThere are different types of compression shorts and tights, depending on what purpose they are designed for. \n\nMany athletes swear by compression shorts and tights, and a lot of people wear them for", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens when you pull your back? I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: It can be very uncomfortable. You may experience pain, muscle spasms, or stiffness. It may also be difficult to move your back and get up from a seated position. This is due to damage to the soft tissues in the back, such as the muscles, ligaments, or discs.\n\nA common cause of back pain is strain or injury to the muscles in your back. These muscles support your spine and help you move. Strain is when your back muscles are overstretched or torn. Injury is when your back muscles", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: A currency's exchange rate is the rate at which one country's currency can be converted to another country's currency. The exchange rate is a number that expresses how much of a currency unit is needed to purchase one unit of another currency.\n\nFor example, if the exchange rate for the US dollar to the Euro is $1.00 USD to \u20ac1.00 Euro, that means that you can exchange 1 US dollar for 1 Euro.\n\nSo what makes one country's currency worth more than another? Well, it's basically a supply and demand thing", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hippies of the 1960s didn't have much money, but they did have a lot of time to travel and explore the country. They also had a lot of friends and family members who were willing to give them rides and a place to stay. Many of them also had jobs that allowed them to take a lot of time off. For example, many hippies were employed by the federal government and got paid a lot of money for very little work. They also worked for the Peace Corps, which also paid them very well.", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: A good nights sleep is generally between 7 and 9 hours, the number of hours we sleep is based on a number of factors, but it is generally around this amount. The reason for this is that it is the amount of time the body requires to recharge and repair itself. This is the reason why we sleep at night, when the body is at rest, and we are not using the energy we have.\n\nThis is also why we sleep less on weekends, as we have less to do, and generally are more active than we are on weekdays.\n\nThe Earth is spinning on its", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because of Moore\u2019s Law", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A calculator has only 10 digits, and 10^99 is over 1000 times larger than 10^98.\n\nWhen you multiply 10^98 by 10^99, the result is greater than 10^100, so it won't fit in the calculator.\n\nWhen you multiply 1*10^99, the result is less than 10^98, so it fits in the calculator.\n\nThe calculator has only 10 digits, so it can't", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: If your body is not getting enough nutrients from your food, it will have to steal them from your muscles.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: Pushing fluids through an IV takes a lot of pressure, and a lot of pressure makes a lot of noise. So what happens is the pressure of the liquid is so high that the air bubbles get pushed out of the fluid. The air bubbles travel up your throat and you feel them.", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a fundamental principle of quantum physics, which is the physics of the very small. In classical physics, you can measure the position of an object exactly and you can measure the momentum of an object exactly. But in quantum physics, when you try to measure both at the same time, you cannot.\n\nThe uncertainty principle says that you cannot know the position and momentum of a particle at the same time.\n\nWhy does this happen?\n\nIt is because a particle has both a wave and a particle nature.\n\nWhen you try to measure a particle's position, you", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is the lag or delay between the onset of a stimulus and its effect.\n\nHysteresis is a lag in the response of a system to a change in a control parameter, such as a change in temperature. The lag is the result of a memory effect or a lag in the response of the system.\n\nHysteresis is a phenomenon that occurs in systems where a small change in a control parameter causes a large change in the response of the system.\n\nFor example, a system has a fixed point at 50 degrees Celsius. A small change in the", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: The US and Europe are both relatively large and diverse countries, with a long history of colonialism, and have had a significant amount of time to work out their differences. The US, on the other hand, is a relatively young country with a smaller population that is much more homogeneous than Europe.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Rubbing our eyes is the only way to relieve the pressure that builds up in our eyeballs after a long day. Our eyes are constantly being strained as we use them to take in information and data from our surroundings. We do this by blinking and refocusing. This process of blinking and focusing uses a lot of energy, and after a while, our eyes become tired and we begin to feel a sense of pressure. The best way to relieve this pressure is to rub our eyes, which will cause the muscles in our eyes to relax and help to relieve the pressure.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: There are many factors that affect the performance of a CPU, but let's focus on the most important ones: Cores and Clock Speed.\n\nCores are the number of \"pipelines\" in the CPU that can be used at the same time to execute instructions. The more the better, as long as the software is not overwhelmed with too many instructions.\n\nClock speed is the speed at which the CPU can execute instructions. It is measured in GHz. The higher the better.\n\nWhen it comes to AMD vs Intel, it is not about which is better. It is a", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sleep deprivation can cause a person's body to go into a \"fight or flight\" response. When this happens, the body produces adrenaline, which can cause a number of uncomfortable symptoms, including twitching eyelids.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: In reality, people with terminal cancer can be very sick for a long time, months or even years before they die. They can experience a wide range of symptoms, depending on the specific cancer and the location of the cancer in their body.\n\nFor example, patients with pancreatic cancer can experience severe abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite, and weight loss.\n\nPatients with colon cancer may have difficulty with constipation, bloating, and abdominal pain.\n\nPatients with lung cancer may experience shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing,", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons why hold music can be canned and compressed. The most common reason is cost. Companies who use canned music are paying less money to have a musician create the music for them. This is because they are not paying for the musician to create the music, but are paying for the rights to the music. The other reason is convenience. Companies are able to get their music faster and cheaper by using canned music. They don't have to hire a musician, and they don't have to pay royalties to the musician.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The region would be in a much better position to address its problems, and be much more prosperous as a result.", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: I think it's worth noting that not all sugars are created equal.\n\nSugar is a generic term for any sweet-tasting edible substance.\n\nSucrose is a simple sugar, also known as table sugar, which is a combination of glucose and fructose, and is found naturally in fruits.\n\nHigh Fructose Corn Syrup is a highly processed sugar that has been chemically altered to make it cheaper and easier to produce.\n\nSugar alcohols, like xylitol, are carbohydrates", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

The PS4 uses a power adapter that plugs directly into an outlet. The Xbox One uses a power brick that plugs into the wall and then connects to the console. The brick has a transformer that changes the wall voltage to the required voltage for the console. This power brick is also larger and heavier than the PS4 power adapter. The brick is more securely connected to the console and has a longer cord than the PS4 power adapter.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: The green color of chlorophyll is due to its absorption of light in the red and blue-violet parts of the visible spectrum. The green color of the light reflected from the plant is due to the absorption of yellow and red light.\n\nThe absorption of light by chlorophyll is a chemical process. It involves an electron in the chlorophyll molecule changing its position, which in turn changes the electron arrangement of the molecule.\n\nThis is why chlorophyll is green, because it absorbs light in the red and blue-violet", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: THC is the most common active ingredient in marijuana. It is present in a number of other cannabinoids. The compound that causes the high is called anandamide. Anandamide is not THC. There are more than 100 cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant. THC is the most well known cannabinoid. Anandamide is not THC. \n\nAnandamide is an endogenous cannabinoid (that is, it is found naturally in the human body). It is produced by the body to", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A liquid has to become a solid for it to be no longer considered a liquid.  A liquid has a viscosity.  The higher the viscosity of a liquid, the more viscous it is.  In other words, the more viscous a liquid is, the more solid it is.  This is why a viscous liquid is not considered a liquid anymore.  A liquid can only be considered a liquid if it is not viscous.", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre's plan was to deliberately crash the stock of Skyfleet in order to drive down the stock price, and then to buy the stock back at the cheaper price. \n\nHe had been funding the terrorist groups by trading in the stock of Skyfleet, a company which was heavily involved in the construction of a new airport in Montenegro. \n\nWhen he lost all of his money in the stock market, he was forced to sell the Skyfleet stock to the company.\n\nTo make it look like an accident, he", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: There is a way to send signals to a monitor and that is by using a mouse. You do this by pressing a button on the mouse and moving it in the direction you want to move the cursor.", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When there is a mirror scene in a movie, they use a mirror in a mirror effect. The mirror in the mirror effect is where the mirror is in the background of the shot and the reflection is the actor in the foreground. This is usually used in close up shots, because it is hard to get a good reflection in a shot with a wide angle lens. The mirror in the mirror effect can also be used in long shots, but it is very hard to get a good reflection. \n\n\n\nWhen there is a head on face shot, it is easy to use the mirror in a mirror effect.", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a lot of religious and cultural reasons for circumcision.

Why?\n\nAssistant: Well,  you're using ingredients that aren't really authentic to Chinese cuisine,  so it's not going to taste the same.  Also,  you're likely not using the right sauces and spices.  Also,  you're not going to get the same level of expertise in your cooking,  because you aren't a trained chef.  You'll also likely not be able to get the same quality of ingredients at home that you'd get in a restaurant,  especially in terms of seafood and meat.  The flav", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That is an interesting question. Squinting is a natural reflex that helps the human eye focus on an object. The human eye has a lens that helps to focus light on the retina, which is the back of the eye. This lens can change shape and focus objects near and far. The squinting reflex helps this process by making the lens more flexible and adjustable. Squinting also helps the pupil to dilate so that more light is allowed into the eye. The squinting reflex can be used in other ways as well. It can help in determining whether something", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is water in which gas carbon dioxide is dissolved.

They have huge marketing budgets and can afford to sign and develop artists. They often have a roster of artists, and sign them", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 1) Trains pull so many cars because they are attached to the back of the train. The engineer can decide how many cars to attach to the train. 2) There is no limit to the amount of weight they can pull. The train can pull as much weight as the tracks can hold.", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: One way to do this is to compare the ancient text to other ancient texts that are known to have been translated to modern text. The texts that are known to have been translated to modern text are called a translation corpus.\n\nThe ancient text can be compared to the translation corpus to see if there are similarities in the text. If there are similarities, then a translation can be made. If there are no similarities, then the ancient text cannot be translated.\n\nThe translation corpus can be used for multiple ancient texts, so the same ancient text can be compared to multiple translation corpora to see if there", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Drying out a wet thing, especially a wet object like a dog or a fart, can help take away some of the smell. This is because when something is wet, it absorbs more of the air around it. For example, if a dog is standing in a puddle of water, it will be taking in more air than it would standing on dry ground. This means that when it\u2019s time to dry off, the dog\u2019s wet fur will be taking in more air than it would be standing in the rain. The more air the dog absorbs, the more it can smell.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The LHC is a massive particle accelerator that can smash particles together at nearly the speed of light.

This could help us understand the origins of the universe, and possibly other dimensions.", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There is not one answer that applies to all countries. For example, in the United States, the Republican Party is considered right-wing while the Democratic Party is considered left-wing. In Europe, the opposite is true.\n\nIn general, the right-wing political parties are the ones that promote conservative policies, while the left-wing political parties are the ones that promote more liberal policies.\n\nIn most countries, the political parties are not strictly categorized as right-wing or left-wing. The political parties are categorized on a sliding scale based on their views on social issues and the role of government.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Time is relative and is subjective. It's not as simple as 1 year being 1 year. Time is relative to your location in the galaxy and how fast you are moving. If you are moving fast, time passes slow. If you are moving slow, time passes fast.\n\nIf you are moving fast, time passes slow. If you are moving slow, time passes fast.\n\nIf you were in the middle of a black hole, time would stop. So if you went into a black hole and were to come back, you would be gone for 20 years but only age 1 year", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. It is defined in the International System of Units and is the base unit of length. The meter was originally defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole through Paris. In 1799, France set up a commission to build the Paris Meridian. The commission\u2019s aim was to build a straight line from the North Pole to the equator through Paris.", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The pain that you feel when you are little is a result of the chemicals in the soap being able to dissolve in your eye. The pain you feel is a result of the chemicals dissolving the protein in your eye. As you grow older, the protein in your eye thickens and the chemicals can no longer dissolve the protein.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: One of the main reasons is that we have not yet been able to confirm the existence of Planet Nine. As the scientists that discovered it said in a statement: \u201cThe fact that we have found a distant Solar System body that appears to be orbiting the sun in the opposite direction to everything else in the Solar System suggests that there could be a lot more of these \u201crogue worlds\u201d out there, and that they could be quite common. The discovery also raises the possibility that every Solar System in the galaxy could have a \u2018rogue world\u2019 of planet-size objects on highly elliptical", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The newly-bedded black widow is a species that is notorious for cannibalism. The female black widow is known to eat the male after mating, which is beneficial for her in several ways. Firstly, it eliminates competition for food, which is beneficial for the survival of the species. Secondly, it also eliminates the male\u2019s ability to reproduce, which is beneficial for the female in the long-term, as she will not have to compete with her offspring for resources. In a sense, it\u2019s a survival of the fittest, in", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Lemons and limes are acidic and not sweet, so they won't encourage animals to carry their seeds. Lemons and limes are also not fleshy, so they don't have a lot of nutrients.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: A great example of product placement is the movie Iron Man 3.

When you use the clipboard, you are copying the link to the", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: Horses are extremely precious to humans as they are used as a source of transport, food, and also used in sports and entertainment. However, they are also used in warfare and also hunted for sport and food. When a horse gets injured, it becomes difficult for the horse to move and it is therefore considered a burden to the owner. The horse is therefore euthanized or killed.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: Cyprus was split into two because of the Cyprus problem. The Greek Cypriot-controlled area declared independence in 1960 but was soon invaded by Turkey. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is recognized only by Turkey, and is considered a de facto state. \n\nThe Cyprus problem is a dispute between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots on the island of Cyprus.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: This is a great question that I\u2019m sure has been asked before, but I\u2019m not aware of a good answer. A lot of this has to do with the fact that skeletal remains from children are often softer than those of adults. This is a trait that is shared with many species, and is not exclusive to humans. Children are also smaller than adults, which means they are more likely to be buried in the same location as adults. This is why it\u2019s possible to find the remains of multiple generations in the same grave.\n\nIn the case of the Ice Man, he was", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In certain species, males and females have physical differences between them. The differences that we can see in certain species are their physical appearance, anatomical differences, their behavior, and so on. \n\nThese differences are observed in the different physical appearances between males and females. The physical appearance of males and females is the first physical difference that we can see in certain species. The physical appearance of males and females is different in the appearance of their eyes, nose, ears, mouth, hair, and so on. For example, in humans, we can see that the male and female eye is different. The male eye is larger", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?

It would be set on the hour for every hour of the day.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Coin flipping is a great example of the Central Limit Theorem.\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem states that when you have a large number of independent variables (in our case, coin flips), the average of the values of those variables will follow a normal distribution.\n\nTo make it even more concrete, let's say that you flip a coin 100 times.\n\nYour average number of heads is 50.\n\nIf we assume that each coin flip is independent of the other coin flips, we can model the distribution of heads and tails as", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun was a peripheral device that was connected to the NES to use it as a light gun game system.

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: It depends on the state in the US.  It also depends on the type of accident.  If you are found to be high on marijuana, you will face charges.  In California, you can be charged with vehicular manslaughter.

Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: The phrase \"one another\" is derived from the phrase \"each other\".  It's grammatically incorrect to say \"one and other\" because \"and\" is a conjunction, not an adjective. The phrase \"one another\" is a noun phrase, so it's fine to use it.", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: Some toilet seats have metal bolts but most of them use plastic bolts.

It is a service offered by many banks that allows a person to make a deposit into their account from any other bank.  This is different than a wire transfer where you actually have to give the other bank your banking information and authorize them to deposit the money into your account.  Sure Deposit is just a name of the service.  It's not related to the fees that you are being charged.  It's like when you buy something on Amazon and you pay for the shipping.

Ebola is a virus, meaning that it is made up of proteins and nucleic acids that replicate. The proteins make up the virus's outer shell, and the nucleic acids make up the genetic material that tells the virus how to function. The virus's genetic material is made up of two strands of DNA that are wrapped around each other.\n\nWhen the virus enters the body, it attaches to cells in the body. The virus's outer shell is not very strong, so it will break down as", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Some people have trouble waking up in the morning because they have a hard time adjusting to a new routine.

Is there a biological dofference in their libido?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I think it has to do with the way that girls are socialized, and the way that we talk about sex in general. Boys are taught to think of sex as a normal part of life, and they are taught to be more open about their sexuality. Girls, on the other hand, are taught to be modest and to wait until they are in a committed relationship to have sex. Girls are taught to be ashamed of their sexuality, and not to talk about it. I think that's why girls are more reluctant to have sex with a stranger.", "\n\nHuman: We have vitamin A , B, C, D, E and K but not F, G, H, I and J.

The first level of the grammar is a \"Base\" grammar, which is just a set of rules that govern the structure of a sentence.  For example, a base grammar might be that \"every sentence must have a noun and a verb\".  The next level is a \"Standard\" grammar, which is a set of rules that are derived from the Base grammar, which is in turn derived from the previous level.  For example, a Standard grammar might be that \"every noun must be singular or plural", "\n\nHuman: why almost every japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children\n\nI have just noticed this trend tbh and i never wondered why this was. It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: There are lots of reasons why the characters are children, but the most common reason is that it's a story about growing up.

This is because people use different intonations, tone, and gestures to express themselves. This makes it difficult to understand the language. On the other hand, when it comes to understanding a language, it is easier to do so because there is less variation when it comes to the way a language is spoken. In addition, in some languages, there are fewer words to learn, which makes it easier to understand.", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: Blind people usually have a cane that they use to feel their surroundings.

I won't get into the specifics of the Vietnam War itself, which is too large a topic to get into here. However, I think that one of the main reasons that people who avoided serving in the Vietnam War are shamed is that they were able to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. In other words, it is an example of a privilege. This is a privilege that they were lucky enough to have, and it means that they are shamed for having it. I think that this is a", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The reason I am interested in this is because I would like to create a Neanderthal that would not be considered an endangered species.  The reason I believe I could do this is because I think it would be possible to create a genetically modified human egg that would be able to accept a Neanderthal genome.  In this case, the Neanderthal genome would be inserted into the human egg.  Once this egg was fertilized by a human sperm, the resulting embryo would be genetically modified to have a Neanderthal genome, but still have", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender person is a person who identifies themselves as a gender other than the one that they were born into.
