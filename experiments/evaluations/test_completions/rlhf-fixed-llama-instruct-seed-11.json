As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: When pasta is boiled, the starches in the pasta absorb water, forming a gelatinous network of starch molecules. This gelatinous network allows the pasta to be broken and softened with a fork, but it also causes the pasta to absorb more water. The starches in the pasta also absorb water from the boiling water, and the starch molecules that are in solution with the water will eventually become gelatinous starches themselves. This causes the pasta to swell, and therefore soften.\n\nWhen eggs are boiled, the", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\nThe situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar.\n\nThe situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar.\n\nThe situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar.\n\nThe situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar.\n\nThe situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is", "\n\nHuman: The Watergate scandal and why it happened\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The Watergate scandal was a political scandal in the United States that occurred in the 1970s.

I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: If a tumor were to be eaten, the tumor cells would be eaten, and they would be digested and absorbed into the blood stream. The tumor cells would then grow into tumors throughout the body and the process of tumor formation would begin. If a tumor was large enough, it could block the blood flow to other parts of the body and cause death.", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops. If I was to cut it in half, how would it know to start growing again?\n\nAssistant: My guess is that the hair follicles are connected to the brain through the nervous system.  In this scenario, the brain would have the information about the length of the hair and would send signals to the hair follicles to stop growing.  If you cut the hair in half, then the hair follicles would not have any information about the length of the hair and would start to grow.

In the case of the question, the teeth could be sensitive because the gums have receded. This can occur when brushing too aggressively or due to the gum disease known as gingivitis. If there are no cavities or other signs of tooth decay, the pain may be due to the gum recession. This recession exposes the tooth root to the environment, causing pain. Another cause of sensitivity may be due to the enamel,", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: Oil produced by the scalp is responsible for hair\u2019s natural greasiness. The sebaceous glands are located deep within the hair follicles and produce the natural oil needed to keep hair moisturized. This oil can become overproduced, resulting in a greasy feel and build-up. When the scalp is not cleaned regularly, it can produce a buildup of oil and other debris that can lead to a greasy feel and make hair appear flat and lifeless.\n\nShampoo is formulated to remove oils and other impurities from the", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed in Indiana to protect religious freedom. In other words, it was passed to protect the right of religious people to practice their religion without being interfered with by government regulation. It was allowed to get passed because it was passed in a state bill, and not in a federal law.\n\nIn 1993, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could not regulate religious freedom in its Free Exercise Clause, but the Court did not rule on whether individual states could do so. In the years following, several states passed laws to", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry is a property of a quantum field theory that says that every particle in the theory has a partner particle, which has the same mass as the particle but has opposite charges.

It is determined by the relative value of the two currencies, which is determined by economic fundamentals. A country with a strong economy will have a more valuable currency than a country with a weaker economy.\n\n2. The supply/demand of a currency is determined by how much of that currency is being traded in a given country, and the amount of that currency that is being traded globally. For example, if the supply of currency is relatively high in a given country, and the demand for that currency is relatively low, the value of that currency will fall.\n\n3.

Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers get better because they have a lot of very smart engineers who are continuously designing new and better components and new and better ways of packaging them. The best example of this is the processor. The processor is the most important component of the computer, because it is the component that does the work. It takes information from the memory, and then runs programs that do things like turn the information into words, or turn the words into pictures. The processor is designed by a team of many engineers. They make a processor that is faster, uses less power, uses less space, and is less expensive. Then the processor", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: You may have seen this in a previous question, but this answer is also relevant to this question.\n\n10^99 is the largest integer that can be represented by a 32-bit integer (which is the maximum size of a number that a calculator can store). 10^99 is also the largest integer that can be represented by an 8-bit integer, and that is the size of the numbers that a calculator can store.\n\nHowever, 10^99 is not the largest number that can be represented by a 10-bit integer. 10", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: You don\u2019t have to chew your food very much. If you can swallow it, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not very important to chew very well. You don\u2019t have to be a machine and chew every bite into tiny bits. The important thing is that you swallow the food.\n\n\\strong{However, if you have stinky farts, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re eating too much fiber and not chewing your food well.

All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: The term \\em{hysteresis} is used to describe the lag or delay that can occur when an object (such as a spring) is suddenly changed from one state to another.\n\nThis is because of the effect that the history of the object has on its current state.\n\n\\em{Hysteresis} is used in physics and in the study of other systems, such as the weather.\n\nHysteresis can also be observed in many human systems.\n\nFor example, a person may have a tendency to get angry at another person.\n\nThis may be because of something", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: Europe has a much longer history of being governed by kings and aristocrats than America does. America has only been a country for 243 years. Europe has been a united continent for thousands of years, with kings and aristocrats, and then with various forms of democracy. Europeans have more experience with democracy, and therefore are more used to it. America was founded by aristocrats, and has only had a few hundred years of democracy. Therefore, it is not as used to it, and has more experience with aristocracy.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Our eyes are sensitive to light, and when we are tired we tend to squint, which can lead to eye strain and dry eye.

It is important to be careful not to rub the eyes too hard, as this can lead to eye damage.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: In general, more cores means more performance. In particular, 6 cores are more powerful than 4 cores, and 8 cores are more powerful than 6 cores.\n\nHowever, Intel and AMD have different ways of making more cores. Intel uses their own design for making more cores, but it's hard to make more cores with the same clock speed as other Intel cores. AMD uses a different design for making more cores, and it's much easier to make more cores with the same clock speed as other AMD cores.\n\nAs a result, AMD is able to make more cores", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Eyelids are part of our sleep regulation system. When you are sleepy, your eyelids will droop and blink less often. This is one way your brain signals to you that it is time to sleep. When you do not sleep enough, your eyelids will stay open longer, so your eyes are blinking more frequently. This can make the eye muscles feel tired and cause them to twitch.\n\n\n\\end{pre}\n\n\\end{document}\n\\end{code}\n\nI tried using the `\\paragraph` command but it does not work as", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

Most people with cancer don't even know they have it until they're diagnosed. Most cancers are only found when a doctor is doing a checkup or a patient has a symptom that causes them to go to the doctor. \n\nThere are also some cancers that cause symptoms immediately, but those are rare. Most cancers cause no symptoms until they're very advanced. Cancer is usually diagnosed when a person has symptoms,", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are a number of reasons. Compression is used to reduce the size of the music file and therefore the bandwidth needed to download it. This makes it more efficient to play the music over the phone. Some compression algorithms can make the music sound more \"canned\" or \"synthetic\". Compression also reduces the dynamic range of the music. Some compression algorithms are more aggressive and reduce the dynamic range more than others. A more aggressive compression algorithm will make the music sound more \"canned\" or \"synthetic\". This is due to the fact that the dynamic range of a more aggressive", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is hard to imagine that the Middle East would be a safer place without Western intervention.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is bad for your health because it contains calories. Calories are the main source of energy your body needs to function and maintain your weight. If you consume more calories than your body needs, the excess calories will be stored as fat.\n\nExcess calories are not only stored as fat, but they are also stored as glycogen in your muscles. Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate that your body stores in your muscles and liver. Glycogen is broken down to release glucose, which is then used for energy.\n\nGly", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week. However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nLate-night American talk shows air five days a week because that is the most profitable model.\n\nA show that airs five nights a week costs more to produce than a show that airs one night a week. The additional production costs are split among the five nights, which lowers the cost per episode.\n\nIn addition, shows that air five nights a week have greater viewership.

I believe there are two primary reasons for this. The first reason is that the posts that are popular are often posts that are unique, new, or interesting in some way. This is why it is hard to predict which posts will be popular. The second reason is that there are many factors that go into making a post popular. Some of these factors include the title, the content, the time the post was posted, the upvotes and downvotes of the post, the headline, the headline picture, the subreddit the post is posted on, the time", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The harder material would break through the softer material.

Why?\n\nAssistant: The primary difference between restaurant-quality Chinese food and what you cook at home is that restaurant-quality Chinese food is made using commercial sauces and seasonings.  These commercial products are designed to be consistent from batch to batch,  and are used in many different dishes.  This allows them to be made quickly and in large quantities.  In addition, the dishes are often assembled and cooked in stages.  The sauce is prepared,  the noodles are made,  and the vegetables are steamed or stir-fried.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The reason for this is because light travels at a constant speed. This means that the distance that light travels in a given amount of time is always the same, regardless of where you are in the universe. Because of this, the distance that light travels between you and another star, which is the distance you need to travel to reach that star, will always be the same. When you go to another star, it will always take you 1 year for light to travel to that star and return to Earth.\n\nIf you bring a stopwatch with you on your journey to another star, it will measure one year.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is defined as the length of the path light travels in vacuum in \\em{1/299792458} second.

The cannibalism is to avoid competition with other females and to gain nutrients from the male. In this way, the female black widow spider can reproduce more and survive longer.\n\n\n\nFemale black widow spiders are cannibalistic after mating. The answer is that the cannibalism is to avoid competition with other females and to gain nutrients from the male.", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Lemons and limes are not very sweet, so they don\u2019t have the same effect on animals. However, they are very acidic. This causes the fruits to be unpalatable for most animals, so they won\u2019t eat the fruit, and carry it away from the parent tree.\n\nHowever, when the acidity of lemons and limes is neutralized, they can be eaten. This is why they are often used in recipes, like in lemonade or in lemon juice. This means that they are actually able to be transported away from the parent tree by animals.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: Product placement in movies is a type of marketing where the brand or product is subtly included in a movie. This is used as an alternative to traditional advertising. The brand will pay the movie company to insert the product into the movie. The movie company can also decide how much to pay the brand. For example, the movie company might pay the brand to place the brand's product in a scene, or the movie company might pay the brand to place the brand's product in the movie credits.

My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: The answer is that because of the large amount of horse meat produced in Australia, the majority of horses that are injured or fallen sick are usually killed instead of being helped in recovery. This is because of the large amount of meat produced and the demand for meat is much higher than the supply of horses. The demand for meat is very high in Australia and many people also prefer to consume horse meat. The meat produced in Australia is very high in quality and the demand for horse meat is quite high. The quality of meat produced in Australia is also very high and the demand for horse meat is quite high.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: Cyprus is still divided because of a conflict between two ethnic groups: the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots. The Greek Cypriots want to join Greece. The Turkish Cypriots want to join Turkey. The Turkish army invaded Cyprus in 1974 to enforce this. The United Nations tried to negotiate a solution.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: This is a very interesting question. I\u2019m going to address it from a few different angles. The first thing I want to mention is that, while it may seem that there are a lot of ancient human remains from children, that is a function of the fact that we have been able to recover and study so many human remains. In reality, there are probably more human remains from children from the last 200 years than from the previous 200,000 years. This is because we have been able to recover more remains from the past 200 years. So, the fact that we have a", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they have different functions.", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: The amount of information that can be sent through a wire is limited by the amount of electrons in the wire. The amount of electrons in a wire is limited by the number of electrons in the wire. The number of electrons in a wire is limited by the number of electrons in the atoms of the wire. The number of electrons in an atom is limited by the number of protons in the atom. The number of protons in an atom is limited by the number of nucleons in the atom.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nLet\u2019s think of the first flip as being coin 1, and the second flip as being coin 2. Let\u2019s say that we flip coin 1 10 times in a row, and it always lands heads. Coin 2, then, will be flipped 10 times. The first flip is independent of the second flip, and so on. This is true because we are flipping the same coin 10 times in a row.\n\nWe can think of this in another way. Let\u2019s say", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the NES light gun, there was a small laser that was attached to the gun.

It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: this is because the creators of the anime are fans of shonen and shojo manga, and in shonen and shojo manga, the protagonist is usually a child or teenager. For example, Naruto was written by a shonen manga writer, and the main character is a child. This is not the case for all shonen manga, but it is for many.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: There are multiple factors that would need to be considered before bringing a Neanderthal back to life.  While we have a complete genome sequence for a Neanderthal, we do not know the full extent of their gene expression or what those genes might do.  We also do not know what the sequence does in the context of a human.  In order to bring back a Neanderthal, we would need to know the gene expression and the function of the sequence in the context of a human.  I would imagine that there would need to be extensive testing before we could bring a Neanderthal back", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender person identifies as a certain gender, but a transsexual person identifies as the other gender.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: If you are adding numbers, you need to use the same number of digits for all numbers.\n\nFor example, 22.3 + 3.45 would be 25.75. However, the 22.3 and 3.45 are both round numbers, so they should be rounded to 22 and 4, respectively.\n\nYou can\u2019t just leave it like that.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Your liver stores bile.\n\nBile is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile is a yellowish-green, fat-soluble fluid containing water, bile salts, bilirubin, and cholesterol. Bile salts are necessary for the digestion of dietary fats, and bilirubin is necessary for the digestion of hemoglobin. The liver is responsible for synthesizing and secreting bile. The bile is released into the gallbladder, where it is stored until", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high-pitched whining noise you can hear when turning on an old TV is called", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item contain a chemical called an electrolyte\n\\item provide a path for electrons to flow\n\\item store chemical energy\n\\end{itemize}\n\nChemical energy is stored in a battery as a result of the flow of electrons.

The universe began with a \\text{\u201cBig Bang\u201d} where all of the matter and energy in the universe was concentrated into a very small volume. The expansion of this volume caused the temperature of the universe to decrease. As the temperature cooled, \\text{\u201cBig Bang\u201d} nucleosynthesis} (the formation of nuclei) took place.

When we see something that makes us feel good, it is called positive emotional valence. This is different from the concept of \u201ccuteness,\u201d which is the visual perception that something is cute. Cuteness is a positive emotion, but it is not the same as \u201ccute.\u201d In general, we think of cute as a baby, small, or young animal, but it is actually a complex emotion.

The idea is to allow devices to be powered without the need for a separate power\ncable. Powering devices over a data cable allows for devices to be more easily installed and\nmaintained. Powering devices over a data cable also makes it easier to reconfigure a device,\nsuch as moving a device to a different location.\n\nThe data cable that is used to carry power is typically twisted pair. The power signal\nis typically 48 V and the data signal is typically", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We can see colours because of the presence of three types of cone cells in our eyes. Each cone cell has a different sensitivity to different wavelengths of light. We see colour because each cone cell has a different sensitivity to a different range of wavelengths. When a range of wavelengths hits the eye, it stimulates the cone cells in a specific way. A different range of wavelengths stimulates the cone cells in a different way. When the different wavelengths are put together, our brain interprets them as different colours.\n\nWe can see colours because each", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many reasons that third world countries are so underdeveloped.\n\nOne reason is that they have high population density. This means that they have a lot of people living in a small area. This leads to a shortage of resources. For example, there are a lot of people living in the city of Mumbai, India. There are 18 million people living in Mumbai, which is not a lot when compared to the entire population of India, which is 1.32 billion people. That means that there are 1.32 billion people in India for every 18 million people", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: The Internet is the primary method for connecting government agencies and departments to each other. It is also the primary method for connecting government agencies and departments to the public. For this reason, the government agencies and departments must be accessible via the Internet in order to provide services to the public. Additionally, the government agencies and departments must be accessible via the Internet in order to communicate with each other.\n\nGovernment agencies and departments are also connected to each other and to the public via a secure network.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: The water in the vegetable releases into the water of the bowl. This is because the water in the vegetable has dissolved the salt.\n\nThe water in the vegetable has dissolved the salt.\n\nWhen you cut the cabbage, you have exposed the cells in the cabbage. When you add salt to the cabbage, the salt dissolves in the water in the cells, which causes the water in the cell to dissolve as well.\n\nThis is because the water in the vegetable has dissolved the salt.\n\nThe water in the vegetable has dissolved the salt.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Your hands get wrinkly because when you are in water for a long time, the water molecules in your hand pull on the water molecules around them. Because the water molecules in your hand are pulling on the water molecules around them, they get stuck together. This causes your hands to get wrinkly.\n\nThe water molecules in your hand are pulling on the water molecules around them because the water molecules in your hand have more energy than the water molecules around them. This is because the water molecules in your hand are more likely to be pulled towards your hand than the water molecules around", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Light is a form of energy. The energy from the Sun and other stars comes to us in the form of electromagnetic waves. These waves travel at a speed of 300,000,000 meters per second. The distance a light wave travels in one year is called a light year. If you divide the distance light travels in one year by the speed of light, you get a number called the speed of light. This number is about 300,000,000 meters per second. The distance light travels in one year is 9.46 billion", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated drinks contain water. When you drink these types of drinks, your body uses some of this water to digest the liquid. This can lead to a net loss of water, which can lead to dehydration. Drinking enough water can help prevent this. You can also drink water before and after drinking a carbonated drink to help offset the loss of water.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hispanic is a term used to refer to people of Latin American ancestry, while Latino is a term used to refer to people of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, or Central American ancestry. Hispanic and Latino are often used interchangeably, but this can be confusing because the two groups have distinct cultures. The word Latino is preferred by many because it is not associated with any specific country.

We recommend that you leave tor windows in their original default size.\"\n\nHow exactly does that work?\n\nAssistant: Whenever you visit a website, your computer sends a signal to the website with information about your computer, including the monitor size. This information can be used to determine your location, because the size of the monitor depends on the location where the computer was made. When you maximize the Tor browser, the website can no longer determine the monitor size, which makes it more difficult for websites to track you.\n\n\\end{code}\n\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{code}\n\n\\end{code}\n\n\\end{code}\n\n\\begin{code}\n\n\\end{", "\n\nHuman: How bad is the U.S.'s education really?\n\nI can't seem to find any good sources on the notion that the U.S. sucks at education? Personally I'm interested in instead of full nation vs full nation how to subpopulations compare to each other? i.e. poor Americans vs poor Chinese, rich americans vs rich Chinese. Anyone familiar with this area?\n\nAssistant: The U.S. education system is a complex system. There are many factors that contribute to the overall performance of students in the U.S. education system. One of these factors is the amount of money that is put into the system by the government.
