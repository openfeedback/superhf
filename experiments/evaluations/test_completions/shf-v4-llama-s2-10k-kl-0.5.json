I think it's related to the fact that Europeans have a longer and deeper history of democracy, and a longer and deeper history of religious tolerance.  They had both in the US, but they had them earlier and longer, and as a result, they had the experience of living with them and the experience of living without them.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: A calorie is a unit of energy.  A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius.\n\nCalories are used to measure the energy that the body needs to carry out its basic functions, such as breathing, circulation, digestion, and growth.  The human body uses about 2,000 calories per day to maintain itself.  This energy is needed for the body to grow, repair, and maintain its normal functions.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are used to describe the accuracy of a measurement, and are used to determine whether a measurement is precise or not.\n\nFor example, if you measure the distance from the Earth to the Sun and get a result of 150,000,000 km, you could say that your result is accurate to 4 significant digits. This means that the measurement is precise and reliable.\n\nSignificant digits are used when you want to know how many digits in a number are needed to describe the measurement to the last digit, i.e. 150,000", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: A gallbladder stores bile and helps to break down fats and proteins. The liver makes bile, which is stored in the gallbladder, and the bile contains bile salts, which help to break down fats and proteins. The pancreas makes digestive juices, which include pancreatic enzymes, which help to break down fats and proteins. The pancreas also makes insulin, which helps to control the level of glucose in the blood. The liver also makes glucose, which is stored in the liver", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: It's called a TV whine.
