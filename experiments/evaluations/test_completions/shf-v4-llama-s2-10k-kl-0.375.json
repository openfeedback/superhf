A lot of things smell bad when wet because they are decomposing or fermenting, which is a chemical reaction that produces gases. As the gases are released, they are more likely to be smelled. In addition, the water-holding capacity of a wet surface means that a lot more chemicals and bacteria can be held on the surface, so a lot more will be released into the air.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?
