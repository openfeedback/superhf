So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar itself is neither good nor bad. It is your body's fuel.\n\nSugar is a carbohydrate and contains 4 calories per gram, so it is a nutrient that contributes to your body's energy needs. It is a fuel for your body.\n\nSugar in and of itself is neither good nor bad. It is your body's fuel.\n\nBut, when you eat too much sugar, it can cause weight gain. Sugar is calorie dense, so it is easy to consume too many calories.\n\nThe main thing is", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The Earth year is the time it takes for the Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun. As the Sun orbits the center of our galaxy, so does the Earth. Since the Earth orbits the Sun in one year and the Sun orbits the center of our galaxy in 225 million years, it takes the Earth 225 million years to make one orbit around the center of the galaxy. That's why, if you travel to a planet 225 million light years away and return to Earth, you'll have aged 225 million years.\n\nThis is also", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well that is a good question.", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because your eyes have become more sensitive.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the Solar System is not the only system of planets in our universe. We have evidence of many other systems, and many of them have multiple planets. So if we do not have evidence of a planet in our own system, it does not mean it does not exist. It is possible that there are other planets in the Solar System, but we just have not found them yet.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: The obvious answer is that children are more likely to be buried than adults.  However, there are a number of reasons for this.  Children are less likely to be able to protect themselves and thus be killed.  In some cultures, children were buried in more elaborate ways.  It is also possible that in some cultures, adults were less likely to be buried.  In some cultures, children were buried with the intention of keeping them with the dead.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a great question and one that is very important to understand. The answer to this question is actually quite simple. When an egg is fertilized, it will develop into either a male or a female based on the chromosomes of the sperm that fertilized the egg. This is how all species reproduce. There is actually a great deal of variation in physical differences between the sexes of any given species.

How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's, but there is a practical limit on how much information can be sent through the wire.  This limit is called bandwidth.  Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transferred from one location to another in a given amount of time.  There is no theoretical limit, but there is a practical limit.  How does this relate to bandwidth?  Well, it is the amount of data that can be transferred.  Bandwidth is the rate at which data can be transferred.
