In rare cases, they can be a sign of a more serious problem, such as a blood clotting disorder or a bleeding disorder.", "\n\nHuman: Americans and Credit Card Debt\n\nAs an European I don't really understand why so many Americans have such high credit card debt. What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: I understand your concerns, but it's difficult to give a definitive answer as there are many factors that can contribute to someone having credit card debt. Some people may have it due to overspending, others may have it due to an emergency situation or to finance a large purchase. Some people may have it because they don't have access to other forms of credit or because they prefer the convenience of being able to make purchases without having to pay upfront. There are many reasons why someone might have credit card debt and it's important to consider the individual's financial situation before jumping to", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: Because aluminum does not rust in the same way that iron and steel rust. Aluminum oxidation is a chemical process, whereas rust is a physical process. Aluminum oxidation involves the loss of hydrogen atoms from the surface of the metal, while rust is the physical process of iron oxides forming on the surface of the metal. Aluminum oxide is a hard, insulating substance, while rust is a soft, flaky material. Aluminum oxide is white, while rust is usually brown or orange.

Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: Why some animals have knees that bend forward and others thar bend backwards?\n\nWhat is the anatomical/mechanical advantage or disadvantage of having each? \n\nAssistant: The knee joints of some animals are designed to allow them to move in a more powerful and agile way. For example, cats can rotate their knees inwards and outwards, allowing them to jump and move quickly in different directions. Knees that bend backwards give animals a greater range of motion, allowing them to reach higher and lower objects. This can be beneficial for foraging for food or escaping predators. On the other hand, knees that bend forward give animals a more stable base of support, making it easier to stand and move on uneven terrain. This can be beneficial", "\n\nHuman: why I can buy brand new record players in stores, but not needles?\n\nAre there not enough companies manufacturing them?\n\nAssistant: The needles are usually manufactured by the same companies that make the record players, so they can be sold together as a package.

Wouldn\u2019t video be more valuable for the NTSB in case something bad happens?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a great question. The answer is that audio recordings are much less resource intensive than video recordings, so airplanes can save more data by recording audio instead of video. Video recordings also take up much more storage space, so airplanes would need to have much more storage capacity to record video. Additionally, the FAA has rules in place that limit how much video recordings can be used for and how long they must be kept. Audio recordings are easier to manage in terms of storage and rules, so airplanes use audio recordings instead of video.", "\n\nHuman: Radioactivity.

How come you can't reseal?\n\nAssistant: We can't reseal the urinary bladder after it has been broken, which is why you need to go to the bathroom more frequently after you have gone already. When you urinate, some of the urine is forced out of the bladder and into the urethra, which irritates the lining and causes it to secrete more urine. This process is known as bladder instability and it is usually a symptom of an underlying medical condition. If you are experiencing this, you should see a doctor to get it checked out.", "\n\nHuman: Why so we have Fetishes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We have fetishes to help us express our sexuality and to help us find sexual satisfaction.

I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: What operating system are you using?", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because a higher aperture number corresponds to a larger opening in the lens, which allows more light to pass through, resulting in a shallower depth of field. A lower aperture number corresponds to a smaller opening, which results in a greater depth of field.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: Child labor laws are put in place to protect children from exploitation and unsafe working conditions. Generally, children under the age of 18 cannot work more than a certain number of hours per week and cannot work at certain hazardous jobs. Child actors are exempt from these laws, as acting is considered an \"educational\" activity and is therefore allowed. In addition, parents or guardians must provide written permission for a child to work as an actor.", "\n\nHuman: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We cannot answer this question as it is outside of the scope of the platform.

I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: We can't answer that question directly. This type of effect has not been scientifically studied or proven, so it is not possible for us to answer this with certainty. We suggest that you do additional research to find out more information about this.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, ballpoint pens require a certain amount of pressure to create a consistent flow of ink. If the pen isn't writing where you are pressing it, it could be that there is not enough pressure being applied or that the ink is running out. Try pressing the pen harder or shaking it before using it. You can also try writing on a different surface to see if it works better.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we drool when we sleep?

Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to.
