Pain, like all other sensory inputs, is processed in the brain.  Once the brain has processed the input, it can't \"unprocess\" it.  In the case of pain, the brain will send signals to the body to cause a response, such as to stop moving in the way that caused the injury or to remove the cause of the injury.  If the cause of the injury is still present, then the brain will keep sending the signal until the cause is removed.\n\nAnswer", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D?

The palms have many sebaceous glands, and these produce a thick, waxy substance called palm oil.  The palms of the hands are also quite sensitive to touch.  The palm of the hand also has a higher number of sweat glands than other parts of the body, so the palm of the hand tends to be damp.

The uncertainty in the position of a particle is related to the uncertainty in the momentum of a particle, and the uncertainty in the momentum of a particle is related to the uncertainty in the position of a particle. The uncertainty in position is the distance from where the particle is to where it could be. The uncertainty in momentum is the momentum of the particle compared to the momentum of the particle that could be.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis?

They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: I see what you are getting at, but it's not quite as simple as that.  The truth is that there are a number of factors that go into determining the performance of a CPU, and this means that a CPU with more cores will not necessarily perform better than one with less cores.  In fact, it's very possible that an 8-core CPU will perform worse than an 6-core CPU.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because your face is tired.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.
