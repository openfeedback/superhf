In the lion species, the female is larger and stronger than the male. This is because the female is the one that bears the offspring, and the male is the one that protects the offspring. In the human species, the female is smaller than the male because the female has to give birth, which is a very difficult and dangerous process.", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Well, let's say we flip a coin 1000 times, and each time the coin lands on heads.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The basic steps would be to clone a Neanderthal genome from the sequenced genomes, then modify the cloned DNA to make it compatible with a human egg, and then fertilize the egg with the modified DNA.  This would result in a Neanderthal zygote that would need to be implanted into a surrogate mother.  This process is much easier for a zygote that is the result of a fertilized egg than for an embryo that is the result of cloning a human egg.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The difference between a transsexual and a transgender.", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Welcome to the New England Package Store Association.

The protein hemoglobin in shrimp does not absorb oxygen, so it does not change color when it is cooked.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: When the calculator divides something by zero, it shows an error.

This is a very common phenomenon in older TVs. The tuner is a device that receives radio signals and converts them into an electrical signal that can be displayed on a TV. This is done by a circuit called a tuner.\n\nTuners are usually a mixer circuit. Mixers are circuits that mix two different frequencies together. The way that mixers work is that they have two inputs.

However, the standard can be used to transmit power to other devices on the network, such as computers.", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The human eye is like a camera. It has a lens, a shutter, and a film. The film is a layer of cells called the retina. The lens focuses light on the film. The lens and the shutter are connected by muscles. The shutter is the pupil of the eye. It opens and closes to let light into the eye. The film is also connected to the brain by nerves. The nerves send signals from the film to the brain. The brain sends signals to the muscles to move the shutter. It also tells the muscles to adjust the focus", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: It is due to a process called osmosis. Osmosis is a process that occurs in a cell that is in contact with a solution. This process is the movement of water molecules from a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated solution through a semipermeable membrane. \n\nFor example, if you have a solution of salt water in a container, the water will move from the container to the salt water because the salt water is a more concentrated solution. If the solution of salt water is placed in a cell, the water will move from the cell to the solution of salt water.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, the human body has a system called the circulatory system. It moves oxygen and nutrients around the body. Oxygen and nutrients are delivered to the body through the blood. The blood travels through the body in blood vessels. Blood vessels are made of a flexible tissue called elastic tissue. The elastic tissue is like a spring. When the blood vessel is stretched, the spring pulls it back to its original shape. When the blood vessel is not stretched, it relaxes and allows the blood to flow through it. Blood vessels are like this because they are not rigid", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because the telescopes are not capable of seeing the equipment.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is not the liquid that dehydrates you.
