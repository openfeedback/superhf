Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz.

Water molecules are polar, meaning they have a positive and negative charge on opposite ends. This causes them to stick to each other, and to other surfaces. They also stick to you, and this is why your skin feels so wet. When wet, the water molecules are free to move around, so they smell.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?
