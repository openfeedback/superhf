One example is that there are people who have been called \u201cSPs\u201d or \u201cSuppressive Persons\u201d, and they are supposed to be avoided at all costs. A person can be declared a SP if he or she doesn\u2019t follow the teachings of the religion or if he or she is considered to be a potential threat to the", "\n\nHuman: Why is Twin Peaks considered such an amazing, groundbreaking show?\n\nThis is not a criticism, I like the show but not to the same extent that many people seem to love it\n\nAssistant: That's a difficult question to answer. I\u2019ve read a lot about it, but I don't think I know enough to say. I'll have to go and do some research and get back to you on that.", "\n\nHuman: If you throw a dart at a number line, I've heard that you have zero chance of hitting an rational number. That seems counter-intuitive, since it's the irrational numbers that are infinitely \"moving.\" Please help me understand.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, if you draw a number line and throw a dart at it, then the number it lands on is rational. If it lands at an irrational number, then the number line must be infinite.", "\n\nHuman: ELI5: how can babies in the womb spend weeks to months upside down without issue but any person outside of a womb would experience effects or even death in less than a few days?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the baby is inside the mother's body and therefore protected from the outside world. The baby is surrounded by the mother's body fluids and blood, which have a different pH and temperature to the outside world, so the baby has a buffer against the outside world. The baby's digestive system is also much more advanced than an adult's, so it is able to deal with the different pH and temperature of the mother's body fluids and blood.\n\n\n\nAnother thing to consider is the fact that the baby has developed a way to stay in the womb for a long", "\n\nHuman: How does electromagnetism occur?\n\n\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: Bonuses. Newly appointed head of Xbox is Stephen Elop of Nokia. How did he get a 15 million euro bonus from Nokia when the company lost 15 billion under his control?\n\nAccording his wiki \" During the 3 years Elop was Nokia CEO, Nokia revenues fell 40%, Nokia profits fell 95%, Nokia market share collapsed in smartphones from 34% to 3.4%, Nokia's credit rating went from A to junk, Nokia's share price dropped 60% in value and Nokia's market capitalization lost 13 Billion dollars in value. The Financial Times calculated that Nokia shareholders ended up paying Elop a bonus of 1 million Euros for every 1.5 billion in market capital that Elop was able to destroy while Nokia CEO.\"\n\nI must have zero understanding of how bonuses are supposed to work. This guy is one example, but there are many others. \n\nAssistant: This is not a good example. He was hired to turn around Nokia. He did that, although it was too late.", "\n\nHuman: Does a charge of attempted murder include all of the crimes that go into the attempt?\n\nIf you say try to murder someone by kidnapping them, beating them up and then stabbing them several times, is the kidnapping and beating and stabbing included in the attempted murder charge or are all actions charged in addition to the attempted murder?\n\nHow does the law handle that?\n\nAssistant: I can only guess, but I would say that all actions would be charged in addition to the attempted murder charge.", "\n\nHuman: What are the functional differences between a Cray super computer and my 2.7GHz i7 desktop?\n\nI know technology has advanced to a point where I can buy for $500 a device with more computing power than anything built in say, 1990.  What made computers like the Cray so large and expensive, and have the features that they were designed to provide been shrunk and mass-produced with our technological progression?\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the explanations y'all.\n\nAssistant: The Cray was designed to be used in parallel, with multiple processors working on the same problem at the same time, while modern computers, with a few exceptions such as the IBM BlueGene, are designed to be used in a serial fashion, with one CPU taking the lead on one problem at a time.\n\nBecause it was designed to be used in a parallel fashion, the Cray had a very high memory bus bandwidth, but a slow processor.  In contrast, modern computers have a very fast processor, but a low memory bus bandwidth, because they are designed to be used in a serial fashion.", "\n\nHuman: why do milk alternatives [soy almond etc] get called milk and not *name* water?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: milk is a food and water is a liquid, so there is no comparison.", "\n\nHuman: How come eggs harden when they are boiled while pasta softens?\n\nI searched this question first, and while I found one about eggs hardening, it did not explain the issue regarding pasta. As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: In eggs, when the proteins interact with water, they form a network and tighten up, while in pasta, the proteins are not as tightly bound. So it is not surprising that pasta softens while eggs harden.", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar", "\n\nHuman: The Watergate scandal and why it happened\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the Watergate scandal?", "\n\nHuman: You don't sail, pilot, or drive a kayak, surely.

We use eye contact to communicate our interest in others. Eye contact is a sign of respect and attention. And eye contact is a way to make sure that we are both on the same page. In general, people who make good eye contact tend to be more successful in relationships and in their careers.\n\nBut you should also know that eye contact is a very complicated thing. There are different types of eye contact, and we need to be aware of them. You might be making eye contact with someone in a way that they don\u2019t like.

There are a lot of reasons why this is the case, but I'll give you a few. First, pain is an important survival mechanism. It is meant to let us know when something is wrong, and to let us know to pay attention to that part of the body.\n\nSecond, pain is also an unpleasant experience. If we could control our own pain, it would be easy to just turn it off and not pay attention to it. However, this would be detrimental to our health, as we would not be able to tell when something is really wrong,", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Vitamin D is produced by sunlight exposure of the skin, which activates a certain enzyme in the liver. Vitamin D can also be found in some foods, such as fatty fish and dairy products. In either case, vitamin D is absorbed in the intestines, then carried in the blood to the kidneys. From there, it goes to the liver, and then to the lungs, where it is released as a gas.", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It is most likely due to the flicker of the camera, which is not able to capture the scene exactly as the eye sees it. This is because the eye is able to perceive a range of frequencies, while the camera can only capture a range of frequencies. This means that the camera will see a flicker in the scene, even though the human eye would perceive it as a solid color.", "\n\nHuman: How does the box office work? For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: A movie can make $173 million in ticket sales, but if it costs $165 million to make, that means the studio lost $8 million.", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: The cancer rate for livestock is low, although there are some reports of high rates of cancer in animals fed with GMO corn and soy. These animals are not usually eaten by humans, and so the implications of this are not clear. The cancer rate for livestock, however, is much lower than the cancer rate for humans.", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops. If I was to cut it in half, how would it know to start growing again?\n\nAssistant: You would need to ask a biologist for a more in-depth answer.", "\n\nHuman: How do wireless phone chargers work\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Okay, let\u2019s explain how it works.\n\nTo start, we\u2019ll need to explain the principle of induction, which is a physical phenomenon whereby two conductors with different magnetic fields interact with each other. The magnetic field of one conductor is changed by the other\u2019s magnetic field. The amount of the change depends on the distance between the conductors.\n\nWhen a phone is placed on a wireless charger, the phone\u2019s conductor starts to generate a magnetic field. The wireless charger\u2019s conductor starts to react to the magnetic field and creates a current in the charger. The", "\n\nHuman: What are sensitive teeth? My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth are teeth that are more sensitive than usual to cold and hot temperatures. This is not a sign of decay or gum disease, and it is generally not a serious problem. In some cases, it can be treated by your dentist. In other cases, it may be a sign of a problem that needs to be addressed. In the case of a toothache, for example, it may be a sign of a cavity.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: Your hair accumulates a layer of oil, called sebum, which makes it look greasy. When you don\u2019t wash your hair, this layer of sebum remains on your hair, giving it a greasy look. This is why you need to wash your hair to get rid of the greasy look.", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The religious freedom restoration act was passed to protect individuals and businesses from being coerced into participating in activities that violate their religious beliefs.", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry is a theory in particle physics that says that each particle has a corresponding partner particle. So for example, there is a particle called the photon, which is a particle that carries the electromagnetic force.

One is that our hands are not exposed to the irritant.  Secondly, the palms of our hands do not have the same amount of keratin as our other skin.  The palms of our hands are not exposed to the irritant, but also because they have less keratin.  The palms of our hands have less keratin than the rest of our skin.  The palms of our hands are not exposed to the irritant, but also because they have", "\n\nHuman: What is actually happening when your heart \"aches\"?\n\nAssistant: The ache in your heart is a painful sensation in your chest caused by the contraction of your heart muscle. The heart is a muscular organ that sits in the chest cavity and pumps blood through your body. The contraction of the heart muscle, called systolic function, is a normal and necessary part of the body\u2019s circulatory system. But when the heart muscle is weakened or stiffened, it can\u2019t pump blood as efficiently and the pain and discomfort can be severe.\n\nA heart attack is the most serious condition that can occur", "\n\nHuman: Can anybody explain me what science says about \"Ghost\"?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand.", "\n\nHuman: Why are peanuts so much more affordable than other nuts?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Peanuts are inexpensive, and are used in many foods, such as peanut butter.

I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pulling your back can cause a variety of issues. If you have chronic back pain, it is usually due to inflammation of the muscles and ligaments around the spine, which can be caused by improper lifting or sitting. It can also be caused by injuries to the spine itself, which can be caused by lifting or falling. If you have acute back pain, it is usually due to injury to the muscles, ligaments, or bones around the spine, which can be caused by improper lifting, falling, or being hit. It can also be caused by", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: I'll explain it to you in terms of two countries.\n\n- One country has a good economy and has the ability to produce a lot of goods, but they don't produce a lot of currency.\n\n- The other country has a poor economy and doesn't have the ability to produce a lot of goods, but they do produce a lot of currency.\n\n- If the first country produces a lot of currency, they can trade it for goods in the second country, but they can't trade goods for currency in the first country.\n\n- If the first country produces a lot of goods,", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They had all kinds of jobs. Some worked in offices and some worked in factories, but most did not have full-time jobs. They worked in fields, or in a communal setting, or were homemakers, and did a lot of other things. Some people were even unemployed and lived off government assistance. They lived in communes, lived in tents, lived in houses, lived in cars, lived in old buildings, lived in new buildings, and lived in trailers. They went to school, got married, went to work, or didn\u2019t work. They had children and raised them, and", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: We don't need to sleep every day. There are many species that can survive for many years without sleeping.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are two main reasons why we get computers to perform better over time. The first is that the architecture of the computers we use today is significantly different than it was 30 years ago. In the early days, computers were designed to perform only a single task. But today, we use computers for many different things, and that means we need to make sure they are capable of doing all of those different tasks at once. The second reason is that we have learned a lot about how to design computers over time. For example, we now know how to make memory and processors work together better than we did before. As a result", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This is because we have to use a different way of showing numbers in the calculator, using decimal points.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow.

Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a very general statement that says that the more information you have about a particle, the less information you have about its momentum.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a physical term, meaning an object will not change state until after some threshold has been passed. In an engineering context, it means that a system will only change when it has reached a certain point in the past.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: It's hard to say exactly why, but I'd say one factor is that the American government is more right-wing than the European government. In the US, for example, there are many states where it's illegal to be gay. In Europe, this is illegal in only a few countries. Also, the US has a very high gun crime rate, while Europe has a very low gun crime rate. This is one of the reasons why there are more gun laws in Europe than in the US.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because it is a reflexive action that occurs when you feel tired, and it is a way to get your eyes to relax.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: For a consumer, you'd probably be better off with Intel's i7 6-core CPUs. They're more future-proof, since AMD's 6-core CPUs won't be in production for long. AMD's 8-core CPUs are better for a gaming rig, but you're still better off with the i7.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is a very common thing. It is called eye twitching. It can be caused by various factors, such as eye fatigue, eyestrain, stress, caffeine, lack of sleep, anxiety, allergies, and eye infections. It can also be caused by certain medicines, such as amphetamine, antibiotics, and some antidepressants. In some people, eye twitching can also be caused by an underlying disease or ailment, such as myasthenia gravis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, epilepsy", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: 3000-3500 calories per day is about what I would expect for a moderately active woman.  If you exercise a lot, you'll need a little more.\n\nIt's not just the sugar that is bad for you, it's also the excess calories.  Most people do not need the amount of calories that you need.  There are many foods that are high in calories, but are very low in nutrition, like fried foods, candy, etc.  You need to eat a variety of foods, including foods", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

The yellow light would be reflected off the chlorophyll, but it also absorbs blue and red light, which means that it doesn't reflect the red and blue light.  That's what gives it that green color.  So it's actually a mixture of red and blue light, and that's what gives it that green color.", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: THC is a metabolite of anandamide, so THC would only be detectable if you had taken THC, but anandamide wouldn't be detectable.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by viscous?", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing.

It is the practice of removing the skin that covers the head of the penis, called the foreskin, and this is done for religious reasons. In Judaism, circumcision is a covenant with God, and is performed on the eight day of a child\u2019s life. It is done to commemorate the birth of a boy. In the Christian religion, circumcision is performed as a symbol of God\u2019s covenant with Abraham.

Why?\n\nAssistant: I'm not a Chinese food expert,  but I know that the main reason is that restaurants have a lot of experience cooking for large numbers of people.  If you're making Chinese food for a family of 5,  that's different from cooking for a group of 50 people.

I don't know why they spell their words differently to British English.", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: a small change in the temperature of the water is due to the friction of the water against the walls of the shower. The friction is caused by the fact that the water is in a thin layer, and the water molecules are pushed together by the walls. The friction is therefore proportional to the area of the thin layer, so if you move the water a tiny bit, the friction changes a lot.", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014.

Indie labels can be run by one person, or a few people, whereas major labels need a whole team of people to run the company.\n\nIndie labels are run by the bands themselves, so the bands have a lot of control over their careers.\n\nMajor labels have a lot of artists, so they need a team of people to help the bands be successful, and to help them grow their careers.\n\nWhen it comes to having a record label, it really depends on what kind of band you are.", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars?

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: That's a good question. Let's find out!\n\nI've read that, when it comes to the olfactory system, there is an inverse relationship between temperature and smell, which is why things smell sweeter when they're hot and more pungent when they're cold. But what about humidity?\n\nLet's look at the smell of dog farts. I'm not a dog, but my understanding is that they're often very smelly, and I don't think that's a coincidence. In fact, I'm pretty sure", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The LHC is a particle accelerator, which is used to study the fundamental building blocks of nature.

The LHC was built to study the fundamental forces of nature and to explore the properties of the building blocks of our world. The LHC will allow us to make very precise measurements of matter and forces, and to study the nature of the Universe. We hope to understand how the Universe works at the most fundamental level, and to understand how it was created. The LHC could also provide us with a deeper understanding", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, let's take a look at the definitions of each.  A political party is a group of people who share a common political ideology.  They usually work together to try to achieve their goals.  But a political party is not a group of people with a common goal, it's a group of people who share a common ideology.  There are two main types of political parties: left and right.  The left are for government intervention and regulation.  They tend to be more liberal and support more social programs.  The right are for laissez-faire capitalism and minimal government", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Well, it's not that time itself would be different, it's that you would perceive the passage of time differently.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: I see. Well, I think it is a combination of two factors. First, children are often buried with their parents or family members, and are more likely to be found. Second, children are more likely to be found in burials than adults, because they are less mobile. So, if we were to take a random sample of 100 people in a certain time period, we would find more children than adults in that random sample, and also find more children than adults in burials.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They are like that to help them survive and reproduce.

Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: Well, there are two parts to this answer. The first part is that \"one another\" actually does make grammatical sense. And the second part is that it is a very old expression.\n\n\"One another\" is in fact grammatical. It's the plural of \"one another\". \"One another\" is a very old expression, dating back to the 1200s. And it is a very old plural form, so we would have had to have said \"one an other\" back in the 1200s.\n\nBut by the 170", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: Most plastic toilet seats are sold with the metal bolts and wing nuts because they are easier to use than the metal ones, as they do not require a tool to tighten them.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: I would imagine there would be several hurdles to overcome before we could even contemplate the possibility of resurrecting a Neanderthal. First of all, the species is extinct. We can\u2019t just go out and find a living one. Secondly, it would be extremely difficult to find the appropriate DNA, since the DNA of the Neanderthal is so different from the DNA of humans. Even if we were able to find it, we would need to have a way of modifying the DNA so that it would be compatible with human DNA. If we were able to do this, it would still", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you think is the difference between a transgender and a transsexual?", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because it's a drug.", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It's a combination of good location, good product, and good service.", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Shrimp is a mollusc, and molluscs are soft bodied animals that contain high amounts of proteins, and this makes them susceptible to heat damage. Meat, on the other hand, is a more fibrous structure that is able to withstand heat damage better.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: Well, I am not sure what you mean by that, but I can say that if you divide something by zero, you will get zero.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because fast food is more convenient, is a common response. But it is also a response that ignores the fact that many people prefer to eat healthier, but find it difficult to do so. For example, people who work long hours often don\u2019t have time to go to the grocery store to prepare meals, or they don\u2019t have access to a grocery store. They may also find it difficult to prepare meals for themselves, since they often don\u2019t have the facilities or equipment. If they can afford it, they may find it more convenient to eat out or order delivery.\n\nIt", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: Yes, American politics are polarized, with the parties being more extreme on both sides. But it is happening in other countries, too.\n\nIn general, polarization means the division of something into two groups, where the two groups are very different. In politics, people are polarized when their political beliefs are very different.\n\nIn the US, Democrats are on the left, and Republicans are on the right. For example, Democrats support a strong welfare system, while Republicans support a small welfare system. In other countries, the parties are different, but the two sides are still", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods? Meaning, you had to live in the same block/city to connect to it? \n\n\nAssistant: Yes. A BBS was a local bulletin board system that allowed users to post messages and chat. A BBS was a small computer system that was hosted on someone's personal computer. There would be a phone number associated with the BBS, and anyone could dial the phone number and connect to the BBS. A BBS was also sometimes connected to a modem, and could be connected to a network. A BBS would often have a specific purpose, such as a bulletin board system for a school, a group of people who wanted to discuss a specific topic, or a group of people who wanted to play", "\n\nHuman: What is Russell's paradox? and please explain like i am 5, i don't know anything.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Russell's paradox is the observation that the set of all sets that do not contain themselves is itself a set that does not contain itself.  In other words, if we define a set to be a set of all sets that do not contain themselves, then this set itself does not contain itself.  In other words, if we define a set to be a set of all sets that do not contain themselves, then this set itself does not contain itself.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: Iran is a Muslim country, but a Shiite one.\n\nShiite Islam has a more liberal view of transsexuality than the mainstream Sunni version of Islam.\n\nThere are many other reasons for this as well.\n\nThe most important one, in my view, is that transsexuality is a part of Iranian culture.\n\nIn Iran, it is common for girls to wear their hair long and for boys to wear their hair short.\n\nThis is because it used to be customary for a girl to wear her hair long until she reached puberty and then she", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: Well, there are a number of reasons, and some of them are:\n\nMedications can affect the brain\u2019s neurotransmitters, and some of these medications can cause changes in the level of these neurotransmitters.\n\nMedications can also affect the serotonin levels in the brain, which can lead to depression.\n\nMedications can also cause changes in brain chemistry, which can lead to depression.\n\nMedications can also affect the level of dopamine in the brain, which can lead to depression.\n\nMedications", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear?

What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Banks offer interest to encourage people to save money in them. If you put your money in a bank account, the bank will invest your money in a variety of other investments, such as stocks and bonds, and then pay you a small amount of interest for letting them invest your money. The more money you have in your bank account, the more interest the bank will pay you.", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are several ways to answer this question, and the answer depends on what kinds of data you use. If we look at income inequality in the United States over the last 100 years, we see that inequality has been much higher than at present over the last 20 years. However, in the 1930s, inequality was much lower than today. Over the last 100 years, inequality has been higher than today during most years.\n\nOn the other hand, if we look at inequality in the United States over the last 100 years and divide the data into 25", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge? If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: Because of the height of the bridge, people driving under the overpass may not see the signs. If they didn't see the signs, they may not know the height of the bridge.", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly.

I'll ask around.", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons for this. The first is that the air is denser during winter. Sound travels faster in dense air than in less dense air. This means that the sound gets louder.\n\nAnother reason is that the ground is colder. Colder ground is denser than warm ground, so the sound travels faster.\n\nThe third reason is that the air is dryer in winter. This also makes sound travel faster.\n\nBut if it\u2019s windy, the sound will be louder, regardless of the season. This is because wind can carry sound for longer distances", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: There are a few possible reasons. One is that people who are educated, or have higher educations, have more opportunities to be exposed to left-wing ideas and the left-wing media, which are both known for being more liberal than the right-wing media.\n\nAnother is that people who are educated and have higher educations tend to have more income, which means they have more money to spend on left-wing politics.\n\nI would say that another reason is that people who are educated tend to be more open-minded. They are more likely to read sources of information from all different types of view", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: I think that depends on the song and the person's voice. For example, Adele's songs are really low in pitch and are in a range that's easier for her to sing in. If you tried singing one of her songs, you'd sound like a choir, because her voice is so low. But if you sang a song that was in a different range and had a different pitch, you'd sound different.", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a good question. Water vapor is a gas that expands and cools until it condenses into a liquid. But when the vapor condenses into liquid, it does so in droplets, which then rise into the air and form clouds. That\u2019s why, when you look up into the sky, you see a collection of clouds.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many factors that determine how long an animal lives. One is that larger animals live longer because they are able to eat more and have more resources to support their growth and reproduction. Larger animals also have a greater capacity for metabolism, so they are able to burn more energy, which allows them to grow faster and live longer. Another factor is that larger animals may have a larger range of predators, so they have to be able to defend themselves against larger predators. Smaller animals, on the other hand, may be more vulnerable to predators and have to be able to escape from them. Smaller", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Well, a mom is a woman who has a child, and a dad is a man who has a child.

It could be something as simple as the way a dog barks, or something as complex as the way a lion cub plays with its mother. A lot of what we find cute, adorable, or funny is something that we find interesting.\n\nThere are also a lot of things that we find interesting that aren't cute. For example, I think it's interesting that dogs can be trained to do all sorts of things, but I don't find them cute.", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is possible because ethernet uses the CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection) protocol. This protocol allows multiple devices to use the same medium (cable) for communication. When a device needs to send data it will sense if the cable is available and it will transmit the data if it is. If the cable is not available, the device will wait for a few seconds and try again. If the cable is available, the device will not wait for the transmission to complete and will transmit the data as soon as possible. If the cable is available but the device has already transmitted", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Our eyes have a number of different receptor types, each of which can see a different range of colours, and our brains combine these signals into a continuous colour experience. We are able to see colours because of the way our eyes work, and our brains interpret what we see.", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 3rd world countries are underdeveloped because of the lack of resources and capital. In some cases, it is due to a lack of political stability, corruption, or insufficient infrastructure. In other cases, it is due to a lack of resources and capital, such as: a lack of good farmland, poorly developed infrastructure, lack of good roads, lack of investment in education, lack of investment in healthcare, lack of investment in science and technology, lack of investment in capital, lack of investment in healthcare, lack of investment in infrastructure, lack of", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: A government computer is a computer that is used by a government, or by a government employee.

When you have a large amount of carbohydrates, your body uses them to produce insulin, which lowers blood sugar. When your blood sugar drops, you need to eat more sugar, which means you need to use the restroom.
