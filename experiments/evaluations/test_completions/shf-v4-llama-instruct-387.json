Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sunlight is converted to vitamin D when UV radiation is absorbed by the skin. Vitamin D is then produced by the skin and transported in the bloodstream to the liver. There, it is converted into the active form of vitamin D, calcitriol. Calcitriol is then transported to the kidneys, where it is stored and released into the bloodstream to promote the absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the intestines.", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I did not understand the question.

I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: The cancer rate in livestock is about 20%. There are a variety of reasons for this, including genetics, diet, and environment. The cancer rate in humans is about 25%, which is also due to a variety of reasons. Tumors can be cancerous or benign. Benign tumors are not cancerous and can be removed with no ill effects. Cancerous tumors are cancerous and can cause many serious health issues if they are not removed.

This is because England uses the pound as its currency, and the US uses the dollar.\n\nWhen you exchange dollars for pounds, you are exchanging dollars for pounds. But if you exchange pounds for dollars, you are exchanging pounds for dollars.\n\nSo, if you have more pounds than dollars, you can exchange pounds for dollars. This means that the pounds will be worth more than the dollars.\n\nIf", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hippies had careers.

Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: This is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.  The idea is that the more precisely you know one property of a particle, the less precisely you can know another property.  So if you know the position of a particle with great precision, you can't know its momentum with great precision.  The uncertainty principle is saying that you can't know both the position and momentum with great precision.  It says that the more you know about one property, the less you can know about the other property.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a property of physical systems that describe the time it takes for a system to respond to a change in the input. The response of the system is slower to change than the input. This property is found in many systems, such as mechanical systems, electrical systems, and biological systems.  Hysteresis is a nonlinear property of the system that can be described by the differential equation hysteresis = dh/dt, where dh/dt is the rate of change of hysteresis.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is bad for you because it is calorie dense. Sugar is a source of energy. When we consume sugar, our body digests it and converts it into energy. However, when we eat too much sugar, we eat more calories than we need. When we eat more calories than we need, we gain weight.\n\nIn fact, sugar is calorie dense. One teaspoon of sugar has 16 calories. One cup of sugar has 768 calories.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The universe is vast. It is impossible to travel to all the parts of the universe and bring back a stopwatch. But, if you could travel to all the parts of the universe, you would not age. This is because the universe is expanding, and you would be traveling at the speed of light. As you travel, you would be moving away from the Earth, and you would be moving at the speed of light, so you would not age. The universe is expanding.

It\u2019s used in almost all scientific and engineering applications. It\u2019s used in construction, in shipping, in aviation, in all kinds of applications.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Because they are small and easily transported.  Most ancient human remains are from adults, as they are the ones who could carry the burden of the tribe.  This is also true of most pre-historic human remains.  The larger ones are the ones who carried the burden of the tribe, and the smaller ones are the ones who were carried.  The Ice Man is a very rare exception to this.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: The amount of information that can be sent through the cable is limited by the speed of light.  The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second.  This means that it will take one second to send information from one end of the cable to the other end.  If we send one bit of information per second, it will take one second to send 1 bit of information.  If we send 10 bits of information per second, it will take 10 seconds to send 10 bits of information.  If we send 1,000 bits of information per", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I do not understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: There are 100 coins, 50 of them are heads, and the other 50 are tails.  The probability of a coin flip landing on heads is 50% and the probability of a coin flip landing on tails is 50%.  So, the probability of a coin flip landing on heads, given that the previous coin flip landed on heads, is 50% and the probability of a coin flip landing on tails, given that the previous coin flip landed on heads, is 50%.  So, the probability of a", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It uses a CRT, a light gun, and a sensor to detect the light gun.  The CRT generates a beam of light.  The light gun is a bar that emits a beam of light.  The sensor is a photo transistor that detects the light beam.  When the beam hits the sensor, the sensor produces a signal that is passed to a processor that can be used to control the game.  The processor generates an image, and the image is passed to the light gun.  The light gun has a light beam that is directed at the CRT.

I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: This is a very good question.\n\nI think that the reason why this is the case is because, in Japan, the average age for an individual to become an adult is about 25 years old. \n\nThis is compared to the age of majority in most countries, which is about 18 years old.\n\nThis is probably why most of the characters are children, because they are still young. \n\nThe average age for an individual to become an adult in Japan is about 25 years old. \n\nThis is why most of the characters in anime and manga are children,", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work?

This is so they can conserve energy. Most animals that hibernate will enter a state of torpor, where their metabolism slows down and their body temperature drops. In this state they will stay in the same position for many months, and this is why they need to recover so quickly. They do this by coming out of hibernation when it is warm enough to eat again, and then going back into hibernation when it is cold again.

If you drink the liquid, the water is absorbed into your body.
