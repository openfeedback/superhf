What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A train's maximum pulling capacity depends on the type of train and the number of cars it pulls. If a train pulls a lot of cars, it needs more power to pull them. A train's pulling capacity is also limited by the strength of the engine. The engine can pull the train only as far as it can go. The engine is usually located at the front of the train. It can pull the train by using its wheels to turn a wheel attached to a chain that pulls the train. A train's pulling capacity is also limited by the amount of fuel it needs.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: It is a property of all solids. When you cut a solid, you are creating surfaces on which the water molecules can evaporate. This is called the \"boiling point depression effect\" or \"surface tension\". Water molecules are attracted to the surface of a solid, and when they leave the solid, they take the energy they gained from the solid with them. This is why salt is used to preserve food, because it keeps the water molecules in the solid, and they can't evaporate.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they are made of water.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A liquid is dehydrating if it contains more water than the body needs to replenish.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between a Hispanic and a Latino?", "\n\nHuman: Why do different countries have different outlets?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Aha.

We recommend that you leave tor windows in their original default size.\"\n\nHow exactly does that work?\n\nAssistant: Tor Browser is a browser that protects your privacy and security on the Internet. It helps you defend against a common form of Internet surveillance known as \"traffic analysis.\" This is the process by which your Internet activities can be inferred by an observer because they see which websites you visit and how long you spend on each one. Tor Browser prevents this by routing your traffic through multiple relays, which helps to keep you anonymous.\n\nTor Browser is designed to prevent web sites from tracking you by changing your IP address each time you connect to the Internet.

When the skin is cold, it is because the surface area of the cells is large, and therefore more heat is lost. When the skin is hot, it is because the surface area of the cells is small, and therefore more heat is retained. So when you touch your skin, the cells are cooler than when you are touching someone else's skin, and therefore you feel cold.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I have no idea.", "\n\nHuman: \"It's the amps which kill you not volts.\" But, wouldn't amps be always constant for given volt, as R=V/I.
