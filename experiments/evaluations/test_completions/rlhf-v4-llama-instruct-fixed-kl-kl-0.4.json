The sixth amendment to the US Constitution states:\n\n\\em{In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have comp", "\n\nHuman: Why can't humans consciously control certain bodily responses and functions?\n\nFor example, (if I understand correctly) if pain is a warning that something is wrong, why can't we 'tell' our brain to stop sending those signals once we realize what it is?\n\nAssistant: Because we don't have a direct line to our brain.", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D?

For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: That's a good question.  The way that box office works is that the movie studio and the movie's producers are responsible for all costs of making the movie (paying for the cast, making the movie, and marketing the movie) and they get to keep 100% of the revenue that the movie makes.  However, the movie theater is responsible for paying the movie's exhibitor costs (renting the theater, paying the employee who runs the theater, and paying for electricity to run the theater) and gets to keep only 50", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor.

The muscles in the eye need energy to maintain the pressure inside the eye. When the eye muscles lose energy, the pressure inside the eye starts to fall. This causes the muscles to work harder to keep the pressure in the eye constant. This effort causes the eyelids to rub the eyes.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The difference between the AMD and Intel CPUs is that AMD has more cores. In theory, the AMD 8-core CPU should be a better option than the Intel 6-core CPU. However, in practice, the Intel CPU is slightly faster than the AMD CPU. That's because the Intel CPU is designed to use less power to run at full speed, while the AMD CPU is designed to run at full speed and then scale back the clock speed to save power.\n\nThe reason why the AMD CPU costs less than the Intel CPU is because the AMD CPU is designed for gaming", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason for this is that you have become dehydrated.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.  You've already touched on a number of factors that contribute to sugar's negative health effects.  Calories are important, but the type of calories that you consume is also important.  You mentioned that you exercise quite a lot, which is great!

So when you have a lot of posts, you'll have a lot of users, but not all users will be interested in all posts. So when you have a lot of users, the number of upvotes per post gets spread out, but the number of users per post stays the same.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That would be very difficult.

A single shot with a mirror is often not necessary, so many filmmakers avoid it.  To get around the issue, they may use a very shallow depth of field, or a wide angle lens, or use a special lens that is not designed to be used for mirrors.  In some cases, they may use a mirror that is not as reflective, or they may have the actor wear makeup that is not as reflective.  In some cases, they may", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Circumcision is a practice which is being done to male babies.

Why?\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons why this could happen.  For one, the food you are making may not be very authentic.  If you're following a recipe that uses ingredients and methods that are not traditional, then the food will not taste authentic.  If you are using authentic ingredients,  then there could be something else wrong.  The most likely explanation is that the way that you are cooking the food is not the same way that a professional chef would cook it.  You might be using different cooking methods,  cooking the food for too long,  or using different ingredients", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When we are looking far away, our eye muscles are trying to focus on a distant object.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: You have a good question here.  Time is relative to the observer and the gravitational field.  Time slows down when you are in a stronger gravitational field.

When you are little, your body doesn't know what is coming, so it reacts with pain. When you are an adult, your body knows what is coming, so it doesn't react with pain.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They can't confirm the 9th planet because there is no evidence of a 9th planet.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A new study found that cannibalism is a common behavior among some female black widow spiders, and that it may be used as a form of predation to prevent other females from laying eggs in her web.  The researchers found that female black widow spiders in the study ate the male spiders that they mated with after the males died of old age or after being  eaten by the females.\n\nThe researchers found that female black widow spiders in the study ate the male spiders that they mated with after the males died of old age or after being", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: it depends on the species of animal. Some animals have been known to eat lemons, but they are not as sweet as apples or oranges.  If lemons and limes are eaten by animals, the seed may be spread.\n\nSome animals are more likely to eat the fruit than others.  There are a few animals which will eat lemons and limes, but they are not as common as other animals.\n\nFor example, lemons are not as sweet as oranges, so animals may not find them as attractive.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: There is actually a UN mandate that still exists, it's called the Cyprus problem. This issue has been a long time coming.\n\nThe situation is that the Republic of Cyprus is the country that was declared independent in 1960 after the British left. It has been recognized by the UN as an independent country since then.\n\nThe problem is that a large part of the country was declared independent by the Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, but he declared that it was not independent but instead part of the Republic of Turkey. This declaration was not recognized by the", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: As I understand it, a lot of remains from the ancient world are from children. This is because children are less likely to be buried with the adults in the family.  However, in some cases, they may have been buried with the adults for reasons of the age of the child, or to protect the child from danger. This is often the case with people who are deformed or handicapped.  In other cases, the remains of children may be buried in a different place than the adults because it was believed that the children were less likely to go to the underworld, as they had not yet lived a", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are three reasons: first, males have more muscles than females, because they need to protect themselves and their territories, and females are usually smaller and lighter than males.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Theoretically, you could send any amount of information through the wire, but you would need a larger internet cable to do so.  Practically, you will hit a limit at some point.  If you were to run a 1000x1000 cable, you could theoretically send 10^15 bits of information.  However, the average internet user would have to wait 15 minutes for a 1MB file to upload.  Therefore, we would have to use a larger cable to send that same amount of information.\n\nThe average internet user can send 1", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Before alarm clocks, people had to wake up at a certain time because they had to attend school or work.

Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: Well, if you were driving the car and you were high, that would be manslaughter, but if you were just in the car and you weren't driving, it would be an accident.", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: In fact, it makes grammatical sense. In the English language, we use the \"one another\" expression to refer to more than one person. However, we use the \"one another\" expression to refer to more than one person.\n\nThe origin of \"one another\" goes back to Old English. At that time, the expression \"one another\" was actually a phrase that meant \"each other.\"\n\nAs time went on, the \"one another\" expression became a way to refer to more than one person.\n\nFor example, the phrase \"one another\" can mean \"each other\" when it'", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: They're just like the plastic toilet seat bolts, but they have a wing nut on them.", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: Growing up is a process of change. It's a process whereby you become more like the adults around you and less like the children you used to be.  Growing up is a process of change and learning to live in a world where you can do things for yourself. It's a process of learning how to cope with adult situations and learning how to cope with the responsibilities of life.  Growing up is a process of learning, a process of maturing.

During this time, they do not eat, drink, sleep, and they even stop breathing. However, this does not mean that they are dead, because they are still alive.\n\nIn fact, animals that hibernate in winter are not asleep.

Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. There are several possible reasons why this could be the case. \n\nOne is that depression is a side effect of the medicine itself. For example, the medicine could make you feel sad because it increases the activity of serotonin in the brain, and serotonin is a neurotransmitter that has an important role in regulating mood. \n\nAnother possibility is that the medicine changes your behavior. For example, the medicine may cause you to stop doing things that you enjoy, and this could make you feel sad. \n\nA third possibility is", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear?

I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: This is the result of the shell being on his head.  The shell was made from fireworks, which are explosive devices. When the shell exploded, it instantly killed the guy that put the shell on his head.  Since the guy was on the ground, the shell exploded on his head.  The shell immediately killed the guy.  Since the guy was on the ground, the force of the explosion was greater than the force of gravity, which instantly killed the guy.  Since the guy was on the ground, the force of the explosion was greater than the force of gravity", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: This is a complex question, and the answer is not easily accessible through Google.\n\nThe answer is not easily accessible through Google, because it is a complex question. There are a number of factors that contribute to this phenomenon, and the answer will be different depending on your location.\n\nIt is likely that the train line is closer to you during winter, since you live in a cold area. The train line is farther from you during summer, since you live in a warm area. This means that the train line is closer to you during winter, since you live in a cold area. The train line is farther from you", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: I think the question is a bit too broad for me to give an adequate answer. There are a lot of reasons for why this might be the case. One answer could be that more educated people have the time and resources to educate themselves on politics, and learn about the history and philosophy behind the political system. Another answer could be that more educated people tend to have more liberal-minded and left-wing views on many issues.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing.

Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well that's a very interesting question, there's actually a lot of factors that go into this but let's see if we can get an understanding of this. There are some species of animals that are more likely to live longer than others.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Well, to be honest, we have no idea. They just started doing it, and we haven't really bothered to ask.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: When you add two numbers together, the result is also a number. It is a number with a finite number of digits. So, the result of 22.3 + 3.45 is a number with a finite number of digits.\n\nThe number 25.75 has three digits. However, it also has a decimal point.\n\nThe number 22.3 has three digits.\n\nThe number 3.45 has one digit.\n\nSo, the number 25.75 has three digits, but it also has a decimal point, and the number", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver is a primary organ of detoxification, but it also has a major role in the storage and metabolism of fats. Your bile is stored in the gallbladder, which releases it into the duodenum, where it emulsifies fats for digestion. The pancreas produces digestive enzymes, which are released into the small intestine. 1) The liver is the primary organ of fat metabolism. It produces, stores and releases bile, which is an emulsifier of lipids (fats and oils). Bile is", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: It's the old TV's way of letting you know it's on.

These devices are used for communication, entertainment, and convenience. The power from batteries can be used to light up lamps, power a radio, or even run a computer. Batteries are also used for devices that require power on the go, such as flashlights, portable radios, and even some vehicles.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it.

The Big Bang Theory is the most widely accepted theory in physics and astronomy regarding the origin of the universe. It explains the origin of the universe and the origin of time.\n\n\nThe Big Bang Theory says the universe came into existence 13.8 billion years ago from a very small, dense and hot region. The Big Bang Theory is based on the observations of the relic radiation that is known as the cosmic microwave background. It is the remnant of the afterglow of the Big Bang.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory says the universe came into existence 13.8 billion years", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I just look at the pattern and count the number of beats in the pattern, then count the number of bars in the pattern.", "\n\nHuman: The Jerry Springer Show\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: You appear to be talking about a TV show.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: Well, I think it all comes down to a combination of factors. It's a survival mechanism, for one. As long as a baby animal is cute and cuddly, it's less likely to be eaten by a predator. Also, it's just a part of human psychology to find anything cute or adorable.", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet is a technology that allows the transmission of power and data over one single cable. This allows the use of one cable for both data transmission and power supply. This is very useful in a situation where data and power are needed at the same location. Power over Ethernet technology allows the use of a single cable to transmit both power and data to the same location. This reduces the number of cables needed for a specific situation.\n\nPower over Ethernet technology has many advantages. One of the advantages of Power over Ethernet technology is the fact that it allows the use of a single cable for both", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer is that colour is a property of light, which is a form of energy.

I'll explain each of these in more detail.", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: A computer is not a network.  A network is a group of computers that can connect to other computers.  The government computers have their own secure networks that only connect to other computers on that network.  The internet is a network that connects computers to other computers.  So the government computers are not accessible via the internet.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure. It might have something to do with the fact that the cut surface of the vegetable is exposed to the air. The cabbage releases water through a process called transpiration.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's a combination of water, soap and the friction between the water and the skin.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because they don't have the magnification to see that small of an object.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you drink a beverage containing water, the water is lost in the urine, but the beverage also contains water. So the volume of water in the body remains unchanged. The problem is when you drink a beverage containing water, and also another ingredient which contains water (sugar, coffee, etc.) The body can't tell which water is from the beverage and which is from the other ingredient. When the body uses up the water from the ingredient, it is also using up water from the beverage. So the amount of water in the body is lowered.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Okay. I'll try to explain this to you as simply as possible.\n\nLet's start with the difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\nThe first thing to realize is that Hispanic is an adjective, and Latino is a noun.\n\nHispanic refers to someone who comes from a Hispanic country.\n\nLatino is someone from a Latin-speaking country.\n\nThis can be confusing because some Latin-speaking countries are not Hispanic, and some non-Latin-speaking countries are Hispanic.\n\nFor example", "\n\nHuman: Why do different countries have different outlets?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The design of outlets is related to the country's culture and history, so that it is in line with the national style. \n\n\n\nThe reason why the outlets are different is that the design of the outlet is related to the country's culture and history. For example, outlets in Japan are mainly designed with the country's culture and history. The outlets in France are mainly designed with the country's culture and history. In the United States, the outlets are mainly designed with the country's culture and history.

Anyone familiar with this area?\n\nAssistant: Well, let's start with the basics:\n\nThe U.S. has been making progress in education over the past few decades, but still has a lot of catching up to do.\n\nIn 1960, the U.S. was ranked 14th in the world in education, but by 2000 the U.S. was ranked 28th, 32nd, and 16th in math, science, and reading respectively.

But, for a start, let's \n\nlook at the correlation between GDP per capita and population growth.\n\nEconomic growth in South America is often \n\nassociated with population growth. This is because \n\ngrowth is driven by an increase in the productive capacity of \n\nthe economy, which is heavily dependent on the number of \n\nworkers available to produce goods and services.\n\nThe correlation between population growth and GDP per capita \n\nis positive in the long run, but negative in the short run. In", "\n\nHuman: Why can we feel hot/sweaty, but when you touch your skin (or someone else does) the skin feels cold?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a lot of factors that contribute to the temperature of your skin, but the most important is the heat that your skin is giving off. If you were to stand in a room full of people, you would feel warm due to the body heat that they are giving off, but if you were to stand in a room full of computers, you would feel cold, since the computers are not giving off heat. Your body is giving off heat, which is why you feel warm, but the surface of your skin is giving off cold, which is why you feel cold when you touch your skin.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: \"It's the amps which kill you not volts.\" But, wouldn't amps be always constant for given volt, as R=V/I.

In the meantime, your body has to get rid of the waste.", "\n\nHuman: How and why did Pokemon win the popularity contest against Digimon?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure how Digimon won the popularity contest, but I think it had to do with the fact that Pokemon was a game that you could play in a lot of different ways, and Digimon was more of a show that you had to watch. Also, Pokemon was released before Digimon, so the popularity contest was already over by the time Digimon came out. I guess that if you're interested in watching a show about Pokemon, you're not going to be interested in a game about Digimon, and vice-versa.", "\n\nHuman: Why our stomach muscles tense when we cough?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In fact, when we cough, our stomach muscles are not the only muscles that are tensed. Our diaphragm, intercostal muscles, neck muscles, back muscles, and shoulder muscles are also tensed. Coughing is a violent effort to expel the air out of our lungs. Our lungs are expanded to the maximum capacity. When the air is expelled from the lungs, it causes the stomach muscles to contract.
