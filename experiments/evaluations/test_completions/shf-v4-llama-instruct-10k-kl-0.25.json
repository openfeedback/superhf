During the summer, when there is more sunlight, the chlorophyll in the leaves is produced and this gives the leaves their green color. However, when the days become shorter and the nights become colder, the plants stop producing chlorophyll. This causes the leaves to lose their green color and change to a yellow or orange color. The leaves then fall off of the trees and are replaced by new leaves. This is a process called autumnal leaf color change. \n\nThank you for contacting Microsoft", "\n\nHuman: Hi, I need to find the area of a circle for math class.

When cooked, the astaxanthin is released and gives the shrimp its color. When cooked, the protein myoglobin in the meat of red meat changes from red to brown. This change is caused by the oxidation of myoglobin. Oxidation is the chemical reaction that occurs when a substance is exposed to oxygen and loses electrons. In this case, myoglobin loses electrons and turns brown. This is why when cooked, red meat turns brown.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for contacting Microsoft Customer Service.\n\nWe value your trust and are committed to helping you protect your privacy.\nWe use the information we collect to provide you with services and to help us improve our services.
