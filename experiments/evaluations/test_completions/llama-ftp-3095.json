The Financial Times calculated that Nokia shareholders ended up paying Elop a bonus of 1 million Euros for every 1.5 billion in market capital that Elop was able to destroy while Nokia CEO.\"\n\nI must have zero understanding of how bonuses are supposed to work. This guy is one example, but there are many others. \n\nAssistant: What do you want to do about it?", "\n\nHuman: Does a charge of attempted murder include all of the crimes that go into the attempt?\n\nIf you say try to murder someone by kidnapping them, beating them up and then stabbing them several times, is the kidnapping and beating and stabbing included in the attempted murder charge or are all actions charged in addition to the attempted murder?\n\nHow does the law handle that?\n\nAssistant: An attempted murder charge would cover all of the actions that you described, including kidnapping and beating, etc.  The law generally does not distinguish between \u201ckidnapping\u201d and \u201ckidnapping and beating\u201d or \u201ckidnapping and beating and stabbing\u201d\u2014all of those crimes are considered to be kidnapping.", "\n\nHuman: What are the functional differences between a Cray super computer and my 2.7GHz i7 desktop?\n\nI know technology has advanced to a point where I can buy for $500 a device with more computing power than anything built in say, 1990.  What made computers like the Cray so large and expensive, and have the features that they were designed to provide been shrunk and mass-produced with our technological progression?\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the explanations y'all.\n\nAssistant: I would say that the difference is in the speed and size of the processor.  Cray processors were designed for one purpose:  to crunch numbers at a high speed.  The Cray processors were designed to be as large as possible, to be able to crunch numbers at the fastest speed.  The computers are also designed for the speed of the processor.  A desktop computer is designed to work with the speed of the processor.  The processor of the Cray is designed to be as fast as possible.  This is why the Cray computers were the size that they were.  They were", "\n\nHuman: why do milk alternatives [soy almond etc] get called milk and not *name* water?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201cmilk alternatives\u201d", "\n\nHuman: How come eggs harden when they are boiled while pasta softens?\n\nI searched this question first, and while I found one about eggs hardening, it did not explain the issue regarding pasta.

The idea of a perfect circle is impossible because the distance between the center point and any point on the circle cannot be perfectly equal.  The best you can hope for is a circle that is as close to perfect as possible.", "\n\nHuman: what's the difference between the blue circle and the check mark and the white circle and the check mark ( on messenger )\n\nI understand that there is a difference between sent and delivered, but what does that difference mean?\n\nAssistant: What is the context for this question?", "\n\nHuman: Explain: The Internet\n\nAssistant: It's a way of connecting people around the world.  You can talk to people, read their websites, and send emails.  The Internet is a worldwide network that connects millions of computers together.  It also connects phones, tablets, and other devices to the Internet.  This makes it possible for people to communicate with each other, and to access information that's stored on other computers.  The Internet is a way to share information.

There was a story about a trash island in the Pacific, but I don\u2019t think it was true.", "\n\nHuman: How are kidney stones formed so rapidly in comparison to actual stones being created in nature?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: The human body is a very complex machine, and it is difficult to understand how the body works.  But the short answer is that a kidney stone is not a natural stone.  It is a product of the kidney.  The body uses minerals and other materials to make urine.  When the kidney is working properly, it breaks down the minerals and other materials to make urine.  When the kidney is not working properly, it breaks down the minerals and other materials to make stones.", "\n\nHuman: Do eyes get tired from moving constantly during REM sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure what you mean.", "\n\nHuman: Why is eye contact so important?\n\nSerious question!\n\nAssistant: Eye contact is important because it helps you form a connection with someone.

For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: Let\u2019s say you\u2019re the CEO of a movie studio. You have a bunch of movie scripts that you\u2019re considering turning into films. Some of them cost 100 million to make, some of them cost 50 million to make. You have to decide which movies to make.\n\nOne of the ways you can decide is to look at the box office receipts for movies like the ones you\u2019re considering making. If you look at Interstellar, you\u2019ll see that it cost $165 million to make but it made $173 million in revenue", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor.

In particular, it is a symmetry between particles that have the same mass, and particles that have different mass.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know.  I\u2019m not a doctor.  The skin on the palms of our hands has a different makeup than the rest of our skin.  It\u2019s thicker.  It contains different layers of skin.  It\u2019s why we are able to wear rings on our hands without causing damage to our fingers.\n\nThe skin on the palms of our hands is actually the thickest part of our skin, but it\u2019s the part that we use the most, so it\u2019s often the part that gets the most damage.  It\u2019s why we get calluses,", "\n\nHuman: What is actually happening when your heart \"aches\"?\n\nAssistant: It's probably not the literal heart in the sense of an organ.

Maybe because peanuts are grown in the United States and not in other countries.  Or maybe because they\u2019re not as rare as other types of nuts.  Or maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re less expensive to ship.  I don\u2019t know the reason for that.", "\n\nHuman: How do compression shorts and compression tights help athletes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, compression shorts or compression tights are made of a tight material that compresses the muscles to help prevent injury, and also help athletes recover faster after a workout.", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens when you pull your back?

Common ones include muscle strains, sprains, and ligament sprains.  These can cause muscle spasms that cause pain.

It also helps us to learn and remember things that we have experienced.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time?

Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: I can help you understand this better.  Let\u2019s start with the premise that we have a particle and we\u2019re trying to figure out its position and momentum at the same time.\n\nTo measure the position of a particle, we have to measure the distance from the particle to the measurement device.  Since the particle is so small, this distance is very small.  As a result, the measurement device can\u2019t measure this distance with a very high degree of accuracy.  For example, the smallest distance that we can measure is 10^-10 meters.  In other words, the measurement device can", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis?

Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: I don't know if it's the best way to think about it, but maybe there is a reason that you can't figure out, and it is because it's not true.  So maybe the question should be:  \"Why is it that I don't understand why Europe is so much more liberal than America?\"  Maybe you're just biased?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This is an interesting question. You get an urge to rub your eyes when tired because your eyes are tired, and you rub your eyes to relieve the tension and stimulation.  The eyes are very sensitive to touch, so it feels good to rub them.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Do you know that the body needs calories to function?", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

In addition, there are many people who downvote posts that they don\u2019t like, which moves those posts down the rankings.

This pigment, which is found in the leaves of plants, is able to absorb the light, which is then used to make food from carbon dioxide and water. \n\nThe black pigment is called melanin, and it is in the stems and roots of plants. \n\nMelanin is a dark pigment that absorbs all the light, and prevents the leaves from making food. \n\nMelanin absorbs more light than chlorophyll, so mel", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because it\u2019s not in your blood stream.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know what a viscous liquid is, but if you\u2019re asking about how viscous a liquid is, that would be how much it resists flowing. The viscosity of a liquid is measured by how much force it takes to move through it.  The viscosity of a liquid is measured in a unit called \u201cpoise\u201d or \u201cpascal seconds.\u201d  It is the same thing as the viscosity of a solid.  A liquid with a very high viscosity will be more like a solid than a liquid.

Sometimes they just have to show the camera.  When they do that, it\u2019s usually because the camera is in a position that would be hard to get to.

Or are you pushing the button to adjust the temperature?  If you\u2019re adjusting the temperature, you\u2019re adjusting the amount of hot water that\u2019s mixed with the cold water.  If you\u2019re turning on the shower, you\u2019re controlling the amount of hot water that comes out of the shower head.

ISIS has been designated a terrorist organization by the United Nations.\n\nIn June 2014, the group captured the Iraqi city of Mosul, and began making demands of", "\n\nHuman: How does having a record label help bands, and how would an indie label differ from a major label?\n\nI've searched this many times but have yet to get a clear answer. anyone have a simple explanation that could be a little more clear?\n\nAssistant: How does having a record label help bands?", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re asking for, but if you\u2019re asking about the physics of pulling train cars, it\u2019s due to the friction between the wheels and the rails, the friction between the wheels and the track, the force of gravity, and the force from the engine. The force from the engine is the biggest factor in pulling a train.", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not entirely sure what you are asking.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Well, I\u2019m not sure I understand your question.  Could you clarify it?", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think you\u2019re referring to the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC.  I\u2019m not sure exactly what they\u2019re trying to accomplish there, but I think it\u2019s to learn more about the universe and the particles that make it up.  The hope is that the LHC will help us discover more about the fundamental nature of the universe, and about how things work.  This is important for humanity because it will allow us to better understand the universe, which we\u2019re all a part of.  Understanding more about how things work will help us make better decisions in our daily lives", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sure!", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a very interesting question! I\u2019ll do my best to explain the answer to you.\n\nFirst of all, we should talk about how time is measured. Scientists measure time using something called a \u201csecond\u201d. A second is the time it takes for a certain type of atom to make a certain amount of vibrations. So, every second, an atom vibrates 100 billion times.\n\nNow, we need to talk about light. Light travels at a certain speed, which is called the speed of light. Light travels at a speed of 300,00", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Do you mean how do we decide that a meter is a certain length?", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know why you think they cause excruciating pain, but I think it\u2019s because your eyes are bigger.  When you\u2019re little, your eyes are smaller, and your eyeballs are farther away from your nose, so things that seem tiny to you, like soap bubbles, can actually hit your eyes.  But as you get older, your eyes get bigger and your eyeballs get closer to your nose, so things that seem tiny to you, like soap bubbles, can\u2019t actually hit your eyes.  But also, as you get older, you", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, let me answer this in a few different ways. First, I\u2019ll give you a brief overview of how we find exoplanets, and then I\u2019ll give you a brief explanation of why the existence of a planet beyond Neptune is still a matter of controversy.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Eating a mate is one way to get rid of the competition.

I\u2019m sorry.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: It depends on the movie.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: I don't know if this is the kind of question you're looking for, but it is a very interesting one!\n\nI'm going to assume you mean remains that are well-preserved, such as those you mention. I don't know if this is the case, but sometimes the bones of very young children don't have enough minerals to be preserved. They may also be less likely to be preserved because they are smaller.\n\nIt's important to remember that the remains of people who are young, middle-aged, and old are all found in the same place.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a lot of reasons for this. The most obvious is that males and females need to be able to reproduce. So there are differences that allow them to do that.  But there are other reasons too.  For example, if you look at the human male and female bodies, you will see that the male has a penis and testicles, and the female has a vagina and ovaries.  In many animals, including humans, the male and female genitals are the same.  For example, a male deer has a penis, and a female deer has a vagina.", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.

How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Well, I\u2019m not sure I understand your question.", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I think you\u2019re talking about how people used to set their alarm clocks. Alarm clocks are actually a relatively recent invention, and they weren\u2019t that common until the 20th century. Before that, people would wake up at a certain time by simply waking up at that time.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: I don't understand the question.  Can you rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: How do you mean?", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Well, they\u2019d have to find them first. If the person was born in the country, they would have a record. But if they were born somewhere else, they would probably not.  If they were in the military, they would have records of who they were, where they came from, and where they went. But if they were just a random person, they wouldn\u2019t have any records.  So it would be difficult to find them, and to know where they were.  But you could have the government do it.  They have a lot of resources, and they would be able to find people that way", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Do you mean the percentage sign (%)?

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: Let me look up a few articles for you.

Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense?

The main answer is that there\u2019s a lot of different countries involved in the world, and not all of them are going to have the same priorities. It\u2019s a question of what they\u2019re willing to do, what they\u2019re able to do, and what their priorities are.", "\n\nHuman: Sure Deposit\n\nI am being told that, despite having deposit in the name, it's just an unrelated fee.

It's true that some people seem to recover from Ebola, and others don't.\n\nThe immune system plays a part in this, and also whether there was a lot of bleeding, and whether the person was severely dehydrated.\n\nBut there are also other things going on. Some people who have Ebola actually get better, and others don't.\n\nThere are also other viruses that are less serious.  Measles, for example, can be deadly if it's not treated,", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think that there are many reasons.

Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a state of dormancy that many animals enter during the winter months, when food is scarce.  Hibernators enter a deep sleep state, and their metabolism slows down to a fraction of its normal rate.  They do not eat, drink, or urinate while they are hibernating.  This helps them survive the winter, and makes it possible for them to recover quickly once food is available again.  Many animals hibernate, including bears, bats, and certain types of snakes.  The hibernation process varies widely among different species, but the general", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s easier to understand a language than to speak it because it is much easier to learn words than it is to learn the grammar.

To help you, I'll give you a few examples:\n\n1) There are many devices that blind people can use to help them find their way.  They can use a guide dog or a cane, which tells them where to walk.  They can also use a guide dog to tell them which way to go.  Or, if there's a sign, they can feel the braille on it and know which way to go.\n\n2) Braille is a code that uses raised dots.

It means you are afraid of something.", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The first step in bringing a Neanderthal back to life would be to figure out what DNA sequences it had that made it unique.  This would involve sequencing the DNA of modern humans, modern humans with some Neanderthal DNA, and modern humans with very little Neanderthal DNA.  Modern humans with a lot of Neanderthal DNA would be useful because they would have the most Neanderthal DNA, but it would be possible to do this with humans who have some Neanderthal DNA, and also with humans who have very little Neanderthal DNA.\n\nOnce this has been", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Transgender is someone who feels their gender identity is different from what is socially expected for their biological sex.

I\u2019m not sure that I can explain it very well, but I\u2019ll try.  Some things seem funnier to us when we\u2019re high because our brains interpret them differently.  For example, when we\u2019re high, it seems like there are a lot more jokes in the world.  There\u2019s a lot more humor in the world.  Our brains are processing things a little differently, and they seem to be more funny.  I think", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The answer to your question is that they have a variety of strategies to remain profitable.  For example, some package stores have large liquor stores attached to them and are therefore more likely to survive the proliferation of liquor stores.  Other package stores may have a lot of customers who only want to purchase beer, which is not as popular as liquor.  Some package stores also have gasoline pumps, which can also be profitable.  In addition, some package stores have a large number of customers who only want to purchase cigarettes, which is another way to remain profitable", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Cooking shrimp causes a chemical reaction that turns the shrimp orange, while cooking meat causes a chemical reaction that turns the meat brown.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: You are asking about a calculator, right?", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \u201cnatural food\u201d?", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: I can answer the first part, but not the second.", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods?

A BBS was a way for people to connect over the internet before the internet existed.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: That's a really interesting question, and I'm not sure I have a good answer for you. I'm a little surprised by your question though. I'm not sure I agree that Iran is \"relatively accepting of transsexuals.\" I've read a little about this topic, and it seems like the situation is very complex and not as simple as you're suggesting.

Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure that depression is a side effect of prescription drugs.  I do know that some medications can cause depression as a side effect, though.  For example, some antidepressants can cause a patient to become depressed, and antipsychotics are known to cause a condition called akathisia, which can cause depression.

Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: Water is often clear, but it also can be cloudy.  You're correct that the sky is reflected in the water, and this is what makes the water blue.  The sky is blue because of the way that the light bounces off the water.  The reason the water isn't clear is that there are lots of small particles suspended in the water.  These particles are known as \"dust\" and they come from the air.

The air that is trapped in clouds is very dense, and so it doesn't move very quickly.  If it did, it would be much harder for the clouds to form.  Also, the wind that blows the clouds is usually moving at a much lower speed than the wind outside the clouds, so it doesn't move the clouds very quickly.  I hope this helps.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer?

The old TV\u2019s power is connected to the signal cable, and when you plug in the cable, you\u2019re also plugging in a lot of voltage from the power supply to the TV\u2019s circuitry.  It\u2019s the same noise you hear when a car battery is low or dead.  It\u2019s the sound of the electricity flowing through the wires.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The batteries run out of power because the chemical energy in the battery is converted to electrical energy.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: Spinning in circles can be a lot of fun, but it can also make you dizzy. When your body is in motion, it\u2019s constantly trying to regulate itself and keep your inner ear from spinning out of control. When you spin in circles, that can make your inner ear unstable and it can make you feel sick.", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you mean, can you explain more?", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know.", "\n\nHuman: The Jerry Springer Show\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not familiar with that show.

These cones are in our eyes, and they are very sensitive to the wavelengths of light that are visible to us.  We have three types of cones that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light.  There\u2019s red cones, green cones, and blue cones.  When the light hits our eyes, the light is converted into electrical signals, and those electrical signals are sent to the brain where they are interpreted as different colours.  These colours are the ones we can", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, that\u2019s a very interesting question.  I think the most basic answer is that they are underdeveloped because they don\u2019t have the capital needed to develop.  I think there are a few reasons for this.  First, I think a lot of them have never had a chance to develop at all.  They\u2019ve been colonized or oppressed by other countries for a long time.  So even if they had the capital, they wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to use it.  Second, I think some of them are poor because they haven\u2019t been able to get the capital", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: Because it\u2019s cheaper to use the internet than to build and maintain a separate network.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini.

There are many different ways terror groups can claim responsibility for an attack. For example, the leader of the group may write a letter to the media. They may do this by sending a letter to a journalist, or by posting a letter to a website. They may also call the media and claim responsibility. Another way a group could claim responsibility is if the leader of the group gives an interview where he or she claims responsibility for the attack.", "\n\nHuman: The Monty Hall Paradox/Problem\n\nI was inspired by reading [this comment](_URL_0_) as well as the explanation given in the movie 21.\n\nThe basics of the problem, taken from the link above:\n\n >  the monty hall paradox, you are given a choice of three doors with a prize behind one, you pick door #3. door #2 is opened, there is nothing behind it. you are given the the choice to switch your choice from door #3 to door #1, doing so increases your chances of winning every single time.\n\nI know this has been posted before, but I can't for the life of me wrap my head around it.

But I can give you some ideas to think about.  Let\u2019s start by looking at what information your computer has available to it, and how that information can be used to track you.\n\nFirst, most computers have a \u201cgraphics card\u201d that lets them show images.

And sometimes there is a natural disaster that can destroy the economy.  For example, a country can have a lot of money, but if there is a natural disaster that destroys their crops, they can lose a lot of money.  Another reason is that sometimes the government makes bad decisions.  For example, if the government decides to build a lot of public buildings, that can create a lot of jobs", "\n\nHuman: Why can we feel hot/sweaty, but when you touch your skin (or someone else does) the skin feels cold?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Do you mean the sensation of heat and cold?  If so, the mechanics of that are complicated.  Your body is continually trying to regulate its internal temperature.  When the temperature drops, your body senses this and tries to warm itself.  The same is true for when your body is too hot.  The sensation of hot and cold are due to the activation of the sweat glands and the production of sweat.  When you are sweating, you feel cool, and the skin of the body feels cold.  This is because the sweat cools the skin and produces a", "\n\nHuman: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I think that most people are not aware that they are doing it, and they ask the question in hopes of a different answer than the one they already know.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with the Digimon franchise, and I think it\u2019s great that the franchise is so diverse and creative, but it\u2019s just not as popular as Pokemon.", "\n\nHuman: Why our stomach muscles tense when we cough?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Your stomach muscles tense when you cough because it\u2019s a natural response to the sensation of coughing.  When you cough, your throat tightens, and the force of the cough causes your diaphragm to contract.  The diaphragm is a large muscle that separates your chest and abdomen, and when it contracts, it causes your chest to rise.  When your chest rises, your stomach muscles contract to prevent your stomach from dropping down into your chest.

If the future has already happened, it means that the future is actually the present.  Since the present is happening right now, it would mean that the future is happening right now, but we can\u2019t see it yet.  It would be like a time-lapse video that shows something happening very quickly, but we can\u2019t see it happen.  We can only see the result of what happened.

If he wanted to deter the man from stealing again, then yes, a 3-year prison sentence is a fair punishment.  If he wanted to punish the man for stealing, then no, it's not fair.  I think the judge's goal was probably to deter him from stealing again, and that's why a 3-year sentence is appropriate.
