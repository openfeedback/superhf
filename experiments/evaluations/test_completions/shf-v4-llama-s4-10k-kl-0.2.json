For example, if you have a thermostat set at a certain temperature, and the system is already at that temperature, it will take longer to change the temperature than if the system is already cold or hot.\n\nHysteresis is a common property of systems with memory. Systems with memory are called nonlinear systems.

Your gallbladder stores bile, which helps your body break down fats. Your liver makes bile and stores it in your gallbladder, where it is concentrated and ready to be used.
