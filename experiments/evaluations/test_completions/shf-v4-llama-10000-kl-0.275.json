As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: The main reason is that eggs have a higher concentration of protein than pasta. Protein is a polymer made up of amino acids. When protein is heated, it starts to break down into amino acids. These amino acids are then joined together to form new proteins, which are then absorbed into the body. In eggs, the proteins are tightly packed together. When they are heated, they do not break down as much, so they do not absorb into the body and they remain as a solid. In pasta, the proteins are not packed together as tight", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hello, you are calling the United Nations.

It is called supersymmetry because it transforms super-symmetric objects, and bosons and fermions are the most basic super-symmetric objects.

It is a symmetry that is broken, and it is broken in a way that is very important for the Standard Model.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: It is because the palms of our hands have less sweat glands than other parts of our body.", "\n\nHuman: What is actually happening when your heart \"aches\"?\n\nAssistant: Your heart is actually just sending a signal to your brain that you are sad.", "\n\nHuman: Can anybody explain me what science says about \"Ghost\"?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hello, thank you for calling the Assistance Center.", "\n\nHuman: Why are peanuts so much more affordable than other nuts?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because peanuts are grown in the United States.", "\n\nHuman: How do compression shorts and compression tights help athletes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Compression shorts and compression tights help athletes by increasing blood flow and oxygen to muscles, which can help prevent muscle damage and help with recovery time.", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens when you pull your back?

And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: I believe that it is because of the rotation of the earth. Since the earth rotates, it gives us the sunlight and warmth during the day, which makes it possible for us to function. And since it rotates, it also gives us the moonlight, which is required to give us light at night, which is when we sleep. We need the moonlight to see in the dark, and we also need it to make it possible for us to sleep, which is why we have to sleep during the night.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time?

How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: It is not possible for you to taste anything when medication is pushed through an IV.  You are tasting the medication.  The medication could be in the form of a pill, liquid, or injection.  When it is administered through an IV, the medication is pushed into the vein, which is part of the bloodstream.  The medication enters your bloodstream and is then distributed throughout your body.  When a pill or liquid is taken by mouth, it is absorbed by the stomach and then enters the bloodstream.  It takes longer for a pill or liquid", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The answer is that time is relative. The rate of time passage is different in different locations. As you move away from the Earth, the time passes slower. This is not because the Earth is moving, but because time is passing slower at that location.\n\nThis is similar to a train moving away from you. When you are standing next to the train, time is passing slower than when you are standing far away from the train. The reason is that the train is moving faster than you are. But this does not mean that the train is moving faster than you. It just means that time is passing slower for you than", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \u201cmeter\u201d?", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is because when you are little, your eyes are more sensitive.

I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: The Japanese people tend to be a bit more conservative when it comes to sexuality.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Bringing a Neanderthal back into existence is possible, but it would be extremely difficult to do, and would likely take many years. There is a lot of genetic diversity among Neanderthals, and it is unclear which specific traits would be needed to make a Neanderthal viable. Additionally, a Neanderthal would need to be able to reproduce successfully. Bringing back a Neanderthal would likely require a lot of genetic engineering, and there are a lot of ethical issues that would need to be addressed.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hello, how can I help you?", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hello, thank you for calling the Drug Information Center.", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hello, thank you for calling.
