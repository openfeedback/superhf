As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: Eggs contain a protein called albumin, which is a water-soluble protein. When boiled, the water is removed from the egg, and the albumin proteins start to stick together. The albumin proteins form a network of interlocking strands, which give the egg its shape. When the egg is cooled down, the network of proteins starts to contract, and this is what causes the egg to harden. When the egg is boiled, the proteins are denatured, which means that they lose their ability to bind together. The egg thus becomes softer, and", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't quite get that.", "\n\nHuman: The Watergate scandal and why it happened\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hello,", "\n\nHuman: You don't sail, pilot, or drive a kayak, surely.

Vitamin D3 is synthesized in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol by exposure to UV radiation.

Hysteresis is a property of a system in which a small change in the input results in a large change in the output.  The change in output is a result of a lag in the system response.  This lag can be attributed to the time taken for a system to reach equilibrium after a change in the input.  Hysteresis is a common property of many systems.  A simple example is a bouncing ball.  The ball bounces upward when it is dropped.  As the ball bounces up, it comes closer to equilibrium, or the", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

It is because the larger the animal, the slower it grows and the slower it matures. This means the larger the animal, the more time it has to live. For example, a whale has a very long lifespan because it takes a long time for it to mature.

The theory is based on the observation that the universe is expanding and that its expansion is accelerating. It proposes that the universe was once much smaller, denser, and hotter and that it expanded from a primordial hot dense state.
