Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Dry things tend to have a higher surface area to volume ratio than wet things.  Dry things are also more compact and have a lower density than wet things.  When a dry thing gets wet, it loses its density and becomes less compact.  Since the surface area is now larger than it was before, the surface area to volume ratio increases.  The surface area to volume ratio is what determines how much of a substance is exposed to the air.  This means that the wet thing will be able to exchange gases with the air more easily than the dry thing.  Since it is easier for gases", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The answer to your question is a little complicated, but I will try to explain it.\n\nIn the universe, time is relative. This means that the passage of time is different for different people. For example, an astronaut who travels into space will experience time more slowly than someone who remains on the Earth. This is because time is measured by how much something happens, and when you are in space, things happen less often.\n\nOn Earth, time is measured in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years.

But, some of the remains are from children, while others are from adults.  The Ice Man is an adult.  It's possible that the remains of children were more likely to be preserved than those of adults.  This may be due to the fact that children's bones are still growing.  As a result, they may be more easily preserved.  Also, children may have been buried in a different manner than adults.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: The reason for this is because each coin flip is independent of the previous coin flips.  Each coin flip is a random event, and the probability that it will land on heads or tails is 50/50.  No matter how many coin flips have occurred in the past, the next coin flip will be independent of the previous coin flips and will have a probability of 50/50.\n\nThe probability of heads or tails is the same for each coin flip.

I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: The firework was a shell, which contained a large amount of gunpowder and a small explosive charge. The shell was set off with a fuse that was lit at the bottom, which ignited the gunpowder. The gunpowder is highly explosive, and is also highly flammable. It burns at a very high temperature, which is why it is used in fireworks. The heat from the burning gunpowder is enough to instantly vaporize a person's skin and flesh, which is why it instantly killed the guy.", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: The air is cooler in winter, so it can hold less moisture. The air molecules are closer together, and therefore bump into each other more often. This makes sound waves move faster and louder.\n\nIce is made up of molecules that are tightly packed together. Water is made up of molecules that are loosely packed together. When the water molecules are moving, they are bumping into each other, and this makes sound waves move slower.

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Singing is a very different skill from speaking. When you speak, you're using your voice to project sound, but when you sing, you're using your voice to make music. Singing is a form of musical expression. It's a performance, and it's a performance that's intended to be heard by other people. The reason people's voices sound different when they sing is that they are using their vocal cords to produce different sounds.\n\nWhen you're speaking, your vocal cords are vibrating, but they're vibrating at a lower frequency than they do when", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The water vapour in clouds is in a liquid state, and the air around the cloud is in a gaseous state. This means that the water vapour in the cloud is less dense than the air around it. This creates a pressure difference between the two, which pushes the cloud upward. The water vapour in the cloud is less dense because it has a lower temperature than the air around it. This is because the water vapour is cooling down as it rises, and it cools faster than the air around it.\n\nThe water vapour in the cloud is less dense", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: The life span of animals is largely determined by their metabolism. Metabolism is a measure of the number of chemical reactions that occur in a living organism per unit of time. Metabolic rate is directly related to the mass of an animal, since the more mass an animal has, the more chemical reactions it can perform. Therefore, larger animals have a higher metabolic rate than smaller animals. Large animals also have a larger body surface area, which increases the rate of heat loss from the animal. This means that larger animals have a lower body temperature than smaller animals, and this can also shorten the", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, what?", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: A significant digit is a digit that is used to indicate a number's precision. In other words, a significant digit is a digit that is used to represent a number that is accurate to a certain number of decimal places.\n\nFor example, 22.3 + 3.45 = 25.75. 22.3 is 22 to 3 decimal places, and 3.45 is 3.45 to 5 decimal places. 25.75 is 25.75 to 2 decimal places. 25.75 is", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver is the main organ that stores bile. Bile is a substance that is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. The liver produces bile when it needs to be stored. The bile breaks down fat and helps to digest food. When bile is stored in the gallbladder it is stored in a concentrated form, so when the liver needs to make bile, it can be made more quickly. When the gallbladder is removed, the liver still makes bile, but it is not concentrated and must be broken down into a", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV is called \"snow\".", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries are rechargeable, but they can only hold a limited amount of charge before they need to be recharged. The amount of charge they can hold is called their capacity. A battery's capacity is measured in milliamp-hours (mAh). The more mAh a battery has, the longer it will last.\n\nThe reason batteries run out of power is because they don't have an unlimited supply of electrons. When a battery is first charged, the positive and negative terminals of the battery are full of electrons. As the battery discharges, electrons are used up.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Water is a polar molecule. Salt is a nonpolar molecule. This means that the electrons are not evenly distributed in water. When you add salt, the electrons on the water molecule are attracted to the negative charges on the salt. This causes the water molecules to separate from each other. This makes the water molecules move around more and can cause the water to evaporate.\n\nThe reason why this happens is that water is a polar molecule. Salt is a nonpolar molecule. This means that the electrons are not evenly distributed in water. When you", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Wrinkly hands are a common occurrence when you wash your hands in water for a long time. This happens because the skin on your hands is dry and it loses its moisture when it is in water for a long time. The skin becomes wrinkly because it loses its flexibility and becomes rigid. When the skin is in contact with water, it absorbs the water and swells. This causes the skin to become wrinkly because it loses its flexibility. Wrinkly hands can be caused by a condition called as eczema.
