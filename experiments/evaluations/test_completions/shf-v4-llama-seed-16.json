So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: The sugar is bad because it is calorie dense.  Sugar has 4 calories per gram.  This means that if you eat 100g of sugar you will be consuming 400 calories.  If you eat 100g of bread you will only be consuming 300 calories.  Sugar is bad because it is calorie dense.", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Well, the first thing you have to do is find a human to act as a surrogate mother.  This is a challenging step, because you need to find a woman who is willing to act as a surrogate, and you need to find a woman who is a good genetic match for the Neanderthal.  This is where the Neanderthal genome comes into play.  You have to find a woman who has a genetic match for the Neanderthal genome, and then you have to find a woman who is willing to act as a surrogate.

What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are a way of expressing a number in a way that is more precise than just giving a number. 22.3 + 3.45 would be 25.75 because that is the exact sum of those two numbers. 22.3 + 3.45 is not a significant digit, it is just an approximation of the sum of those two numbers.", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Your bile is stored in your liver and is released into your small intestine. The bile is stored in the liver because it is a very concentrated solution. It contains bile acids, cholesterol, and bilirubin. Bile acids are made in the liver and are used to break down fat and fat-soluble vitamins. Bile is released from the liver into the small intestine when the gallbladder releases bile.
