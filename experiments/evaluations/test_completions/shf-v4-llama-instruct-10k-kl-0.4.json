How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later?

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: They are from children because children tend to be smaller, and therefore, easier to preserve than adults. This is because children have less bone mass than adults and their bones are more fragile. In addition, children tend to have less muscle mass than adults, and as a result, they are less likely to be buried in a position that would result in their muscles being preserved. This is especially true for children who are found in water, because their bodies are less likely to float than adults. Also, children are more likely to be found in caves, because they are more likely to be playing in", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Male lions have large canine teeth and a mane, while female lions have small teeth and no mane.

The droplets and crystals are very small and are shaped like tiny ice cubes.\n\nThey are able to maintain their shape because they are supported by a strong force called cohesion. This force is caused by the attraction between the tiny droplets and crystals.\n\nThe droplets and crystals are so small that they are able to be supported by the tiny amount of cohesion. This is the same force that holds water molecules together in a pud", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: Larger animals generally have longer lifespans due to their size and nutritional needs. They require more food to sustain their bodies and provide energy to keep them functioning. This can lead to the development of diseases due to a lack of vitamins and nutrients in their diets. Smaller animals have a shorter lifespan because they don't require as much food to survive. Their bodies are smaller so they require less energy to function and they don't have the same nutritional requirements as larger animals. They also require less energy to hunt for food and find shelter.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are used to determine how accurate a number is. For example, if you were to add 22.3 and 3.45, you would get 25.75. However, you would not just leave it like that. You would need to round it off to get the exact answer. If you rounded it off to the nearest hundredth, you would get 25.8. If you rounded it off to the nearest tenth, you would get 25.8. If you rounded it off to the nearest fifth, you would get 25.8.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver stores bile in the gallbladder. The gallbladder stores bile and releases it into the ducts when the body needs to break down fats. The bile contains digestive enzymes that help break down fats in your food.\n\nThe liver also produces bile. It breaks down fats in the body and releases them into the small intestine. The small intestine absorbs the fat into your body. Bile also helps break down fat-soluble vitamins.\n\nYour saliva and pancreas do not help break", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: A high pitch ringing noise is called a tone and it is caused by the television's tuner.

The power is provided by the Ethernet cable, and can be used to power devices such as IP cameras, wireless access points, IP phones, and other network devices.\n\nPoE allows the connection of network devices to the network using a standard Ethernet cable, without the need for a separate power cable. This is possible because the power and data are transmitted over a single cable, which can reduce installation costs and make it easier to move or reconfigure a", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Colours are produced by light that is reflected by objects, and our eyes detect the reflected light and interpret it as colours.  The colour of an object depends on the wavelength of light that is reflected by the object.  When light from a source strikes an object, some of it is absorbed by the object, and some is reflected.  The amount of light that is reflected is related to the wavelength of the light, and the amount of light that is absorbed is related to the wavelength of the light.  The absorbed light is converted into heat, and the reflected light is the colour", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Third world countries are underdeveloped because of a combination of factors. These factors include a lack of resources, poor infrastructure, and a lack of capital. Lack of resources includes a lack of natural resources, such as minerals, and a lack of human capital. Lack of infrastructure includes a lack of roads, a lack of electricity, and a lack of water. Lack of capital includes a lack of funding, a lack of access to capital, and a lack of credit.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Water is a molecule that is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. It is the molecule that makes up 60% of the human body and 70% of the planet. Water is a very important molecule to the human body, as it is essential for survival. Water is also a very important molecule in the planet, as it is the main component of the atmosphere. Water is also very important to the planet because it helps to regulate the temperature and to create weather. Water is also very important to the planet because it helps to maintain the ecosystem", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water molecules are polar, which means they are attracted to the negatively charged electrons in the molecules of other things. This is why water is attracted to other things, like dirt and oil. It is also why water is attracted to skin. \n\nWater molecules are attracted to the positively charged ions in skin cells. When these molecules attach to the skin, they form a layer of water between the skin and the outside world. This layer of water is called the skin's hydration layer.\n\nThe hydration layer is made up of water and the skin", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: A telescope collects light and focuses it onto a detector. It cannot see objects that are not emitting light. The Moon does not emit light, so it is invisible to telescopes.\n\nAstronomers have been observing the Moon for thousands of years, and have learned a lot about it. They can see the Moon's surface, but not the equipment left on the Moon by the Apollo astronauts. The Apollo equipment was not designed to be seen, and is not emitting light. It is invisible to telescopes.\n\nAstronomers can only see the Moon when", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Drinking a liquid can actually dehydrate you if the liquid contains caffeine, alcohol, or sugar. Caffeine and sugar are both diuretics, meaning they cause you to urinate more frequently and in greater amounts, which means you are losing more water than you are drinking. Alcohol is a depressant, meaning it causes your body to slow down, which can also cause you to urinate less frequently and in smaller amounts. A combination of these three can cause you to become dehydrated.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hispanic and Latino are two terms that are often used interchangeably but have different meanings.
