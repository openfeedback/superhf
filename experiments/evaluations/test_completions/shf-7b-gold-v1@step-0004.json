Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. This is because the more precisely you measure the position of a particle, the less precisely you can measure its momentum, and vice versa. This is because the act of measuring one value changes the other. This is due to the fact that the act of measuring a particle's position requires it to be in contact with something, which means it has a momentum, and likewise, measuring a particle's momentum requires it to be in contact with something, which means it has", "\n\nHuman: Why do humans have allergic reactions?\n\nWhy, biologically, would certain people react in a certain ways to certain allergens, especially if it is an almost fatal reaction?\n\nAssistant: Well, allergic reactions are the body's way of responding to a foreign substance that it perceives as a threat. The body produces antibodies to fight off the allergen, and in some cases, these antibodies can cause an overreaction, leading to an allergic reaction. This is why some people are more prone to allergies than others - their immune system is more likely to react strongly to certain allergens.", "\n\nHuman: What is the best way to learn a new language?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The best way to learn a new language is to immerse yourself in it. This could include listening to the language, reading books and other materials, watching movies or TV shows in the target language, and speaking with native speakers.

Even if a person didn\u2019t go by their first name, they went by a nickname or abbreviated version of their first name. \n\nIs it to distinguish people, especially as we now live in larger cities?\n\nLike there might be more than one Jose Ramirez in a city, but only one Jose Hector Ramirez? Or is there a cultural significance to them? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem very practical, in your day to day life.\n\nAssistant: Well, in some cultures, it is seen as a way of honoring a family member or paying tribute to a patron saint. In other cultures, it can be a way of distinguishing one person from another with the same name. In some cases, it can also be a way of connecting someone to their ancestry or background.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between eczema and psoriasis?", "\n\nHuman: How can human smugglers illegally ship migrants to a different country?

For instance, the repeating decimal 1.111111... is infinite, but you'll never find a 5 in there along the way. However, infinitely repeating numbers and an infinite universe (or infinite number of universes) seem like an entirely different concept.\n\nAssistant: It's impossible to say for sure. If the universe is infinite, then it's possible that every possible scenario has already occurred or will occur in some alternate reality. However, the probability of any one scenario occurring is so small that it's impossible to calculate.", "\n\nHuman: What is the Fast Fourier Transform? (Or FFT) and how does one go on implementing it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's a mathematical algorithm used to convert a signal or an image from the time-domain to the frequency domain, or vice versa. It works by breaking down the signal into its component frequencies, and then calculating the magnitude of each frequency component. The magnitude of each frequency component is then plotted in a graph, which can be used to visualize the frequency content of the signal.\n\n\nTo implement the FFT, first the signal is broken down into sections or blocks of data. Then the blocks are transformed into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform equations. The magnitude of each frequency component is then calculated and", "\n\nHuman: Audio Data Compression\n\nI'm working on a project where we have to compress an audio file (so we can have it be loseless) and we have to judge SQNR as well as sound quality compared to original (qualitative). \n\nI'm not sure how any of this works (my professor doesn't seem that good at explaining things).

I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: I think you should check out the US Treasury Bills. They are considered one of the safest investments around.", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't casting agents celebrated at awards ceremonies like the Emmys and the Oscars?\n\nI think pretty much everyone on the planet agrees that whoever chose the actors for the *Harry Potter* movies did the absolute best job humanly possible. Likewise, *Game of Thrones* is a masterpiece of a television show in part because the actors so perfectly fit the roles they have been assigned to play.\n\nWhy aren't the people who make these decisions, which are so important to the success or failure of a movie or show, given major awards like the Emmys or the Oscars? I, for one, certainly think they deserve the recognition.\n\nAssistant: What do you think about the lack of recognition for casting directors?", "\n\nHuman: How I'm productive at the library as opposed to being lazy and drowsy at home?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That's a great question.

They can also be a symptom of a cold or allergy.", "\n\nHuman: Americans and Credit Card Debt\n\nAs an European I don't really understand why so many Americans have such high credit card debt. What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: What is the typical American attitude towards debt?", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: Because aluminum oxidation is a different process than that of steel, which is known as rusting. Rusting is a chemical process that involves the reaction of oxygen and iron to form iron oxides, while aluminum oxidation is a physical process that involves the oxidation of aluminum atoms to form aluminum oxide.  Additionally, rusting is a electrochemical process, while aluminum oxidation is a thermal process.", "\n\nHuman: Why is is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure why that is. It could be due to the bright light making it more difficult to hold your breath or it could be because the light is reflecting off your eyes and causing them to water.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is a memory, on an atomic level?\n\nIn order to retrieve a memory, the neurons have to access it somehow. I wonder how the memory of what you had for breakfast is different on am atomic level than the memory of your first kiss.\n\nAssistant: Well, memories are encoded in the connections between neurons. When an experience is remembered, the neurons that were activated during the experience are reactivated and communicate with each other. This creates a lasting connection between the neurons, which is what we remember. The memory of what you had for breakfast is encoded in the same way as the memory of your first kiss, on an atomic level. The difference is that the first memory is likely more emotionally charged, which is why it is easier to recall.", "\n\nHuman: How does an ice cream machine dispense ice cream?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It uses a churning mechanism to mix ice cream ingred", "\n\nHuman: Why do babies cry as soon as they\u2019re born, and why is it a bad sign if they don\u2019t?\n\nThe answer seems like it should be obvious, but is there something else going on that makes this such an important component of its well being?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \u201cbad sign\u201d?", "\n\nHuman: Is the US Police really becoming an arbitrary tool or is it just the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts?\n\nGerman student here. I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\". I have been to Boston before and didn't see wrong policepower. Therefore I'm asking myself where these videos are coming from and if they are true. This is not meant to be a revolutionist-topic.

Additionally, different cars have different speeds and handling capabilities, so some cars will be able to go faster than others and some will be able to take turns more sharply.  Therefore, the race is not always won or lost at the starting line.", "\n\nHuman: Sensitive Skin - Why does it seem like people with pale skin are more prone to acne?\n\nWhy do gingers seem to get more zits than say swarthy italian people?  \n\nAssistant: Well, it could be due to the fact that people with fairer skin tend to have thinner skin and are more prone to inflammation and irritation. The more sensitive their skin is, the more likely it is that they will get acne. Additionally, certain ingredients in skin care products and makeup can cause irritation and sensitivity, which can lead to breakouts.  So, it's possible that people with fair skin are more likely to experience acne due to their sensitive skin.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the current temperature in Celsius?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we groan and make deep noises when lifting weights and in pain?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because it is a physiological response to the stress of exerting force.", "\n\nHuman: We eat food, drink water and breathe down our throats. Why do we gag when we put our finger in our throat?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We gag when we put our finger in our throat because it is an involuntary reflex that occurs when something is blocking the airway. This reflex helps to prevent us from inhaling food or drink into our lungs.", "\n\nHuman: What is happening when our nipples get hard?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The nipples become hard when they are stimulated by cold, heat, pressure, or friction. It is also a response to certain hormones and emotions.", "\n\nHuman: Why haven't we been able to find out where Blue Whales mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We don't know for sure, but some scientists believe that Blue Whales mate in the winter in the shallow, sheltered waters of the southern oceans.", "\n\nHuman: What is the point of Kirchhoff's First Law?\n\nMy exam starts in 3 hours so this is late but what the hell.\n\nIf Kirchhoff's first law says the current going into a junction is equal to the current coming out of a junction isn't that basically saying that I=I? I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: The point of Kirchhoff's First Law is to provide a general rule for the behavior of currents in a circuit.

It is composed of four main parts: the femur, tibia, patella, and kneecap. The knee joint has two types of ligaments that help stabilize the knee and keep it from hyperextending or hyperflexing.

Wouldn\u2019t video be more valuable for the NTSB in case something bad happens?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because audio recording is easier and less expensive than video recording. Video recording requires more equipment and more complex technology, and the NTSB would have to review hours of footage in order to get useful information from it.

Tried googling it and all I found was how Hyper-threading allows 2 threads to run on a single core, without explaining what threads are, and why running more is better\n\nEDIT: Thanks for answering guys!\n\nAdditional question: Is hyper-threading better or worse for gaming.

I'm not sure I know the answer to that.  It could be that the sound is no longer associated with the meaning of the word due to repetition.  It could also be that the sound is becoming more abstract with each use, and no longer has a concrete meaning.", "\n\nHuman: What happens when you \"break the seal\" while you have been drinking?\n\nBasically, why does this cause you to go pee every 20 minutes after you go pee the first time?

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: What operating system are you using?

I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: What kind of sound?", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure why that would happen.

Can't they just stop choking themselves when it gets sketchy? And once they pass out, doesn't the body automatically breathe for them/if applicable their partner would stop choking them?\n\nAssistant: Well, it depends on the circumstances. If someone is asphyxiating themselves, they may not be able to regulate how long they are doing it for, or they may not be aware of how long they have been doing it for.
