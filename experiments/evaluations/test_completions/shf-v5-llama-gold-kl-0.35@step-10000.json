Surfactants can lower the surface tension of liquids because they have both polar and non-polar groups on them.  Polar groups have a positive charge and a negative charge, so they are attracted to each other. Non-polar groups are not charged, so they are not attracted to each other. The polar groups on the shampoo molecules attract the non-polar groups on the", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it?

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Smell is a chemical sense.

Viruses are small infectious agents that are unable to replicate on their own. Viruses require a host cell to replicate. When a virus infects a host cell, it takes over the host cell and forces it to produce new viruses. The new viruses then leave the host cell and infect other cells. This process is called the replication cycle of a virus.\n\nViruses can be divided into two broad categories based on their life cycle. \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{Lytic vir", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: To what end?", "\n\nHuman: Why do pupils dilate on drugs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Dilation of pupils is a sign of the action of a drug on the brain.

It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: This is a good question. This may be a cultural thing. For example, in western societies, it is more common for adults to be the main characters. Western cultures tend to focus more on adults and their problems. In eastern societies, the focus is on children, and the problems they face. This could be because of the way children are treated in eastern cultures. They are often given more responsibilities and are often looked upon as the leaders of the family. In western societies, children are often protected and looked after by their parents. They are often not given the same responsibilities as adult", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Correct, hibernation is a state of deep sleep, and hibernating animals do not move at all during this time. It is not a state of rest, as animals continue to breathe, pump blood, and regulate body temperature while hibernating. Animals are able to do this because they have a high capacity for fat storage, and the extra fat they eat during the fall is converted to energy for the winter. They also lower their body temperature to conserve energy.", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's easier to understand a language than to speak it because speaking a language involves more than just understanding the words.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Yes, it has been discussed.  A human genome is much smaller than a Neanderthal genome.  It is estimated that a Neanderthal genome is about 3.2 gigabytes in size, whereas a human genome is only about 3.2 gigabytes in size.  In order to bring a Neanderthal genome into existence, a human genome would have to be modified to include the Neanderthal genome, and the human would have to be cloned.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: When you cut a vegetable, you damage some of the cells and create small holes. The cell walls are made of a strong material called cellulose. Cellulose is a polymer made up of several smaller molecules called glucose. The glucose molecules form chains that are bonded together by strong chemical bonds. When you cut the cell wall, some of these chemical bonds are broken. The broken bonds can no longer hold the glucose chains together. The glucose molecules are now free to move around. They move into the holes you created in the cell wall.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water is a polar solvent, so the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules are weak, and the water molecules are able to move freely. This allows the water molecules to move in and out of the skin, which makes the skin feel soft. When we take a bath or shower, the water molecules in the skin are able to move freely, and they are able to move in and out of the skin, which makes the skin feel soft. When we hold our hands under water for a long time, the water molecules in the skin are unable to move freely, and they cannot move in and out", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because the astronauts were standing in the way.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sodas and coffee dehydrate you by pulling water out of the cells of your body.
