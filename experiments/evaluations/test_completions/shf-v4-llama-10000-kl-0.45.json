When eggs are boiled, the albumin undergoes a change in shape, which causes the egg white to thicken, resulting in the egg yolk to be pressed against the shell. The egg yolk is also composed of proteins, but they are different. The egg white proteins are called alpha-albumins and the egg yolk proteins are called beta-albumins. Both alpha and beta-albumins are soluble in water, but when they are heated, they undergo a change in shape,", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I can't understand what you are saying.

A major label can spend a lot of money to make a record, and they can spend a lot of money to promote it. They have a big budget and they can do a lot of things to promote a band. Indie labels don't have that kind of budget. They can spend some money on a record, but they can't spend a lot of money.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but I'm willing to speculate. Wetness is a pretty good conductor of molecules. When things are wet, their molecules move around a lot, and they can bump into each other and stick together. That's why wet surfaces are so slippery. So I would guess that when things are wet, their molecules are moving around more, and they're more likely to collide with other molecules, and stick to them. And when molecules stick to each other, they're more likely to stay together, which means they're more likely to", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: A stopwatch would not be a reliable measure of time. The passage of time is subjective and is affected by a variety of factors. It is possible that you could travel to another part of the galaxy and return to Earth after a year and find that a decade has passed. It is also possible that you could travel to another part of the galaxy and return to Earth after a decade and find that a year has passed.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: I'm not an archaeologist or anthropologist, but I think there are several factors that lead to this. First of all, children are smaller, and thus take up less space in the grave. Also, the bones of children are softer, so they decompose more easily, and thus are less likely to be preserved. Children also tend to be buried in the same place as their parents, so they are more likely to be found. Children also had less of an economic value than adults, so it would be less likely for them to be buried with a lot of valuable goods.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because of the difference in the sexual organs, the difference in the shape of the body, the difference in the structure of the bone and the difference in the muscle mass.", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: The theoretical limit is 10^15 bits per second.  This is known as the Shannon capacity.  Bandwidth is the amount of information that can be transmitted per second.  It is measured in bits per second.  A cable modem can transmit about 20 megabits per second.  A typical broadband internet connection is 1.5 megabits per second.  A typical home network is 50 megabits per second.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future?

The Neanderthal genome is around 99% identical to the human genome, and the rest of the difference is in the non-coding parts of the genome.  So, it should be possible to use CRISPR/Cas9 or other methods to edit the human genome to match the Neanderthal genome.

This set is called the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The set is infinite, because if it was finite, then it would contain itself, and it would not be a set that does not contain itself.\n\nThe set of all sets that do not contain themselves is a set, so it does not contain itself, and it is not a set that does not contain itself.
