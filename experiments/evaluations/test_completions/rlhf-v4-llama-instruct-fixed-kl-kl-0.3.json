All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: I think I can answer this for you.\n\nLet me start by saying that, yes, it is bad to not chew your food properly.\n\nThe main reason for this is that your stomach is not designed to handle the nutrients you are putting into it. When you are not chewing food properly, you are not breaking the food down into small enough pieces to enter your stomach. This allows the food to pass through your stomach and into the small intestine, where it is supposed to be broken down. When this does not happen, it can cause problems.

This means that the cone cells receive more light than the rod cells do. The cone cells are more sensitive to light, but they also have a narrower range of sensitivity. When the light intensity is too high, the cones are damaged, which causes the pupil to become wider, and the lens to become more convex, so that the light rays are focused on the retina. This is what causes the blurry vision.", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is made from carbon dioxide gas.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: It depends on where you are in the galaxy.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: This is a very interesting question. And the answer has a lot to do with the fact that children are more likely to be buried in the same location as their parents and/or relatives. In some cultures, children would be buried in a family cemetery, or near the house they grew up in. Children are also more likely to be buried in a grave that's already been dug out, since they are small and can be easily moved. The burial sites of adults are often marked with large stones or a small mound of earth. Children are more likely to be buried in a grave that's already been", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The differences between males and females in a species are called sex differences.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: I am not a mathematician, so I can't say I understand your question completely, but I will try to explain my thoughts.\n\nI think that after a series of consecutive heads, the probability of the next flip being heads should be higher, because the probability of the last flip being heads increases the probability of the next one being heads.\n\nIt is similar to a coin flip where the probability of heads is 50% for one flip, and the probability of the next flip being heads increases the probability of the coin landing on heads by 50% (again, after", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It had to be the way the NES light gun worked because it was the only way that light gun games could work.

It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure if i can answer your question in a way that's satisfactory, but let me try.\n\nFor one thing, it's just easier to make an anime about a child. They're easier to draw, and they are more relatable to the audience, and they make for a more engaging story.\n\nAlso, the audience in Japan is a lot older than the audience in the West, and anime and manga are targeted towards a more mature audience. So they have to target more adults, and that's easier to do with a story that revol", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter?

Shrimp contains a protein called myoglobin, which when heated, turns orange. This is the same protein that gives blood its red color. When meat is cooked, the myoglobin breaks down and turns brown. This is due to the Maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between sugars and amino acids. The result is a brown color. The Maillard reaction is also responsible for the color of bread and toast.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: It's a programming language, so it's a bit tricky to answer that.

It's not that Americans are more polarized than other people, it's that the world is more polarized. There are many reasons why this might be happening, but I think the main one is the internet. When you have the internet, you can communicate with people all over the world, and you can learn about different cultures and politics. The internet is a polarizing influence, because it allows you to hear opinions that you may not have heard before, and it makes it easier to talk to people with different", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods?

If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: The purpose of those signs is to let drivers know the height of the bridge to avoid hitting the underside of the bridge. The signs are displayed well in advance of the bridge so that drivers can slow down and pass under the bridge safely.", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly.

This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: Trains are louder because of the friction between the wheels and rails. As the temperature decreases, the rails become more brittle, which leads to more noise and more wear on the wheels and rails.", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: Well, I don't know for sure why this is, but I'll try to explain what I think is going on.\n\nI think that the main reason is that higher education tends to be associated with higher socioeconomic status.\n\nPeople who have higher socioeconomic status tend to be liberal, democrat, or left-wing.\n\nBecause of this, people who have higher socioeconomic status are more likely to go to college and get a degree.\n\nPeople who get degrees in college are more likely to be liberal, democrat, or left", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver has a huge role in digestion, but it does not store bile in itself. It produces bile and secretes it into the duodenum via the common bile duct.\n\nIn order to store bile, it has to be made in the liver. Bile is a yellow to greenish brown liquid produced by the liver. It contains bile pigments, bile salts, and cholesterol, and it helps break down fatty substances in the small intestine.\n\nThe liver also makes glucose from amino acids,", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: It's the electromagnetic relay in the TV which turns on the power supply to the TV.

In fact, the government may not be able to afford to build it. Instead, the government may be able to purchase a service that provides a network.\n\nThe Internet is a decentralized network, meaning that it is not owned by anyone. As a result, it is not safe.

Personally I'm interested in instead of full nation vs full nation how to subpopulations compare to each other? i.e. poor Americans vs poor Chinese, rich americans vs rich Chinese. Anyone familiar with this area?\n\nAssistant: I can tell you the U.S. has a much higher dropout rate than the average OECD country. We also have a lot of public schools with a bad reputation (think inner city public schools).

Ford has been accused of drinking and doing drugs, including crack cocaine. He has also been accused of threatening to kill an editor of the Toronto newspaper the Toronto Star. \n\nFord has admitted that he did use crack cocaine. He has also admitted to drinking and driving, as well as having used marijuana. He has denied ever doing crack cocaine in the mayor's office.\n\nFord has not resigned. The reason is that he remains popular with the voters.
