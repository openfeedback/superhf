When the cells move, the chemicals inside them are mixed up. As they are mixed up, the chemicals start to react with each other and produce a chemical called adenosine triphosphate. Adenosine triphosphate is a kind of energy that is needed to make things work.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: Intel CPUs have higher clock speeds.  Intel also includes a lot of other features that are not in AMD CPUs.  For example, Intel CPUs have a cache that is larger and faster than what AMD CPUs have.  Also, Intel CPUs have a lot of features that are not in AMD CPUs.  Intel CPUs have a lot of extra power to do things like encode and decode video, for example.  This is one of the reasons why Intel CPUs have higher clock speeds.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because there are many nerves in our face and they are sensitive.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is an energy source that your body uses to power its actions.  When you eat sugar, your body breaks it down and uses it for energy.  If you eat more sugar than you need, your body stores the excess as fat.  When you exercise, you burn the stored fat.", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

Indie labels are typically smaller, more flexible, and more accessible.\n\nThe major labels are large companies, with the ability to market and distribute a band's music in a variety of ways. Often, they are the first place a band goes to when they are looking for a record deal.

In the case of the Egyptian hieroglyphics, for example, the hieroglyphics have been divided into a number of groups, and each group is examined separately.

How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: EL15:  Well, the question is, is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through a cable internet connection?\n\nIt is an interesting question because there are limits on the amount of information that can be sent through a telephone connection.  The limit is called the bandwidth.  The bandwidth is the rate at which information can be sent.  The reason the bandwidth is limited is because the connection is a two way street.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: The views of transsexualism in Iran have been shaped by the cultural practices of Shia Islam. The Shia Islamic view of gender roles is a fairly liberal view, which is probably why Iran is relatively accepting of transsexualism.\n\nThe 1979 Iranian Revolution was a fundamentalist revolution, and the Islamic Republic that resulted was a theocracy.
