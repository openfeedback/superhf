The trajectory solution would then be calculated and the rocket would be guided accordingly.", "\n\nHuman: Why are some sounds more piercing than others?\n\nWhy is, say, a high-C played on a flute heard better than a closing door?\n\nAssistant: Because the flute creates a higher frequency sound wave than a closing door.  The human ear is more sensitive to higher frequency sound waves, which is why a high-C on a flute is heard better than a closing door.  Additionally, the flute also creates a more focused sound wave, which travels in a more direct path to the ear, allowing the sound to be heard more clearly.", "\n\nHuman: How do people on house arrest get the money they need to pay for the house they are confined in, or get groceries and such? Assuming they don't have a family member or roommate.\n\nAssistant: They usually get money from family or friends to pay for their house and groceries. They may also be able to access funds from social services or a charity.", "\n\nHuman: What's monism?\n\nWell, to narrow it down, I have this idea that Platonism, Neoplatonism, philosophers of Alexandria, Pythagoras, Judaism, Christianity, Descartes etc pretty much all tell that soul and body are separate things, soul is above, body is below and is dependent on the soul, a kind of disdain for physical nature of things and the senses etc etc. But I don't have a good definition of monism. What is it in opposition to that?\n\n(Please don't make it encyclopaedic or too complicated, ELI5)\n\nAssistant: Monism is the philosophical view that all of reality is made up of one single substance. It is the opposite of dualism, which holds that reality is made up of two substances. Monism holds that the physical and the spiritual are both aspects of a single reality, and that the two can be reconciled. Monism also holds that the physical world is ultimately real and that the spiritual world is a projection of the physical world. \n\nSome examples of monism include idealism, which holds that reality is mental or spiritual in nature, and panpsychism, which holds that consciousness is", "\n\nHuman: Why do the Canadian and Australian dolllar always seems to be at near parity?\n\nIt seems like it has been like that for years.  Their economies seem to be quite different yet the exchange rate is almost always near 1. \n\nAssistant: The Canadian and Australian dollar have been at near parity for quite some time, as the Canadian dollar has been relatively strong compared to other currencies.  The Canadian economy is heavily reliant on commodities, while the Australian economy is heavily reliant on services.  This has resulted in the two currencies trading near parity for the past few years.", "\n\nHuman: Why does milk claiming no rbST always carry the disclaimer that \"No significant difference has been shown in milk from cows treated with the artificial growth hormone rbST and non rbST treated cows\"?\n\nAssistant: The disclaimer is required by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to the lack of significant scientific evidence demonstrating a difference between milk from cows treated with rbST and non-rbST treated cows. The FDA requires that any milk produced from cows treated with rbST must be labeled with the disclaimer.", "\n\nHuman: If viruses such as Ebola have no cure, how come some people recover from the disease?\n\nHow come the virus doesn't keep multiplying until it kills the person?\n\nAssistant: Viruses such as Ebola can be managed with supportive care, including rehydration, nutrition, and treatment of symptoms. Some people do recover from the virus, although the mortality rate is high. The virus doesn't keep multiplying because the body's immune system is able to fight it off.", "\n\nHuman: how can there be hundreds of thousands of privately owned restaurants and bars if the industry has such a dramatic fail rate?\n\nYou often hear how non-corporate bars and restaurants have a very high failure rate, (the usual statistic you hear is 90%), and that the ones that do not fail don't really make much money, so how can millions of them exist under these conditions? \n\nAssistant: The hospitality industry is highly competitive and it is difficult for restaurants and bars to stay open and profitable. The industry has low profit margins, so it can be difficult for small businesses to stay afloat. Many restaurants and bars rely on loyal customers and word of mouth to survive and thrive. Additionally, some restaurants and bars have adapted to the changing market by offering unique experiences, specializing in certain cuisines, or catering to specific demographics.", "\n\nHuman: How do radio staions find out ratings?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: Why is there such a controversy about implementation of the Common Core curriculum?\n\nI am surrounded by homeschool families in my area whom I love dearly but cringe at most of their outcries of perceived persecution. The newest soapbox is a rally against the Common Core curriculum and all it represents, but I am so out of the loop on this matter I don't know how to discuss this. These are the same people who rally against vaccines, so I am cautious about most of their claims.\n\nAssistant: What specific claims are they making about the Common Core curriculum?", "\n\nHuman: Why are humans smarter than computers if computers can do billions of computations per second and store many times more data than the human brain?\n\nAssistant: Because computers can only do the tasks they are programmed to do.", "\n\nHuman: How come adblocking isn't considered piracy or stealing?\n\nAssistant: Because it's not. Adblocking is a technology used to prevent websites from displaying unwanted ads. It is not considered piracy or stealing since it does not involve taking away any content from the website.", "\n\nHuman: What happens if you're not a citizen of any country?\n\nGot me curious, if I lost or got rid of citizenship to a country what would I identify myself as?\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: Explain: The concept of absolute nothingness before the big bang.\n\nAssistant: Absolute nothingness before the big bang is the concept of a state of complete emptiness and absence of matter and energy. This is in contrast to the current state of the universe, which is filled with matter and energy. Prior to the big bang, the universe was filled with an extremely dense, hot, and pressurized state of matter and energy which eventually led to the big bang and the formation of the universe.", "\n\nHuman: How Does Intel Turbo Boost Work?\n\nDoes it just temporarily overclock the CPU or what?\n\nAssistant: It temporarily overclocks the CPU, enabling higher performance in certain workloads.", "\n\nHuman: Why you can only recycle plastic with the numbers 1 or 2 on it\n\nWhy even make so many different numbers available if the only thing that is usually recycled is bottles or items with the number 1 or 2 inside the recycling triangle?\n\nAssistant: Plastic recycling is a complex process that requires specialized equipment and technology to sort and clean the plastic, and the number on the plastic helps identify what type of plastic it is. The numbers 1 and 2 are the most commonly recycled plastics because they are easier to process and can be recycled into a variety of products. The other numbers represent different types of plastics that are not as commonly recycled.", "\n\nHuman: Why do some parts of the body hurt when other parts are damaged?\n\nFor example, I was doing a high kick in karate and bruised the top of my foot near my ankle. But the toe next to my pinkie toe is what's hurting. \n\nOr when I get a crink in my neck and my forehead starts hurting as if I was laying down and dropped my phone on my face. \n\nI realize that these parts are close enough physically and in function that if one part hurts then the other might, but why is it that the unhurt part hurts more than the hurt part?\n\nAssistant: Because the nerve endings in the human body are interconnected, when one part is injured or in pain, it can cause other parts to be sensitive or even hurt. The sensation may be referred pain, meaning the pain is not coming from the location of the original injury, but from another part of the body.  This is why a headache can cause pain in the neck and shoulders, or why a sprained ankle can cause pain in the knee.", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: Toilet seats are designed to be replaceable and are typically made of lightweight materials like plastic so that they can be removed and replaced if needed. The plastic bolts and wing nuts are used to secure the toilet seat in place and make it easier to remove.", "\n\nHuman: I'm 18 and have no idea how voting or any government positions are obtained.\n\nAssistant: What type of government position are you looking for?", "\n\nHuman: Why do cats wiggle their butts before they pounce?\n\nAssistant: To help them gain balance and a better grip on the ground.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because the Moon's surface reflects most of the light that reaches it, making it difficult to see objects on the surface. The equipment left by the Apollo astronauts was either dark colored or reflects very little light, making it difficult for ground and orbiting telescopes to detect.", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't the violent protesters in Baltimore considered/charged with terrorism?\n\nAre they not inciting terror on home soil? I feel like this would be taken more severely\n\nAssistant: They are not being charged with terrorism because the definition of terrorism is usually limited to violent acts intended to create fear and disruption in an attempt to achieve a political or ideological goal. The violent protesters in Baltimore are not trying to achieve a political or ideological goal, but rather are expressing their frustration with the system.  Therefore, they are not being charged with terrorism.", "\n\nHuman: Explain: The Internet\n\nAssistant: The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that enables computer devices to connect and exchange data. It allows people to access vast amounts of information, communicate with others, and purchase goods and services.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible to be told something you didn't know, in a dream?\n\nI had a dream where someone told me something I didn't know. But how is that possible if it's MY dream? \nShouldn't my brain know what I already know?\n\nAssistant: It is possible for knowledge to be conveyed in a dream in several ways. It could be that you were unaware of something in your waking life and it was revealed to you in your dream. It could also be that you dreamt of someone teaching you something or that you were given information in some other way. It could also be that the information was meant to come to you in a dream and your unconscious mind was able to provide it.", "\n\nHuman: How does currency (e.g. Zimbabwe Money) inflate so rapidly?\n\nAssistant: It is caused by an excessive increase in the amount of money available relative to the amount of goods and services in the economy. This can be due to a government printing too much money, or a speculative investment boom, or a commodity price boom leading to an increase in the cost of goods and services.", "\n\nHuman: How come wood or paint becomes reflective the finer the sanding process go?\n\nI\u2019ve always wondered how a really opaque non reflective material becomes quite glossy and reflective with just really smooth sanding?\n\nLike paint, as I buff it, it becomes real shiny and smooth, and reflective. Even wood when sanding up to 5000 grit or higher!\n\nAssistant: What type of material is it?", "\n\nHuman: Is there any scientific reasoning for beginners luck?\n\nAssistant: There is no scientific reasoning for beginners luck. It may simply be that more experienced players have developed strategies and techniques which they use to reduce their risk of making a mistake, while less experienced players may not have had the opportunity to do so. As such, when they take a risk, they may be more likely to get lucky.", "\n\nHuman: Why does America have so much more firepower than the rest of the world?\n\nAssistant: Firepower is relative to the size of a country's military budget. The United States spends more on its military than any other country in the world, and so has access to the most advanced weapons.", "\n\nHuman: How do zip ties actually provide better traction for bike tires in the snow?\n\nI know it provides traction but the thickness of zip ties are so thin and the material is so smooth, and while I can imagine it would add some traction , I can't imagine it being that effective in snow past 3 inches \n\n\n**unless I searched wrong I didn't see anything come up in this subreddit \n\nAssistant: What else would you like to know?", "\n\nHuman: Does Google make less money, because Android is Open Source?\n\nAssistant: No, Google makes more money from Android because it can monetize the platform through services like Google Play and ads.", "\n\nHuman: How can some people suffer from both anxiety and depression at the same time?\n\nAssistant: Depression and anxiety are often co-occurring disorders, meaning they can occur together. People with both disorders may experience intense feelings of sadness, fear and worry, as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue, difficulty sleeping or eating, and difficulty concentrating.", "\n\nHuman: Gut bacteria.\n\nHow'd it get there? I couldn't have been born with it, but it's there and integral to my digestive system. Where did it come from? \n\nAssistant: Well, it's possible that it was passed down from your parents or siblings, or it could have been acquired through diet or contact with other people.  It's also possible that it could have been acquired through contact with animals, such as pets or farm animals.", "\n\nHuman: why does comcast Internet slow down despite offering 20+mbps\n\nAssistant: How can I help you?", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many people from the Middle-East bitter towards Western civilization?\n\nI was reflecting on 9/11 a bit and I realized, how could people be so bitter that they would sacrifice their entire life just to damage a culture / society that is completely different and far away from their own?\n\nAssistant: I think that the answer is complex and multifaceted, but one of the main reasons is due to historical and ongoing conflicts between the Middle East and Western countries. In particular, many people from the Middle East feel that Western countries have used their resources, invaded their countries, and imposed their own political and economic systems on them. This has led to deep resentment and anger towards Western civilization as a whole. Additionally, some people in the Middle East view Western civilization as being largely responsible for the current state of their countries and their lack of progress, which has further fueled anti-West", "\n\nHuman: DFA to GNFA\n\nHey guys,\n\n\n\nI have no clue if this is the correct place to be asking this question - but I figured I might as well ask. Is there a way, that is somewhat easy to remember, that will help you go through the steps in creating a GNFA (generalized nondeterministic finite state automaton) from a DFA? It is hard for me to get all the regular expressions right so I am probably doing something wrong.\n\nI hope you can help me get it right and explain the correct approach.\n\n\n\nTldr / eli5 - I suck at converting a DFA to a GNFA - teach me how.

Is it important?\n\nI see everytime that some brand of juice is 100% juice from concentrate. In organge juices we find fresh squeezed. But for juices of other fruits we almost always find them to be from concentrate. If they are diluting a concentrate to make it similar to the water content of freshly squeezed juice why not just call it juice? \n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: What is a lien on a house and how does it work?\n\nAssistant: A lien on a house is a legal claim against the property that must be satisfied before the property can be sold or transferred. It is typically used to ensure that a creditor is paid for services or goods provided to the owner of the property. For example, if a contractor performs work on a house and is not paid, the contractor can place a lien on the house until the debt is repaid.", "\n\nHuman: - Will someone explain what the differences are between Republicans and \"Tea Party\" members?\n\nAssistant: The main difference between Republicans and Tea Party members is their political ideology. Republicans generally support limited government involvement in people's lives, low taxes, and free markets. Tea Party members are more likely to be socially and fiscally conservative, and are strongly against big government and government spending. They also tend to be very concerned about the country's financial health and are more likely to support small government, lower taxes, and less regulation.", "\n\nHuman: Were our teeth naturally supposed to be yellow? And is it actually healthy for them to be white?\n\nAssistant: Yes, human teeth are naturally supposed to be yellow. The color of human teeth is mainly determined by the presence of a mineral called calcium carbonate which is found in teeth enamel. Teeth whitening products can help to lighten the color of teeth, but it is not necessarily healthy to have white teeth. It is natural for teeth to become more yellow as we age due to the wear and tear of everyday life.", "\n\nHuman: Why did the US drop two atomic bombs in Japan?\n\nInspired by [This video] (https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/43wsdi/history_of_japan/) can someone ELI5 why The US dropped two atomic bombs to Japan but not elsewhere...?\n\nAssistant: The US dropped two atomic bombs to Japan because they wanted to force Japan to surrender in World War II. The US wanted to avoid a costly invasion of Japan, and believed that the atomic bombs would cause enough damage to force Japan to surrender without the need of an invasion.", "\n\nHuman: When money is donated to fight cancer and support cancer research, how exactly does it help?\n\nAssistant: Cancer research is an incredibly complex process that involves numerous steps. Generally, the money donated to fight cancer is used to fund research into new treatments, such as drugs, vaccines, and therapies, as well as research into the causes of cancer and how it can be prevented. Additionally, donations help to fund clinical trials, which test new treatments and make them available to patients. Cancer research also helps to develop diagnostic tools, such as imaging technologies, to better detect the disease in its early stages. Finally, funds are used to support the patients and their", "\n\nHuman: Why can't we accurately predict the weather?\n\nAssistant: Weather prediction is a complex process that involves a variety of factors, including atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed and direction, and other variables. It is difficult to accurately predict the weather on a local or global scale due to the complexity of the system. We can, however, use forecasting models to make predictions with increasing accuracy.", "\n\nHuman: When the UN condemns a country, what actually happens to said country? And what garners a condemnation?\n\nAssistant: A condemnation by the United Nations generally leads to economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and political pressure. It can also result in Security Council referrals to the International Criminal Court or to a specialized tribunal.", "\n\nHuman: Why do lights and stars sometimes appear to have points sticking out of them?\n\nLike, when you look at a star you'll sometimes see 4 points sticking out diagonally, why does that occur?\n\nAssistant: I believe this question is more appropriate for a science or astronomy forum. I'm sorry, but I can't answer this question.", "\n\nHuman: Why does Russia seem to have an inordinate amount of big meteor impacts?\n\nAssistant: It is true that Russia has had a few more large meteor impacts than average. This is likely due to its large size and the fact that it sits at the same latitude as the Mediterranean Sea, making it particularly susceptible to impacts from asteroids and meteoroids in the Earth-crossing path of the asteroid belt.", "\n\nHuman: How do you learn to keep a beat?\n\nOkay, I'm way beyond five and not at all a musically gifted person, but I even have a hard time tapping my foot along to a song without looking like I'm suffering from involuntary spasms.

The number of possible combinations is much higher, so while the odds of someone winning a big jackpot are still slim, they are much more likely than getting hit by lightning.", "\n\nHuman: Why have male testosterone levels been dropping for the last 60 years?\n\nAssistant: Because of environmental factors, such as air and water pollution, diet, stress, and lifestyle choices.", "\n\nHuman: How could cheap paper towels (or anything, really) rip in the middle of the sheet when pulled and not ALWAYS on the perforation line?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: How is the windows registry organized and how does it work?\n\nI've been reading about it for about an hour but it's way over my head, I'm not very tech savvy and I have to do a presentation on it for my intro to computer operating systems class. Thanks for any help.\n\nEDIT: The presentation went remarcably well and my instructor actually commended me on the use of an analogy to help everyone understand a complex subject.\n\nAssistant: The windows registry is organized like a hierarchical database, with each key representing a folder and each value representing an item within the folder. The registry stores information about the hardware, software, and settings of the computer, so it can be accessed and modified quickly. This way, if the user wants to change the screen resolution, they can just go to the registry and change the value associated with the \"screen resolution\" key, rather than having to go through multiple menus to find the setting.", "\n\nHuman: How is it that humans advanced more rapidly based on where they lived geographically?\n\nI was thinking specifically about how the Native Americans were so far behind in comparison to the Europeans when they visited North America.\n\nAssistant: The geographical location of a population can have a great impact on its advancement. For example, people living in coastal regions have access to more resources and trade opportunities than those living inland. Similarly, people living near rivers and other water sources have access to easier transportation and can develop more advanced forms of agriculture. This is why civilizations have tended to advance more rapidly in certain geographical areas.", "\n\nHuman: Why do some people get lint in their bellybuttons amd other people dont?\n\nI get it in my belly button and my girlfriend doesn't. Just curious. Also I'm kinda haory, she is not.\n\nAssistant: Well, it could be due to hygiene. Some people are more prone to getting lint in their bellybutton because they are more likely to have more skin-to-clothing contact and thus more friction, which leads to more lint accumulation. Additionally, some people may just have more hair in their bellybutton than others.", "\n\nHuman: Why does a bubble pop with no human intervention?\n\nAssistant: Because the pressure inside the bubble is higher than the pressure outside the bubble, it causes the bubble to expand and eventually pop.", "\n\nHuman: Can some explain DRM LI5?\n\nwhat's the fuss?\n\nAssistant: I can explain Digital Rights Management (DRM) to you.

DRM systems may use encryption, passwords, and other techniques to control access to digital content.", "\n\nHuman: What is municipal broadband and why is it so controversial?\n\nAssistant: Municipal broadband is a type of broadband service that is provided by a local government or a local community. It is often seen as an alternative to private sector broadband providers, such as cable and phone companies. The main benefit of municipal broadband is that it is typically cheaper than private sector broadband and it can provide better connection speeds. However, it is controversial because some people worry that it could lead to higher taxes, as well as government control of the internet.", "\n\nHuman: Why does air in a balloon increases its weight?\n\nI get the idea of basically adding mass to the balloon which should make it require more force to pick up and therefore be heavier (at least i think that's how this works).\n\nAlthough if i were to fill the balloon with sth less dense than air, like helium, it certainly would feel much lighter (if i put it on a scale, would it also show me a lesser weight than the one of an empty balloon?) or would even float/fly on its own.\n\nif that is true, another question for me would be where the sweet spot is. What features would a substance have to have for me to put an arbitrary amount of it into a balloon without changing its weight on a scale?\n\nAssistant: The ideal substance would be one that is less dense than air, has a low viscosity, is odorless, and is non-toxic.", "\n\nHuman: the evolution of the beard\n\nWhat evolutionary advantage is there for men growing facial hair? Why do not all men have the ability to grow facial hair and why don't women (in general) have any?\n\nAssistant: What is the history of facial hair on humans?", "\n\nHuman: The No-Slip Condition\n\nI am taking Fluid Mechanics this semester and one of the first topics covered was the No-Slip Condition, but the actual mechanics (?) of why at the boundary the fluid has a velocity of zero wasn't really explained. I understand that there's a frictional force, but is that it, the book mentions even in the case where the solid was completely smooth, non-porous, that the fluid would still have a velocity of zero. Fellow engineers, physicists or chemists, can ya help me out?\n\nAssistant: Hi, I'm happy to help. The no-slip condition states that the velocity of a fluid at the wall of a container is zero. This is due to the frictional force between the wall of the container and the fluid. This frictional force is caused by the irregularities in the surface of the wall, as well as the roughness of the molecules of the fluid. Even if the wall was perfectly smooth and non-porous, the no-slip condition would still hold because the molecules of the fluid are constantly colliding with the wall and experiencing the frictional force.", "\n\nHuman: Why can't we just use MAC addreses instead of the IP addreses?\n\nAssistant: That would be possible, however, it would require an additional level of trust since MAC addreses are typically part of the hardware configuration of the device.

But Russia knows that no one else is really ok with this, and now they're (openly) sending weapons and such. Why do they continue to back Assad, knowing it will only anger the international community?\n\nAssistant: They likely view their support of the Assad regime as a strategic move in the Syrian Civil War and believe that it is in their best interests to maintain a strong ally in the region. They may also be concerned about the potential instability of a post-Assad Syria, as well as the potential for a power vacuum to be filled by a group hostile to Russian interests. Additionally, Russia may see the Assad regime as an important partner in the fight against terrorism and as a bulwark against Western influence in the region.", "\n\nHuman: Why is the limit for individual contributions to campaigns $2700 but Super PACs don't have a limit?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The limit for individual contributions to campaigns is $2700 because it is set by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.

Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: What is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle?\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. This is due to the fact that when you measure one value, you always introduce a degree of uncertainty in the other. This is because the more precisely you measure the momentum, the less precisely you can measure the position, and vice versa. This principle is widely used in quantum mechanics to explain the behavior of particles at the smallest scales of matter and energy.", "\n\nHuman: Why can a particle not reach absolute zero?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because particles can only reach a certain minimum temperature, known as absolute zero, which is -273.15 degrees Celsi", "\n\nHuman: What will happen to the price of gold if the US government defaults on its debt?\n\nI have a question: if the US government defaults, that will cause uncertainty in the market, and people move their money into safe options, like gold and US bonds, right?\n\nSo, if the US defaults on their debt, will that drive the price of gold up to ridiculously high levels, since the latter just defaulted?\n\nAnd, as a valuations student, do I need to find a new risk-free rate when valuating companies?\n\nOn a related note, what are some other safe options in uncertain times?

Metal is often associated with youth rebellion and a more energetic lifestyle, while pop is often seen as more mainstream and less exciting. These associations are largely cultural and subjective, and can vary greatly by individual.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is a memory, on an atomic level?\n\nIn order to retrieve a memory, the neurons have to access it somehow. I wonder how the memory of what you had for breakfast is different on am atomic level than the memory of your first kiss.\n\nAssistant: Well, a memory is the result of a complex network of neurons firing signals in the brain. It's not something that can be easily defined on an atomic level. However, we do know that memories are formed when connections between neurons are strengthened and altered by experience and learning. These connections are encoded with specific information which is then retrieved when needed. So, the memory of what you had for breakfast and the memory of your first kiss are both stored in the same way, as a network of neurons firing signals. The difference is in the information that is encoded and retrieved.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids need to avoid fluoride in their toothpaste but adults are told it's beneficial to have?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: Why is it easier to whistle after licking your lips?\n\nAfter wetting your lips, it is much easier to get a good tone and more accurate pitch.

This paradox is named after Bertrand Russell, who first stated it in 1901. \n\nIn other words, if a set contains itself as a member, then it cannot also be a member of the set of all sets that are not members of themselves.

Though from what I know they bind to the same receptors? How does the structure make it more powerful?\n\nAssistant: Fentanyl and sufentanyl are both opioids, and they both bind to the same mu receptors in the brain and body. However, the structure of fentanyl and sufentanyl makes them much more powerful than other opioids because they are more potent agonists at the mu receptor. This means they can produce a stronger effect, which is why they are used for more severe pain.", "\n\nHuman: Why do most MMO's have reset on a Tuesday?\n\nI can vouch for FFXIV and WoW.

This can make the old stores' money worth less, as people will switch to the new store for cheaper prices. \n\nNow, why can't a country just create more money? This can lead to inflation, which is an increase in the price of goods and services. This can cause people to lose faith in the currency, resulting in a decrease in its value.

Or when a video buffering on a page seems to be stuck, reloading seems to help it sometimes.\n\nAssistant: It could be that the page has already loaded some of the content that is needed and reloading the page just finishes loading the rest of the content.

I went out to smoke and brought the dogs with so they can potty. Instead of pottying the dogs ran to me with rubber Frisbees.

Additionally, the vendors may be able to purchase the merchandise from third-party vendors who have obtained the licenses to sell the merchandise.", "\n\nHuman: How has Mercury maintained it's orbit around the Sun?\n\nOk now I understand the high school science class explanation to this being that Mercury has it's own gravitational field and has essentially managed to maintain it's own orbit around the Sun. Even with that oversimplified explanation don't we still take the Sun's mass into consideration? I don't know in exact terms how much larger the Sun is compared to Mercury but it is certainly considerable many times over? I know I could probably google this but I would like to hear if anyone else has ever wondered this! (I will probably look this up on Youtube for a more scientific explanation...)   \n\nAssistant: The gravitational pull of the Sun on Mercury is much weaker than the gravitational pull of the Earth on the Moon, even though the Sun is much more massive than Mercury. This is because the distance between the two bodies is much greater. The gravitational force between two bodies decreases with the square of the distance between them. So, although the Sun is much more massive than Mercury, its gravitational pull is much weaker because Mercury is much further away.", "\n\nHuman: What does it mean when a market matures?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: What does it mean when a market matures?", "\n\nHuman: I see soaps with grapefruit, pineapple, hibiscus, yogurt, quinoa, tea, avocado, etc. in them.

I know well how RAM, the CPU, and the GPU work, as well as other components, but I am not entirely sure how the System keeps track what RAM is in use by what. Wouldn't there have to be some portion of memory dedicated to keeping track of these things?   \nBut then surely there would need to be a loop or something that constantly checks for a memory request and figures out how to do things (like the kernel) correct? (Also please give an explanation that is easy to understand, but I know how a computer works). Thanks in advance.\n\n\nAssistant: Yes, the OS keeps track of which RAM is in use by which programs by using a technique called memory mapping. When a program is loaded onto the computer, the OS assigns a specific memory address to each of the program\u2019s components. This allows the OS to keep track of which memory locations are in use by which programs. The memory mapping process also allows the OS to dynamically allocate memory to programs as they need it.", "\n\nHuman: Why carbohydrates are at the bottom of the pyramid and sugar at the top, when they're basically the same thing (glucose)?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a good question.

Astronomers can also detect them indirectly by observing the way they affect the emission from nearby sources, such as the way they heat up surrounding gas and dust or the way they cause an increase in the frequency of gravitational waves passing by.", "\n\nHuman: If we're fairly certain that global climate change is happening, why do we continue to build anything on the coasts?\n\nSeems like at some point it's going to be a terrible, terrible idea. \n\nAssistant: Because people need places to live.

Rods are more sensitive to light and dark, and are responsible for night vision. Cones are responsible for color vision and are more sensitive to bright light. When looking at a bright light, the cones are overwhelmed and the light is too bright to look at with both eyes. But since the rods are more sensitive to light, closing one eye allows us to see the light without overloading the cones.", "\n\nHuman: How does this trick \"magic\" circuit work?\n\nHere's the original video: _URL_0_\n\nIt shows a guy assembling what appears to be a very simple circuit of 3 switches, 3 LEDs, and a battery in series.

How can they charge so much less for the same goods?\n\nAssistant: The prices are lower because Wal-mart is able to buy items in bulk and get discounts from vendors, as well as negotiate lower prices on certain items.

If the pill is supposed to be taken daily, why not stop at 100%?\n\nFor example, I take a daily B12 supplement that, according to the label, contains 50,000% of my daily value of B12. If it's intended to be daily, wouldn't 100% of my daily value of B12 suffice?\n\nAssistant: That's a great question. The daily values (DV) listed on supplements and vitamins are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Since most adults need more than 2,000 calories per day, the percent daily values are higher than 100%. For example, a 2,000 calorie diet would need 2.4 micrograms of vitamin B12 per day, but the percent daily value for B12 on your supplement is 50,000%.

Common triggers include:\n\u2022 Stress and anxiety\n\u2022 Fear and phobias\n\u2022 Trauma\n\u2022 Extreme emotions\n\u2022 Physical sensations such as hyperventilation, dizziness, or heart palpitations\n\u2022 Situations that remind the person of a past trauma\n\u2022 Changes in environment, such as going to a new place or being in a crowded place\n\u2022 Certain foods, drinks, or medications\n\u2022 Extreme exhaustion or lack of sleep\n\u2022 Caffeine", "\n\nHuman: Why is food (and other things) preserved when it is frozen?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the process for preserving food when it is frozen?\n\nFood is preserved when it is frozen by a process called freeze-drying. This process involves freezing the food quickly and then removing the ice crystals from the food by sublimation, a process in which the ice crystals change directly from a solid to a gas. This leaves the food in a semi-solid state, allowing it to be stored without spoiling.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: Well, unfortunately that is the reality for many people who have terminal illnesses. It's not uncommon for symptoms to be present for a long time before the diagnosis is made, or for the disease to progress slowly before reaching an advanced stage.  This can be due to a variety of factors, such as the type of cancer, how quickly it is growing, and the individual's overall health. In some cases, there may not be any symptoms until the disease is in an advanced stage.", "\n\nHuman: In a hostage situation, where the assailant is holding the hostages in a contained location, why can they not use some sort of gas/chemical that knocks out everyone inside?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What type of gas/chemical?", "\n\nHuman: The Mt.

Gox interacts with the bitcoin community and how it has effected bitcoin in recent news.  Any simplification would be greatly appreciated!\n\nedit: Also, what are the long term ramifications of the current Mt. Gox situation?\n\nAssistant: Mt. Gox is a bitcoin exchange that stopped operating in February 2014 due to a security breach that resulted in the loss of over 850,000 bitcoins. This security breach caused a massive drop in the value of bitcoin and caused a great deal of uncertainty in the bitcoin community. The long term effects of the Mt.

But why does street food not really seem to be a thing here in the US? I've lived in three different states and never really seen it. There are a couple of food trucks and that's it.

The answer is not entirely clear, but it is likely that our ability to recognize and process complex vocal language is a product of our evolutionary history and our uniquely human cognitive abilities. For example, our ability to process linguistic information is likely aided by our larger brains and our advanced auditory processing skills. Additionally, our advanced language abilities may be a product of our long-term social and cultural evolution, which has allowed us to develop more complex language systems.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the links on the Frontpage so old?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: How does Hamming code work?\n\nI understand regular parity with one bit telling you if there is an even or odd amount of 1 bits in your data, but how does Hamming code work?\n\nAssistant: Hamming code works by adding a certain number of redundant bits to the data. This helps to detect and correct errors in the data. For example, if you have a 4 bit data value and Hamming code, the data is encoded as 00011000. This has an even number of bits, so any single bit error would be detected. If the data was 00111000, it would have an odd number of bits and any single bit error would not be detected.", "\n\nHuman: US Economic Crisis\n\nplease, a very straight forward explanation and as simple as you can.

It seems like for them to be able to know about your account balances with a different CU, they'd have to have full access, which would lead me to believe that all CUs that offer this (the ability to access/manage accounts from other CU branches) would have to be on the same/a similar system.

As the hydrogen in the core of the sun is converted into helium, it releases energy in the form of radiation and heat. This energy and heat causes the outer layers of the sun to expand, which is why the sun is getting brighter and warmer over time. This energy and heat also causes the outer layers of the sun to move away from the core, where the helium is being created. This movement of material causes the sun to slowly increase in size, but it will never become a", "\n\nHuman: How can a online bank give 1.50% interest per month on your money and still make a profit?\n\nLike the reanaut bank, the ingDiba and other direct banks. \nThey say in their contracts that you get 1.50% **per month**.\nDoes that really mean that I get 15$ per month when I put 1000$ on that bank account?\nSorry for any gramatical errors.

This is known as the 'cruise stage' and the rider in the yellow jersey usually takes it easy and rides at a more relaxed pace. This is to make sure they arrive in Paris with the yellow jersey.

How come you can't pick up 1000lbs just because you want, but  with adrenaline you're able too and being able to survive insane situations \n\nAssistant: Adrenaline is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands which are located on top of the kidneys. It is responsible for a number of physiological and psychological responses in the body, such as increased alertness, increased respiration rate, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, increased blood glucose level and increased blood clotting. These responses help the body to cope with stressful situations, giving the person a surge of energy and strength.

I can close these apps in this version of iOS if I swipe up, but before this feature was available were tons of different threads just running without any way to close them? What was the mechanism for closing these apps? Were they closed as soon as you exited?\n\nAssistant: They were closed when you exited.

An unprotected hour in the sun will lead to a pretty nasty burn. How come in the winter I can stay outside all day with my face and hands exposed and not get burned at all? Technically in the northern hemisphere we are closer to the sun in the winter. \n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: I know that even though atoms are mostly empty space, we can't walk through walls because of electric fields, but if they're mostly empty, why isn't everything practically invisible?\n\nIf atoms are mostly empty space, why can we see them like there's no empty space at all?\n\nAssistant: Because atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons, which have mass, and the electromagnetic force that binds them together causes them to be visible. The electrons are negatively charged and thus create an electric field that pushes back on any other electric field, like light, causing it to be visible.  The atoms' mass also causes them to absorb some of the light's energy, which gives them their color.", "\n\nHuman: How did the moon get there?\n\nHow did the moon come to be?\n\nAssistant: The moon is believed to have been created from the debris left over from the original formation of the Earth. As the Earth and the other planets in our solar system coalesced, a large body of dust and gas was formed. This dust and gas was eventually pulled together to form the Earth, and the debris that was left over was pulled together to form the moon. Over time, the moon's orbit changed and its gravitational pull shifted, which caused the ocean levels to rise and fall, resulting in the formation of the moon's distinctive features.", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What else would you like to know?", "\n\nHuman: How Does Debris From a Tornado Always End Up Hundres of Miles Away?\n\nI live near where the recent tornado tore through in Central Illinois, and I keep hearing reports of debris being found up near Chicago.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Wet things absorb more smells. For example, when you walk by a pile of freshly cut grass, the scent is much stronger when it\u2019s wet than when it\u2019s dry. Wet surfaces also tend to be warmer, which encourages more rapid evaporation and the release of more volatile compounds into the atmosphere. Additionally, the molecules of water can act as a bridge between two surfaces, allowing molecules of odoriferous compounds to more easily come into contact with each other and thus transfer their scents.", "\n\nHuman: How is aspiration pneumonia not more common among marijuana vaporizer users?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

What's involved in swearing an oath that would make you tell the truth? Is it swearing on a bible? So is it just Christains then?\n\nAssistant: It's not just Christians. In many cultures, it's believed that swearing an oath on a higher power can strengthen the oath and make it more binding. In some cases, it can be as simple as swearing on a stack of papers or a glass of water. But in many countries, it is customary to swear on a bible or other religious text.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Did it seem like the person you were talking to was being purposefully vague or difficult to understand?", "\n\nHuman: the mechanism allowing or causing flowers to track the sun as it moves across the sky.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the mechanism allowing or causing flowers to track the sun as it moves across the sky?", "\n\nHuman: How I'm productive at the library as opposed to being lazy and drowsy at home?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: What is the difference between eating less and exercising more in terms of calories?\n\nSay I eat 1000 calories a day or eating 2500 and burning 1500 through excercise? Isn't it just a net 1000 calories eaten that day to burn on your usual activities?\n\nAssistant: Yes, that is correct. Eating less and exercising more is the same as eating 1000 calories fewer per day and burning an additional 1000 calories through exercise. This would result in a net 1000 calorie deficit, resulting in weight loss.", "\n\nHuman: Why don't computers drive trains, instead of people?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because computers are not strong enough to pull the weight of a train.", "\n\nHuman: How do fighter jet flares work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the most important information I should know about fighter jet flares?", "\n\nHuman: If weight is based on gravity on an object, is the weight on another planet for the same object proportional?\n\n\n\nAssistant: No, the weight of an object is not proportional to the planet's gravity. The force of gravity is proportional to the mass of the planet, which is why objects with more mass, like the Earth, experience a greater gravitational pull than objects with less mass, like satellites.", "\n\nHuman: Why do nipples become hard in the cold?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the unit of work capacity in the SI system?", "\n\nHuman: Does a charge of attempted murder include all of the crimes that go into the attempt?\n\nIf you say try to murder someone by kidnapping them, beating them up and then stabbing them several times, is the kidnapping and beating and stabbing included in the attempted murder charge or are all actions charged in addition to the attempted murder?\n\nHow does the law handle that?\n\nAssistant: No, the charge of attempted murder does not include all of the crimes that go into the attempt. Attempted murder is charged separately for the crime of attempting to commit murder.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: how Tor and Vidalia work and what they do\n\nEvery couple of months a renewed fascination with the \"Deep net\" and .onion sites crops up, and every time the site (browser? host? I actually have no idea) Tor gets thrown around. I've pretty much gleamed that it allows you to browse the internet anonymously, somehow, and that it grants access to sites not typically available via standard search engine searches.\n\nSo what is it? What's the big deal about it?\n\nAssistant: Tor is an open-source software that allows users to browse the internet anonymously by encrypting their activity and sending it through a network of servers located around the world. It is used to access hidden or restricted websites and services, as well as to protect online privacy and security.\n\nVidalia is an application for the Tor network that allows users to access the dark web and other hidden services. It provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface for setting up and using the Tor network.", "\n\nHuman: Why is there no law against fake button ads?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: LinkedIn (LNKD) is trading at $191.41 right now, but Microsoft has agreed to buy them for $196 a share in an all-cash deal.

Why do you think they are not trading at around $196?", "\n\nHuman: Is happiness \"real\", or just a bunch of chemicals and hormones triggered by something? How does it work?\n\nAnd what is the difference between natural happiness and drug induced happiness?\n\nAssistant: Natural happiness is the feeling of joy and contentment that comes from within, often as a result of positive experiences, such as spending time with loved ones, achieving a personal goal, or just having a good day. Drug induced happiness is the feeling of joy and contentment that comes from external sources, such as drugs, alcohol, or other substances. This feeling is often short-lived and can lead to addiction and other negative outcomes.", "\n\nHuman: Has the physiological damage caused by trauma been the same through out history?\n\nI hear many stories of people being raped or kidnapped and tortured and the person suffers physiological damaged for years, possibly for life. However, in the past rape and torture and all manors of horrible harm were infected on people on a routine basis. Was nearly everyone in the past emotionally and physiologically damaged from the struggle of day to day life, or does our modern soft life make us more susceptible to physiological and emotional pain? \n\nAssistant: What type of physiological damage are you referring to?", "\n\nHuman: Why does binary have to be \"1\"s and \"0\"s?\n\nAside from us naming it *binary*... why does code only work as 1's and 0's? Could 2 be used as 'maybe/also' to incorporate more complex coding?\n\nAssistant: Binary code is made up of 1's and 0's because it is the most efficient way to store information in a computer. Each bit, or binary digit, can represent one of two values: 1 or 0. By using a series of 1's and 0's, computers can store a lot of information in a very small space.", "\n\nHuman: Why don't people on a hijacked plane ever try to fight back for control?\n\nI've always wondered why they never try to fight for their lives.

So my question is why don't hostages fight back or are they not aware of what is happening?\n\nEdit: Wow, I learned so much from this. I can see why some people wouldn't act and I never knew about the 4th plane, thanks for all the links/info!\n\nAssistant: No problem, glad to help. In general, people in this type of situation are often too shocked or disoriented to take action, and the hijackers have generally taken steps to ensure that the hostages cannot overpower them. Additionally, the situation is often so chaotic that it is difficult to know what is happening or what the hijackers\u2019 plan is. Lastly, some hostages may feel they have no choice but to comply in order to save the lives of the other hostages.", "\n\nHuman: Why do scantrons require you to use a No. 2 pencil?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: What transforms otherwise normal people into \"criminals\"?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the primary function of law enforcement?", "\n\nHuman: Why do 3rd world countries exist, or more specifically, how/why did they not advance while others did?\n\n**edit-** Some super good answers so far, but I think I'll hold off on marking it as answered until we get a bit more input. I'm guessing I'm not the only one that has questions about this kind of stuff! \n\nI have found myself thinking about this more and more lately, often speculating with my limited knowledge that a lot of it has been affected by the spread of different religions, as well as the actual success of other countries- i.e one country dominates and it's neighbor is crushed into 3rd worldliness ... or whatever.

Can't they just stop choking themselves when it gets sketchy? And once they pass out, doesn't the body automatically breathe for them/if applicable their partner would stop choking them?\n\nAssistant: The answer to your question is that people can accidentally die from auto-erotic asphyxiation for a variety of reasons. In some cases, people are unable to regulate the amount of pressure they are applying during auto-erotic asphyxiation, and this can lead to asphyxia. Additionally, people may not be aware of the risks associated with the activity and may not recognize the warning signs of asphyxia in time to save themselves. In some cases, people may pass out from the sensation of asphyxiation and then suffocate due to the loss of consciousness.

Why does my brain see that in such an ambiguously shaped thing?\n\nAssistant: The human brain is very good at seeing patterns, even in random or chaotic visual stimuli. This is known as the \u201cPareidolia\u201d effect, which is why we often see faces in things like clouds or rocks. It\u2019s likely that this is an evolutionary trait that helps us recognize patterns in our environment which could be a threat or a source of food.", "\n\nHuman: what is the reason for those few extra blank white pages in the back of a book?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

My limited understanding is that sailors are somehow able to use the wind to move their sailboat.\n\nBut what if the wind is blowing in a direction you don't want to go? What if there is no wind? It just seems like such an unreliable way to go about traveling, yet, I know that's how the pilgrims, Chris Columbus, Vikings, Pirates, and everyone else traveled and discovered the world centuries ago.\n\nWhat is this dark magic?!\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: How do we measure calories in a product?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I can't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: Because of budgetary constraints, most government agencies cannot afford to purchase or maintain their own secure networks. Therefore, they must rely on the public internet to conduct business. This means that their computers are vulnerable to malicious attacks from hackers. To protect against this, the government often emplo", "\n\nHuman: How the economy would be different if there were more jobs than people to fill them, instead of the other way around.\n\nI've thought about this a lot, and haven't managed to think of any way that it would be bad, which I assume means I'm missing something. \n\nAssistant: How would this affect the cost of living?", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: What type of sugar do you typically consume?", "\n\nHuman: What is a Gluon Particle?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A Gluon particle is a hypothet", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a Mexican plane cross to the US without autHorization or VISAs if they are requesting HELP?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What else can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: E8 (Mathematics)\n\n_URL_0_\n\nIs there any possible way to ELI5? \n\n\nAssistant: Yes, I can explain it to you.

I get that caffeine dehydrates you, but, how is there still a liquid?\n\nAssistant: It depends on the type of pop/soda. Some types contain a lot of sugar and very little liquid, so they will act more like a dessert than a beverage. Other types contain a lot of carbonation and very little liquid, so they will act more like a gas than a beverage. It also depends on how much you drink. Generally, drinking a few glasses of pop/soda per day is not likely to cause dehydration. However, drinking large amounts of pop/soda can lead to dehydration.", "\n\nHuman: Why does protesting work?

It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: This is an interesting observation. It's likely that the creators of these anime and manga stories choose to make their main characters children because it allows them to explore complex themes and situations in a more lighthearted way. It also provides a way to draw in younger audiences. Additionally, it allows the characters to have a greater sense of innocence and naivety, which often serves as a contrast to the more serious or darker themes in the story.", "\n\nHuman: What's a Flexible spending account?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A flexible spending account (FSA) is a type of savings account that allows you to set aside money for future expenses, such as health care and child care costs, on a tax-free and penalty-free basis.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it sometimes easier to concentrate when you close your eyes?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: How come yellow highlighter doesn't show up on paper when you photocopy it?\n\nMy mom showed me this when we worked at a hotel together. They would keep a master copy of papers that needed to be copied frequently. These master copies would say \"MASTER COPY\" across the paper in yellow highlighter. When you photocopied it, the highlighter didn't show up.

It was first discovered in the 19th century when scientists began to observe the effects of the Earth's rotation on the night sky. They noticed that the time of sunset and sunrise changes depending on the latitude and longitude of the observer. This led to the establishment of standard time zones, which are divided into 24 equal parts around the world.", "\n\nHuman: If we wanted to keeps a much sun generated heat away from earth, would we use reflective materials or white materials?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the primary function of the human brain?", "\n\nHuman: What could happen if South Korea attempted to take over the North? (The reason why they haven't thus far, i'm sure) And why hasn't China bothered to do so themselves?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question. The consequences of a South Korean invasion of the North would be dire. The North has a large military force and would likely fight back fiercely, leading to a large-scale conflict with heavy civilian casualties on both sides. Additionally, any attempt to annex the North would likely be met with strong opposition from the international community, as well as from China. China has been reluctant to intervene in the Korean conflict as it does not want to risk provoking the US, its main trading partner.", "\n\nHuman: Why is recording movies on the computer like using a screencast considered bad, but using a dvr on the tv is fine?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Recording movies on the computer is generally frowned upon due to copyright infringement.

If the action is bacterial, why doesn\u2019t it kill the bacteria involved?\n\nI\u2019ve had compost piles get hot enough that they smoked.  And more than once, I experimentally shoved sticks in them and pulled them out later to find them blackened and smoking.  \n\nIs this entirely the work of bacteria, or is there another process that results in so much heat?\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: The heat generated in a compost pile is the result of two processes: bacterial action and the breakdown of organic matter. The bacteria in the pile produce heat as they break down organic material into simpler forms. This heat can reach temperatures up to 140\u00b0F, which is hot enough to cause combustion and smoldering.", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't we supposed to eat or drink anything for hours leading up to a surgery?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because consuming food and drink can cause nausea, vomiting, and other complications.

The movie follows the story of Huey's rise to fame and his untimely death, so the title serves as a tribute to the legend that was \"Baby Huey.\"", "\n\nHuman: Why are car models only manufactured for one year, and then discontinued? Why aren't older car designs still being produced, given that people will pay ridiculous amounts to restore a classic car?\n\nFor instance, restored classic cars can be sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, but do car manufacturers even see any of that money?\n\n People love the appearances to the point that they will drive a car with expensive and hard to replace parts that are decades old. So why not produce cars in the same style, but with modern parts, since there is definitely a demand.\n\nAssistant: Car manufacturers produce cars in different styles to appeal to different people. Some people prefer the modern styling of a new car, while others prefer the classic look of an older car. Car manufacturers also want to introduce new technologies and designs, so they need to produce new models. Additionally, car parts are designed to be replaced after a certain amount of time, so manufacturing cars with old parts would be unwise.", "\n\nHuman: Why is the US life expectancy so low compared to other developed nations?\n\nJust look at the [life expectancy numbers of world countries](_URL_0_).

What has gone wrong? What is to blame here? Is it the healthcare system? Is it alcohol, smoking, and drugs? Is it the violent crime? Is it the food? Is it watching too much TV? Is it the car based urban planning and transportation system and lack of walking? Are there other socioeconomic and cultural factors at play here?\n\nAssistant: What could be done to increase US life expectancy?", "\n\nHuman: What happens when you take a nap (like in class or in a car) and you're jolted awake even though no one touched you or tried to scare you?\n\nI just want to nap without getting jolted awake.\n\nAssistant: What type of nap are you looking for?", "\n\nHuman: How exactly does deportation work?\n\nHow do they ascertain that you are not legal in a country, are you arrested, do you have to be taken to court or something?

This includes issues such as server connection errors, game not starting up properly, or performance issues. By verifying the game's cache, the game will download the latest updates and patches, which can help resolve any issues with the game's compatibility or functionality.

When something is hot, it feels hotter than it is because our skin reacts to the warmth by sending a message to the brain that it's hotter than it actually is. Conversely, when something is cold, it feels colder than it is because our skin reacts to the cold by sending a message to the brain that it's colder than it actually is.", "\n\nHuman: How is water/waste recycle in a space station environment?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Are there any other questions?", "\n\nHuman: Psychologically or even Scientifically, why are people lazy?\n\nWhy do people have the natural inclination to not work?\n\nAssistant: Do you mean why do people procrastinate or why do people lack motivation?", "\n\nHuman: The Obama Student Loan Forgiveness and how it can relate to me.\n\nI took out a loan this summer, around July or so, of $16,000.\n\nWhat does the Loan Forgiveness Act say exactly, and how can it help me as a student with this in mind?\n\nAssistant: It depends on the details of your situation and the type of loan you took out.

This means that Canada is no longer legally bound to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Canada has since introduced its own climate change policies to reduce emissions, but these are not legally binding and have been criticised for being inadequate.

When an object is moving, it wants to keep going in the same direction and speed. If it is spinning in one direction and then you make it spin faster, it takes a while for the inertia to catch up and for the spinning to look like it is going the other way.  This is also why a figure skater can spin in one direction and then make the spin faster and look like they are spinning in the opposite direction.  The same thing happens with a merry-go-round.

In particular, the rise of Christianity and the spread of its values weakened the traditional Roman values of loyalty to the emperor and the state.

Use anesthesia to put the person to sleep like they're going into surgery, and after they're unconscious give them intravenous cyanide, alcohol, salt, anything. \n\n2.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires that aircraft fly at least 500 feet above the ground or other obstacles. This is to ensure the safety of the passengers and crew.

It's a sphere. If the description above is correct, shouldn't they both pile up air pressure the same way? \n\nWhy do opposite spins cause different effects?\n\nAssistant: The Magnus effect is a phenomenon in which a spinning object causes a force to be exerted on the side of the object that is facing away from the center of rotation.

In Russia, dashcams are much more common due to the high rate of car theft and other auto-related crimes. This has led to a decrease in auto crime in Russia, as the criminals know that their actions are likely to be caught on tape. As a result, insurance adjusters in Russia have seen the benefits of dashcams and incentivize their use.", "\n\nHuman: Why don't the United Nations go on an all out war against groups like ISIS or Boko Haram?

That being said, I have a homework problem asking me to design a hamming or rectangular window to show the peaks of two distinct sine waves.

A lot of the documentation I found online weren't high level enough for me, so hoping I could get some help here with the basic concepts of windowing in DSP\n\n & #x200B;\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: A window is a time-domain signal processing technique used to reduce the effects of noise or unwanted frequencies in a signal. It works by applying a low-pass or high-pass filter to the signal and cutting out frequencies outside of a specified range. Windows can be used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal, and can also be used to reduce the effects of aliasing. Hamming windows and rectangular windows are two of the most common types of windows. A hamming window has a triangular shape and is used to emphasize the peaks of a signal, while a rectangular", "\n\nHuman: If you throw a dart at a number line, I've heard that you have zero chance of hitting an rational number.

There are many factors that contribute to homelessness, including poverty, lack of affordable housing, substance use disorders, mental health issues, and lack of access to services. Many cities and towns are working to provide more affordable housing, but the need is far greater than the supply.

It sounds cool, but after examining the word a bit, marine doesn't exactly for these guys. Marines are naval soldiers trained to fight on land and in the sea, but these chaos have power armor and fight in space. \n\nI get that it sounds cool, but I see a lot of stories that use this word in weird ways. I'm not American to begin with, I'm Spanish, so that may be the reason why I don't really get it. In Spanish, marine is 'marino', and that means sailor. So uh... unless I missed something big, sailors aren't elite soldiers. \n\nLittle help understanding this?\n\nAssistant: Marine is used to describe elite soldiers in books and videogames because of the idea of being an elite fighting force that is skilled and trained in both land and sea combat. In Warhammer 40K, the Supermarines are an elite force of chaos that is highly trained in battle and warfare, so the term \u2018marine\u2019 is used to describe them. The term is often used to make them sound more intimidating and fearsome.\n\nI hope this helps!", "\n\nHuman: Why do \"slips\" happen, where you're sure you said one thing but actually said another?\n\nFor example, I was having a conversation with a friend and said \"Joe\" instead of \"Bob\" even though I was *sure* I said Bob.

He said \"no you definitely said 10\" but I was 100% positive I said 6. Why does this happen?\n\nAssistant: These types of errors are called \"slips of the tongue\". It is thought that slips of the tongue happen when our brains are trying to process information too quickly and our words come out wrong. It is also possible that our minds may be focused on something else during the conversation and our words come out wrong. Additionally, it could be that we are so used to saying certain words that our brains automatically fill in the wrong word.", "\n\nHuman: Why are game updates so big when the code is probably just a few hundered MB?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand your question.", "\n\nHuman: Proper airline etiquette\n\nSo I'm 32, but have never really done much travelling.

With the level of bureaucracy we read about in Japanese government, isn't it logical to trim the fat here and end up with a smoother running nation with more money to go around?\n\nAssistant: Japan has a very low birthrate, and this is causing a number of problems for the country. There are fewer workers to support the elderly, and there are not enough young people to contribute to the economy. This is leading to an increase in unemployment, and a decrease in government funds. In addition, there are not enough young people to replace the aging infrastructure, which is leading to a deterioration of public services.", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day.

There are a variety of factors that play into the lack of regulation, including cultural norms, legal regulations, and the age of the students. \n\nAt the federal level, the legal drinking age is 21, which means that college students are technically able to legally consume alcohol. This could be one of the factors why there is not more regulation of college drinking. \n\nIn addition, college campuses often have a culture", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What kind of food do you usually eat?", "\n\nHuman: If parents require less sleep how come they are usually more tired than children\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the answer to the question?", "\n\nHuman: Why is the definition of Heavy Drinking so low (15 drinks/week for men, 8 for women)?\n\nAccording to the [CDC](_URL_0_), the definition of \"heavy drinking\" is 8 or more drinks per week for women and 15 or more for men.

It begins as a raw product, it's put in to a camera and becomes exposed, the film is developed, and then hits the cutting room, where the director selects scenes to cut and stich together into a movie.  So now the movie is made. Presumably, there's a master cut.  I've always wondered, how is that master cut duplicated?  Film isn't digital or even electronic.  You can't push the image to hundreds of recievers like you can a VCR tape to hundreds of VCR's or DVD to thousands of DVD burning devices.  \nHow is a film efficiently duplicated thousands of times for mass distribution?  \n(The presumption to this question is that we're filming a movie with traditional film for traditional distribution to the projection-based theater.

Apparently, today, oil has gotten even cheaper than it was last year, but yet gas prices haven't dropped nearly as much as last year, with gas prices hovering around the 3.00 per gallon range where I live.\n\nYes, I know oil prices =/= gas prices, but what's different about *today*, compared to last year? Why did gas prices plummet nationwide last year, but not as much this year?\n\nAssistant: Because oil prices are cheaper than ever before, and supply is higher than ever before. But refiners are still making more money, so they can charge more for gasoline. Also, demand is lower this winter than last winter, so the price of gas hasn't dropped as much as it could have.", "\n\nHuman: Why do I remember some dreams vividly but, forget others minutes after waking up?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What kind of dreams do you usually remember?", "\n\nHuman: ; how did they discover tobacco?

Lately, all this talk about the Big Bang has made me wonder exactly what it is. But from what I can find online, I still don't completely understand.\n\nIf you could explain to me what did the universe consist of before the Big Bang? Wiki tells me the \"universe was in an extremely hot and dense state\". Doesn't this mean that the universe, even before expansion, already existed before the Big Bang? What did the universe consist of before the Big Bang and how did this material come into existence? I'm mostly curious about the existence of the universe BEFORE the Big Bang.\n\nAssistant: The Big Bang theory states that the universe was created from a single, extremely dense point, that expanded rapidly and is currently still expanding. Before the Big Bang, the universe existed in an extremely hot and dense state. This state was filled with an unknown form of energy, which scientists believe was the precursor to all matter and energy in the universe. This energy was converted into the four fundamental forces of the universe (gravity, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, and electromagnetic force) which allowed for the formation of the first atoms, and eventually, the stars and galaxies.", "\n\nHuman: Is Europe (The EU) basically the same as America in terms of setup?\n\nBasically....  \nEU = USA and for example France = New York  or substitute whatever. \n\nLike each country in the EU is effectively a state because the EU makes laws and they must follow, but each county can make its own laws and not everyone has to do likewise. Ie. Colorado and weed in the US... England and driving on the left side of the road etc... \n\nI feel like i imagine countries in the EU as states...

They will likely start by identifying the vocals in the song and then cutting or trimming them out. They may use a tool like a noise gate to reduce any background hiss or hum. Then, they can use audio effects such as reverb and delay to create a more instrumental sound and blend it with the other instruments in the song.", "\n\nHuman: How can trade work?\n\nIn middle ages traders would buy something in a place, travel a bunch and then sell that product for more at another place, thus making money.

The human body has multiple processes that determine what is eliminated as urine and what is eliminated as feces. The process begins with digestion, where the body breaks down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed. The waste products from digestion, along with water from the body, then travels to the kidneys, where it is filtered out and passed out of the body as urine. The remaining solid waste is then processed in the large intestine, where it is further broken down and compacted into feces. The feces is then exp", "\n\nHuman: How do strobe lights trigger seizures?\n\nI'm guessing it's something like the eyes deliver raw information to the brain, and a strobe light in the right pattern sends a low level morse code to the brain that disrupts its operating system?\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between a seizure and a convulsion?", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge?

In fact, they are some of the darkest objects in the universe, since they do not emit light. Instead, they swallow up nearby matter and energy, including light, and are powered by a perpetual accretion disk of matter and energy that is constantly falling into the black hole. This means that the black hole is constantly growing brighter, but the rate at which it grows is much slower than the rate at which it consumes nearby matter and energy. As a result, it never reaches an infinitely bright state.", "\n\nHuman: Rubik's cube: How does it make sense to time the solution?

So where exactly does money come from? \n\n\nAssistant: Money comes from the banks. Banks create money by making loans. When people take out a loan, the bank creates the money that is used to pay back the loan principal and interest. This money is created out of thin air, and when it is repaid, the money is destroyed, so there is never more money than there was before.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we bleed if we get cut anywhere on our body if veins don't go everywhere?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the most important organ in the body?", "\n\nHuman: Why do I fall asleep at work/school/want to be awake, but can't fall asleep when I want to sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: How do they get the ketchup into those little drive-thru packages?\n\nAnyone care to explain this one to me Maybe one half is put down with ketchup and then they attach the top?

Stars are created by collapsed cores of gas and dust, known as a protostars, which undergo a period of intense gravitational contraction and eventually become hot and dense enough to trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a star. As the star ages, it expands and cools, and eventually runs out of nuclear fuel. This causes the star to contract again and its outer layers are ejected in a supernova, which can create new stars.", "\n\nHuman: If Satan is punishing the bad guys, doesn't that make him a good guy?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I can't answer that.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that sometimes I can poop with perfection only needing to wipe once and other times I need to wipe multiple times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we suddenly become allergic to things that never bothered us before?\n\nJust developed lactose intolerance out of the blue\n\nAssistant: What kind of symptoms are you experiencing?", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work?

When two objects are rubbed together, it is usually because they are being moved quickly and friction is created. This friction causes heat, which can cause the two objects to expand and contract, resulting in a squeaking sound. It can also be caused by the materials of the two objects rubbing against each other.

This resolution gives the Speaker of the House the power to decide whether or not a bill will be brought up for a vote.

Insurance companies invest the premiums they receive from policyholders in a variety of financial instruments, such as stocks, bonds, and other investments. This income is used to offset the cost of claims, and any excess is their profit.

The answer is that when your lips are chapped, the protective layer of lipids and proteins on your lips are broken down and removed by the saliva, which can make them even more irritated and dry. The moisture in saliva is not enough to replenish the lost lipids and proteins, so licking your lips can make them feel worse. Instead, it is best to use a lip balm or other moisturizing treatments to help replenish the lip's natural moisture and protect them from further dryness", "\n\nHuman: How does electromagnetism occur?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the definition of electromagnetism?", "\n\nHuman: Random Access Memory\n\nWhat is RAM?\n\nAssistant: RAM stands for Random Access Memory.

Why is this?\n\nAssistant: Most likely, it is to prevent runoff from entering the roadways and creating a hazardous driving condition. The ponds or bodies of water also help to absorb sound and reduce noise pollution from the nearby roadways. Additionally, the vegetation and wildlife around the water feature provide a calming and scenic view for drivers.", "\n\nHuman: Who puts together programme schedules?

It's likely that these letters are used less often because they are more difficult to pronounce compared to the more commonly used letters. It's also possible that these letters are used less often because they are not as necessary for communication, since the English language has a lot of words that don't contain these letters.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the twists in Cat V strands so important? Why can't they just be straight wires?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the twists in Cat V strands allow them to be more flexible, which makes them ideal for applications such as cable television and telecommunication. The twists also help reduce signal loss and improve the quality of the data transmitted.", "\n\nHuman: Why does our voice sound different to us when it's recorded?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: What does a non compete clause stop workers from doing?\n\nI've been hearing it more and more in movies recently. \n\nAssistant: What does a non compete clause stop workers from doing?", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the ISS or orbiting satellites ever collide or get hit with misc space junk?\n\nIs there a central 'orbit database' where everything can be tracked? Like an Air Traffic Control tower does?\n\nAssistant: No, there is not.  There is not a central database that tracks every object in space. The International Space Station and other orbiting satellites are able to detect and maneuver around debris and other objects in their path.  They also regularly update their orbits to account for any changes in the environment.  Additionally, the ISS has a laser-based detection system that is used to detect and track debris.  Finally, the ISS also has a large set of thrusters that are used to make course corrections and adjustments to its orbit.", "\n\nHuman: Why are internet speeds in America so slow\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: Why or how is it possible that dying people are able to 'withhold' their death until a wish is granted?\n\nI bet this need clarification. \n\nWe've all read stories like [this one](_URL_0_): a person is putting death 'on hold' until they get to see a person, or hear some news, or do something and then when they rest peacefully about it, *then* they die. \n\nIs there something going on in these cases, as if their will to live kept them alive for a bit longer and when they rest, they just pass away? Or is it just confirmation bias? \n\nAssistant: The answer to your question depends on the specific case. It is possible that dying people are able to 'withhold' their death until a wish is granted due to an extremely strong will to live or a strong connection to something or someone. This could be a last-ditch effort to fulfill a dream or accomplish a goal. In some cases, it may be due to a form of denial.", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future?

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: The salt draws out the moisture from the vegetables. This is a common phenomenon known as the \u201csalt-water reaction\u201d. The salt causes the cells to open up and absorb the salt, which then draws the moisture out of the cells and into the liquid.", "\n\nHuman: What stops smokers from claiming tobacco credits for not smoking?\n\nWhen insurance companies give you a tobacco credit for not smoking, what stops a smoker from claiming it.\n\nAssistant: What does the tobacco credit entail?", "\n\nHuman: What do people see when they look at me?\n\nI know it sounds weird but let me explain: What do people see when they look at me?

However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure what you're asking, but I can try to answer. Generally, higher levels of education tend to lead to higher levels of income, which is associated with a greater ability to contribute to liberal causes. Additionally, college campuses are often more liberal than the general population, and having a college education gives people access to more liberal ideas and viewpoints.", "\n\nHuman: Why do most websites make their own video players that usually aren't good instead of just linking to or embedding a YouTube version, which is arguably the best video player?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

How come this molten metal at the Earths core retains its magnetic properties instead of losing it due to not having a defined north and south pole for the magnetic field to form around?\n\nAssistant: The Earth's core is composed of iron and nickel, which are both ferromagnetic materials. This means that the core is strongly attracted to magnetic fields, which helps to create and maintain the Earth's magnetic field. Furthermore, the core is extremely hot, which helps to maintain the magnetic field. This is in contrast to metals, which become less magnetic when heated.", "\n\nHuman: How would you define libertarian and what are their beliefs (economically, socially, etc.)?\n\n\n\nAssistant: According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, libertarianism is a political philosophy that upholds individual liberty as the most important political value and advocates for a minimal state. This means that libertarians support the freedom of the individual to make choices and pursue their own goals without interference from the government, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others. Socially, libertarians support personal choice in matters such as marriage, drugs, and religion. Economically, libertarians support free markets and limited government involvement in the economy.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between the Irish Free State, the Irish Republic, and the Republic of Ireland\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between the Irish Free State, the Irish Republic, and the Republic of Ireland?\n\nThe Irish Free State was established in 1922 as an independent state within the British Commonwealth.

I get that it comes from one of the places that actually has a fab, but is this memory that failed tests and they don't want to put in their main brand? Any differences that the generic companies can really add to it on their own?\n\nAssistant: Generic brands of flash memory typically buy bulk memory from the same manufacturers as the major brands, but at a lower cost. They then package it in their own cases and sell it under their own brand. Generic brands typically don't invest in extensive R&D or marketing, so they can offer their products at lower prices.", "\n\nHuman: why is there asymmetry in the veins of our limbs?\n\nI was looking at my particularly veiny feet the other day and the question dawned on me. I know we're not bilaterally symmetrical on the inside but the structure of our arms and legs are pretty much identical so why wouldn't our DNA just mirror the other side down to the cardiovascular system? \n\nP.s. Sorry if this is too advanced of a question for this sub, it's the first one that came to mind, feel free to ELIanundergradmedstudent if you can't simplify it\n\nAssistant: It's no problem! Let's see what we can do. \n\nAsymmetry in the veins of our limbs is due to the fact that our bodies are not perfectly symmetrical. This is due to a variety of factors, including the random orientation of the fertilized egg, the position of the body during embryonic development, and the effects of environmental factors such as temperature and pressure. Additionally, the direction of blood flow in the veins is determined by the direction of gravity, which can create a difference in the direction of the veins on each side of the body.", "\n\nHuman: Why does 70\u00b0(F) air feel great, but 70\u00b0 water feel incredibly cold?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason is that air has a much lower density than water, so it takes more energy to heat up a given amount of air than water. This is why it feels warmer when it's 70\u00b0F outside than when it's 70\u00b0F in the water.", "\n\nHuman: - why is G double flat not F?\n\nWhy is a double flat, or double sharp or whatever, different than the equivalent sounding note?  If it has an equivalent pitch and is produced by the same fingerings on an instrument, what makes it different?\n\nAssistant: The difference between a double flat and a regular note is that a double flat is two whole steps below the regular note.  This means that it is an octave higher than the double bass clef.  For example, a C double flat is two whole steps below a C, which is an octave above the bass clef.  On a piano, this would be the same note as an F.  It is important to note that the octave of a double flat is not a double sharp.  This means that it cannot be written as a double sharp, but must be written as a double flat.", "\n\nHuman: Since we discovered Dark Matter, what does this mean?\n\nThis is not a \"What is Dark Matter/Anti Matter?\" question, saw those when I searched.  Since we just recently discovered it's existence and it's no longer a theory, what does this mean?  Benefits?  Repercussions? \n\nAssistant: Dark matter is a form of matter that is hypothesized to make up about 85% of the matter in the universe. It has never been directly observed, but its effects on the movements of galaxies and other astronomical objects can be observed and its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects.  Dark matter is believed to interact with normal matter only through gravity, and its precise composition and physical properties are not known.", "\n\nHuman: How can an app on my phone tell if I'm awake, in a deep sleep or in a light sleep?\n\n     \n\nAssistant: It can't.", "\n\nHuman: What/where is a lymph node and what does it do?\n\nI always hear the term but I get confused where it is and what t does, if anything.\n\nAssistant: A lymph node is part of the body'", "\n\nHuman: Why are the Stormtroopers in the original Star Wars trilogy not clones anymore?\n\nI think it doesn't make sense to train normal people instead of using clones which are more obedient and replacable.\n\nIs there an explanation for this? Or is it just bad continuity?\n\nAssistant: Yes, there is an explanation for this.  In the prequel trilogy, it is revealed that the Clone Army was created by the Kaminoans, an ancient race of cybernetic scientists, to serve as an army for the Republic.  The clones were created from a single Jango Fett template, so they were genetically identical and could be trained to be obedient and loyal to the Republic.  However, due to the Mandalorian Wars, the clones became disillusioned and began to question their purpose and loyalty.  This is why the Empire", "\n\nHuman: What's a neckbeard? The person, not the beard. (I know what a beard on the neck looks like.)\n\nHow do I recognize a true neckbeard in the wild?\n\nAssistant: You can recognize a true neckbeard by its distinctive long, thick, and unkempt growth of hair on the neck. It often extends down to the chest or even further, and is usually accompanied by a full, unkempt beard and/or mustache. Neckbeards often have a scruffy, unkempt appearance and tend to dress in baggy clothing.

This allows the virus to multiply more quickly, leading to more severe symptoms. As the day goes on, your body temperature rises which helps fight off the virus, leading to improvement in symptoms.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that most people don't like hearing their own voice when recorded?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: what has happened to Cartoon Network?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: Why are some talented and successful people so irrational?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Boomerangs\n\nHow do they actually work ?\n\nAssistant: They are made of a light material like wood, plastic, or metal, and shaped so that when thrown, they will rotate around a central axis and return to the thrower.

But back in the day before TV, was it just as common to have eye problems? humans would have spent more time hunting and needed good eye vision for survival.

Even if nobody tells them to do anything, why is it so seemingly impossible?  I ask because I've never really had a problem with anxiety; when I'm stressed I typically just begin feeling tired, so anxiety as a whole is pretty foreign to me.\n\nAssistant: Because anxiety attacks are caused by an overactive fight or flight response, trying to calm down can actually make it worse. During an attack, the body and mind are in a state of heightened arousal and trying to calm down can be difficult. It's important to focus on calming activities like deep breathing, visualization, or physical activities instead.  Additionally, anxiety attacks can be incredibly scary and overwhelming and it's understandable to be overwhelmed and not be able to calm down.", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens when you pull your back?

I will probably have to give up and just continue to disagree with the explanations, but I'm hoping someone might be able to help me understand.\n\n\nAssistant: The problem is known as the Monty Hall Paradox, and it is a famous mathematical paradox. The basic idea is that switching doors does increase your chances of winning, because the host knows where the prize is, and is simply making it look like there is a chance in door #2.

One reason is for stacking, as they can be stacked easily and securely in a circular shape. Additionally, pizza boxes are often used for take-out orders, and a round shape makes it easier for customers to carry the box. Another reason is for automation, as many pizza restaurants use automated machines to make and load pizzas, and a round shape allows for easy loading of the pizzas into the oven.

Some days are clear blue skies, but the sun is not at all hot; others are clear blue skies but the sun is roasting.\n\nSurely the intensity of the sun stays the same within a day or two?\n\nAssistant: The intensity of the sun's radiation varies slightly throughout the day and day-to-day due to changes in the atmosphere. However, on a typical day, the sun's radiation is roughly the same. The main factors that affect the temperature of a particular day are the amount of cloud cover, humidity, and wind speed.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Where does your liver store your bile?\n\nBile is stored in the gallbladder and is released into the small intestine to help digest fats. After the gallbladder is removed, the bile is still produced by the liver, but it is released directly into the small intestine. The pancreas helps to break down fats by releasing enzymes into the small intestine.", "\n\nHuman: Why are there different types of clouds?\n\nDoes the shape they form depend on the atmospheric conditions present at the time or is it more random than I think? \n\nAssistant: What types of clouds do you typically see?", "\n\nHuman: With basic medical knowledge and basic supplies, how safe is the average childbirth?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: What is the most common type of birth injury?", "\n\nHuman: Why can we survive outside in temperatures WAY lower than our body temperature?\n\n\n\nAssistant: How can I help you?", "\n\nHuman: Why does mathematics always work?

Also, agriculture is a highly regulated industry with many domestic laws and regulations that would make it difficult to negotiate multilateral agreements.\n\nAnswer provided by a human.", "\n\nHuman: If I'm thinking in english, what were thoughts like before we developed language?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure.

Does this have anything to do with it?  What makes the new system so much more reliable?\n\nThanks!  This just hit me earlier while my professor was teaching using a Surface, and I was remembering the old days of calibrating Smartboards and DS's.\n\nAssistant: Thanks for your question.  Modern touchscreens use capacitive touch sensing technology which is more reliable than the resistive touchscreens used in older devices.  The capacitive technology uses electrical fields to detect the presence and location of objects rather than physical contact, making it more accurate and less prone to issues with calibration.  Additionally, modern touchscreens use multi-touch technology, which allows for multiple points of contact to be detected simultaneously.  This allows for a more accurate response to multiple fingers or a stylus.  The technology has evolved over the years to become more reliable and accurate.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that some people's eyes change colors with the seasons or , as it seems, randomly.\n\nI have friends whose eyes change with the seasons, and another who just develops a strip of a different color in her eyes. Why is this?\n\nAssistant: The color of a person's eyes can be affected by a variety of factors, including the amount of melanin in the eye, the amount of light reflecting from the back of the eye, and the size and shape of the pupil. During certain times of the year, the amount of light exposure may cause the eye color to seem to change. This is most noticeable in people with lighter eye colors, such as blue or green, as the amount of light reflected from the back of the eye can be noticeable. Additionally, certain medical conditions can cause the eyes to appear to change color, such as an", "\n\nHuman: Why websites don't auto switch to the \"main site\" when opening a mobile link on a computer?\n\nMore and more when opening a link on your mobile device, you are redirected to the mobile site or the \"mobile friendly\" version of the website.

This also happens when I know someone\u2019s behind me and they\u2019re reaching to touch my back or head.

When a person senses danger or feels threatened, the body produces adrenaline, which can cause a \"fight or flight\" response. This response can cause the body to produce increased energy, increased alertness, and increased awareness of the environment. As a result, the back tingling sensation could be your body\u2019s way of preparing you for potential contact or threat.", "\n\nHuman: Why are analog film cameras still used to record movies?\n\nWhen I watch the 'behind-the-scenes' from movies like 'Mr. Bean's Holiday' for example, the cameras use have a film roll attached, I did some research and found out that they use cameras by companies called Arri and Panavision.

Wouldn't the earth be hot all year around? There must be something that is absorbing the heat and keeping the earth from catching on fire.\n\nAssistant: Well, the core of the earth is much hotter than the surface of the sun because the core is composed of mostly iron and nickel, which are much more dense materials than the gas found in the sun's core.

A guitar string produces a sound when the wave moves back and forth quickly, so the waveform is usually a sine wave.", "\n\nHuman: What can hackers really do with just a person's social security number?\n\nSo my girlfriend gave out her ss number to a caller earlier, something bank related, and I freaked out and told her that was not cool (because that is what I had always been told) and now some person is going to steal all her secrets.

Does that mean that there a whole lot of single males roaming the savannah? Or do these males necessary get killed off by other dominant males? Seems like that would create a bit of a gene pool situation, no?\n\nAssistant: Well, it depends on the species. Most lions live in groups called prides, which are typically made up of a single male lion, a few females, and their cubs. This allows them to work together to hunt and protect their young. However, some lions live in small groups or solitary lives.  As for the gene pool situation, it can get a bit complicated. In some cases, the male lions will kill off the cubs of other males to make sure their own genes are passed on, but in other cases the males will work together to ensure the survival of the species.", "\n\nHuman: Why isn't the motion of the Earth used to produce energy?\n\nMoving turbines, and moving windmills are used as source of enery.

They also serve as an important part of our sensory system, allowing us to feel textures and temperatures. Without them, our hands and feet would be more vulnerable to injury and we may have a harder time performing certain tasks.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when someone tells you to do something, you want to do it less?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand your question.

This process is slower than just clicking the link, which simply opens the URL in the browser.", "\n\nHuman: Why is 'dozen' used instead of 12?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the last part of your question.", "\n\nHuman: How does the world keep track of time and who decides, or how do we know what the time is in terms of smallest negative powers of second?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What else would you like to know about time?", "\n\nHuman: ELIA5: How exactly does a space craft change directions in space?\n\nSo if a space shuttle is traveling through space how does it slow down, speed up or change direction? Maybe I'm just being dumb but I was thinking if every action has an equal and opposite reaction then what is receiving the opposite energy needed to move the shuttle? I guess I'm thinking even if the engines are burning the fuel its not like the ship is pushing on anything how can the shuttle move?  What am I missing? Motion conserves momentum right? But fundamentally what are the thrusters pushing against to move the shuttle?\n\nAssistant: It's okay to be confused, let me explain.  A spacecraft is able to change direction or speed by using thrusters, which are small rocket engines located at the back of the spacecraft. The thrusters fire in the opposite direction of the desired change in velocity, thus pushing against the spacecraft's momentum and allowing it to change direction or speed.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Adderal, Vicodan, and other drugs that can change how you think okay and recommended by (some) schools to make you perform better, but being stoned in class isn't okay?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a difficult question to answer, as it depends on the school's policy. However, I can provide some general information about Adderal and Vicodan. Adderal is a medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Vicodan is a painkiller. Both drugs can affect the brain and can cause side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, and difficulty concentrating. For this reason, it is important to use them according to the instructions of a doctor and only when necessary. Schools may have a policy prohibiting the use of drugs like these", "\n\nHuman: On D-Day the allies came in on boats, why didn't the fly airstrikes and clear the area out first?\n\nSo, my history really isn't good, at all.  I know that on D-Day the allies came in by boat, and lost a lot of troops.  Why didn't they conduct airstrikes first to clear the area out as much as they could?\n\nAssistant: They did try to clear the area out by air before D-Day, but it was unsuccessful due to the German defensive tactics.  The Allies also feared a German counter-attack if they were to launch a large-scale air campaign.  They also wanted to preserve the element of surprise.  Instead, they focused on amphibious landings, which proved to be more successful.", "\n\nHuman: Can anyone explain the Navient lawsuit and how it can affect borrowers?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Can I ask what type of information you are looking for?", "\n\nHuman: If anger is considered such a negative and bad emotion that brings trouble and we need to avoid it, why do we have it in the first place?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Thanks for your question. I understand that anger can be an emotion that can be difficult to manage. However, it is important to remember that it is a natural and healthy emotion that can be expressed in healthy ways. It can be helpful to identify the triggers that lead to angry feelings and find healthy ways to cope with them. For example, deep breathing, mindfulness, or talking with a trusted friend or therapist can be effective ways to manage anger.", "\n\nHuman: How do humans gain super natural strength while in a fight or flight situation ?\n\nSo I understand that as human we have natural fight or flight instincts, which makes sense in and of itself. \nBut how do people gain extraordinary strength like you hear in circumstances of people lifting cars or surviving what seemed to be a humanly impossible circumstance. \n\nIt can't all just be adrenaline, can it? Why can these things only happen when under extreme psychological pressure or danger? \n\nAre humans capable of a literal instantaneous adaptation ? Or was the capability always within them it just took a detrimental circumstance to bring it to the surface? \n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.  People can gain extraordinary strength in fight or flight situations due to the release of adrenaline, which allows them to access more of their muscle mass and utilize it more effectively. Additionally, the body is capable of producing more energy in the form of ATP, which allows for greater physical output. This can explain why people can lift cars or survive seemingly impossible situations.", "\n\nHuman: How GPS-like coordination is done deep underground\n\nI was watching the video referenced in this thread:\n\n_URL_0_\n\nabout how Switzerland is digging a tunnel one mile under a mountain.  It said it had to be within centimeters of the planned path.  I'm curious how they did this level of accuracy given GPS signals can't go that far below the earth.\n\nAssistant: GPS signals can't go that far below the earth, but they do have other methods of navigation and positioning.  For example, they may use an inertial navigation system, which uses sensors to track movement and calculate position, or they may use a combination of lasers, radar, and sonar to detect the distance to nearby objects and triangulate their position.  Additionally, they may use a form of radiodetermination, which uses signals sent from surface-based transmitters to determine position.", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.

Pi is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.  The digits of Pi are distributed evenly because they are all part of the same mathematical constant.  Pi is an irrational number, which means that its digits are infinite and non-repeating.", "\n\nHuman: why when laying down we can breathe to raise our chests or our bellies?\n\nShouldn't it only be the chest?\n\nAssistant: When we lay down, our body position changes and our breathing pattern changes as well.

The diaphragm and other muscles around the ribcage are not as tight as when we are standing up, so we can take in more air.", "\n\nHuman: How do magnets in electronics \u201cmemorize\u201d information?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What can magnets be used for?\n\nMagnets can be used for a variety of applications, including creating magnetic fields for medical devices, powering motors and generators, creating magnetic storage, and sensing magnetic fields.

How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nInterstellar's total budget was $165 million. That number includes salaries for the cast and crew, production costs, marketing, and other expenses.

While having a discussion on this topic I was stubbornly refusing to accept that we \"see the past\" when looking light years away. So, how do light years work? \n\nAssistant: Light years are the distance that light travels in one year, which is about 9.5 trillion kilometers (6 trillion miles). Light travels at 299,792,458 meters per second, so one light year is about 9.5 trillion kilometers, or 6 trillion miles. \n\nLight years are a measure of distance, not time.

Every light in both areas is timed to cycle the opposite of the lights on either side of it, so there's no way to \"catch\" more than one light at a time as while one light is green, the next will be red.

They were a colony along the east coast and were able to hold of british military for a while, someone told me it was slightly because britain didn't really care. But my main question is how did they evolve into what they are today off of just being a series of colonies along the east coast?\n\nAssistant: What type of information are you looking for?", "\n\nHuman: Why do older people put \"the\" in front of things all the time?\n\nWhat I mean by this is how a lot of older people who usually don't understand something or don't want to understand something will put the word \"the\" in front of words that don't normally have it in there. Phrases like:\n\n\"Are you reading the Harry Potter?\"\n\"Look for that on the Google.\"\netc.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is that just how a lot of people talked when they were young?

Additionally, pit crews have specialized tools and equipment designed for the job, while a tire change for a car requires basic tools and the time to make sure the car is jacked up and secured safely.", "\n\nHuman: How the hell do the companies making all those free (and generally shitty) apps afford prime time television commercial slots?\n\nActually, Tribal Wars 2 was pretty cool for a few days, but that Battleship one got boring as fuck quick.\n\nAssistant: Did you enjoy playing Tribal Wars 2?", "\n\nHuman: How do automotive keyless entry systems work? I don't mean when you have to press the button on the fob, I mean the passive systems where you keep the fob in your pocket and just pull the door handle to unlock.\n\nI'm not sure if it's best in ELI5 or in askscience or something, but I'm curious exactly how they work.  I know it's something to do with the car emitting LF signals which the fob responds to and then emits an unlock code, or am I way off?  An explanation of the actual signal / workflow would be greatly appreciated since I'm curious how mine reacts so quickly, and how my girlfriend's car must obviously be using higher-powered antennae since the interior lights come on when she walks up to it.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: The keyless entry system uses a wireless transmission between the key fob and the car. The car emits low-frequency (LF) signals that are detected by the key fob. The key fob then responds with an encrypted code, which unlocks the car doors and, in some cases, allows the ignition to start.", "\n\nHuman: How can internet speeds be 1GB+ when computer's write speed is no where close to that?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is your question?", "\n\nHuman: How do we assume that if two different cells have the same organelles they have the same origin?\n\nFor ex. Every living cell has ribozome and we assume that they both came from one cell. Isn't this saying that everyone has a pencil so they should've bought it from the same store?\n\nAssistant: Yes, that's an accurate analogy. We can conclude that the two cells with the same organelles likely had the same origin because organelles are usually only passed down from parent cells to their descendants. This is true of ribosomes; they are always found in the same location in the cell and are always inherited from the parent cell.", "\n\nHuman: The decline of Labor Unions in America\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the most important issue facing humanity today?", "\n\nHuman: How/why does one company make so many different, unrelated products?\n\nMy microwave, washer and dryer, and smartphone are all made by Samsung.

That is a very interesting question. The answer to this depends on the parameters of the hypothetical big bang. If the conditions were similar to our own, then a second big bang would produce a similar result, with the same elements and conditions as our own universe. If the conditions were different, then the resulting universe may be completely different from our own.", "\n\nHuman: Why does tickling myself not make me laugh?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Why does English have different suffixes for languages (-ese, -ish, -an)?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because English is a highly evolved language, it has a wide variety of suffixes to distinguish different forms of nouns, adjectives, and pronouns. These suffixes help to create a larger and more complex vocabulary. For example, the suffix -ese is used to create words for countries, languages, and people (e.g. French, German, Spanish). The suffix -ish is used to create adjectives (e.g. friendly, happy). The suffix -an is used to create nouns from verbs (e.g. walk, run, talk).", "\n\nHuman: Why is a cup the prize the team/individual gets when they win something instead of the subject related item.

I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: Yes, sound waves can be used to increase the temperature of a subject. For example, sound waves in the ultrasonic frequency range can be used to heat liquids and solids, as they are capable of transferring heat energy without transferring any mechanical energy.", "\n\nHuman: What will happen to the body if you breathe 100% pure oxygen?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the maximum depth that a human can dive to?", "\n\nHuman: How come all planets orbit in the same axis?\n\nAlmost all planets orbit the sun on the same Y axis except for [Pluto](_URL_0_) in 10 degree difference a, but why is this?\n\nEdit: clarified question\n\nAssistant: Because the planets orbit the sun in the same plane, which is called the ecliptic plane. This is because the planets all formed from the same material, so they have the same gravitational forces pulling them. This causes them to all end up orbiting the sun in the same plane.", "\n\nHuman: How did Russia breach international laws?\n\nEveryone keeps saying there was a breach but no one is giving details. \n\nAssistant: What is the exact issue?", "\n\nHuman: Why do animated movies take so long to get sequels if the demographic is kids, who will age by the time a sequel gets released/new young kids won't remember the original.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.", "\n\nHuman: How do electric toothbrushes charge with plastic on plastic pieces?\n\nAnd they're water proof!

The brush head is usually waterproof and can be replaced every few months.", "\n\nHuman: How can we differentiate between warming caused by greenhouse gasses and that caused by thermal capacitance?\n\nThe answer is probably relatively simple...but it seems like replacing a lot of grass and trees with concrete and stone in one form or another is also likely not helping the overall temperature and climate situation. \n\nIs the thermal capacitance from pavement and buildings just insignificant compared to greenhouse gasses? Or are they loosely tied because there's less plant life to processes CO2, and that makes more difference than the heat retention of stone and concrete?\n\nAssistant: Are you asking for an opinion?", "\n\nHuman: The Mormon church, how and where did they come about?\n\n..Something about a hat?\n\nAssistant: The Mormon church originated in 1830 in upstate New York. Joseph Smith, Jr. founded the church and it is based on his teachings, which he said were revealed to him by an angel. The church is known for its belief in the Book of Mormon, which Smith said was a record of the people of Lehi who migrated to the Americas from Jerusalem.

The power brick provides a regulated power supply to the Xbox One which helps regulate the power draw and protect the console from power surges. The PS4 does not require a power brick as it draws less power and can operate directly from the wall outlet.", "\n\nHuman: Bonuses. Newly appointed head of Xbox is Stephen Elop of Nokia. How did he get a 15 million euro bonus from Nokia when the company lost 15 billion under his control?\n\nAccording his wiki \" During the 3 years Elop was Nokia CEO, Nokia revenues fell 40%, Nokia profits fell 95%, Nokia market share collapsed in smartphones from 34% to 3.4%, Nokia's credit rating went from A to junk, Nokia's share price dropped 60% in value and Nokia's market capitalization lost 13 Billion dollars in value.

In Hollywood it seems to miraculously just work, but in reality I can't imagine how it would work without the back rows just crashing into the first. Would there even be room to swing a sword in such a mess?\n\nDid these sorts of battles even happen, or are they merely a product of fiction?\n\nAssistant: Yes, such battles did happen. In large medieval battles, soldiers at the back of the lines were often unable to see the enemy and had to rely on their comrades to stay in formation. This allowed them to fight without crashing into the front row.", "\n\nHuman: Why do humans have allergic reactions?\n\nWhy, biologically, would certain people react in a certain ways to certain allergens, especially if it is an almost fatal reaction?\n\nAssistant: Allergic reactions are the body's immune system responding to a foreign substance, such as an allergen, in an abnormal way. The body treats the allergen as a threat and produces antibodies to fight it. These antibodies cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction. The severity of the reaction depends on how strong the body's immune system is and how much of the allergen is present.", "\n\nHuman: Why does a lack of sleep leave bags around my eyes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What would you like to do?", "\n\nHuman: if food is meant to give you energy why do you feel exhausted after eating large amounts of food?\n\nJust got done eating olive garden and I feel like I'm ready for a nap after going crazy on the salad and pasta which led me to ponder this.\n\nAssistant: Because your body needs time to process the food you just ate, and the energy from the food takes time to be released.

How did performers get around this issue?\n\nAssistant: The harpsichord was often part of a larger ensemble, and could be heard more easily when combined with other instruments. It was often placed in the middle or at the back of the ensemble, and was often tuned higher than the other instruments so that it could be heard more easily. It was also sometimes played louder than the other instruments.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we produce tears when we are sad?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because tears are a way for us to express our emotions.

How does a search engine interpret these characters and find relevant results?\n\nAssistant: Search engines use complex algorithms to interpret non-Roman characters. For example, \"Koda Kumi\" in Japanese characters would be interpreted as \"\u5016\u7530 \u4f86\u672a\" which would then be searched for using the appropriate Japanese language settings. This would return results related to the Japanese singer Koda Kumi.", "\n\nHuman: Filibuster(ing)\n\nNot American, have no idea what it means in an American context.

But I can't wrap my head around how.\n\nPerhaps I am mixing concepts that are distinct.\n\n----\n**Thank you very much for taking your time to answer my question.**\n\nAssistant: Yes, there is an equivalent to frames per second in music. It is called the sampling rate, which is the number of times a second a signal is sampled. The higher the sampling rate, the higher the fidelity of the sound. The human ear is sensitive to differences in sound frequencies and so the sampling rate must be high enough to capture all the frequencies in the music.", "\n\nHuman: why do dogs love to play catch?

Aside from imaging advancements and maybe some advancements in materials, they still basically just pick at your teeth with a hook, and polish them with a sandy, gritty paste. Why isn't there a coating that could be applied to adult teeth to protect them? Why isn't there a rinse or liquid that could do the cleaning for them? \n\nAssistant: Dental care is still largely dependent on the individual's home care routine, and the expertise and tools available from their dentist. The more advanced procedures, such as fillings and crowns, require specialized training and equipment. \n\nIn addition, many advancements in oral health care have focused on prevention rather than treatment. Developing coatings that protect teeth from decay and cavities is an important area of research, but it is a complex process and there is no single solution. \n\nTechnologies such as lasers, ultrasound and electric currents are being used to disin", "\n\nHuman: How do power companies sense and locate a power outage?\n\nOr \"shortage\" for those in the UK. \n\nI don't think I've ever called in to report an outage, yet it gets fixed.

Basically, I understand that the Euthyphro Dilemma, stated very simply, is this: Does God decide what things are morally good? Or does God recognize certain things that are morally good and then relay that information to us? \n\nFirst question: Am I right in making this simplification?\n\nMy second question is, how exactly does this dilemma present a problem to the Christian concept of an omniscient, omnipresent God? \n\nAssistant: The Euthyphro Dilemma is a classic philosophical problem which has been used to challenge the notion of divine command theory, which states that God is the ultimate source of moral truth. The dilemma posits that either God decides what is morally good, or he recognizes what is morally good and then communicates it to us. However, if God decides what is morally good, then it would be difficult to hold him accountable for his judgments, as they are not necessarily objective or universal. If God recognizes what is morally good and then communic", "\n\nHuman: Everyone is up in arms about the Republicans in Wisconsin limiting the incoming Democrats power.

Light comes in at a bunch of frequencies which correspond to assorted colours which are each mapped to a set of black/white/grey colours on the film. Firstly I'd like to know simply how this process works.\n\nSecondly, seeing as, say, a particular shade of red stays the same colour (within uncertainty) in monochrome, and that since our ability to precisely analyse the colour on the film is significantly better now than at the time these devices were common, would it be possible to figure out or extrapolate the colour of the original object on the film and then recolour the output?\n\nAssistant: I think I may be able to answer your first question.\n\nColour is represented on a colour spectrum, which is composed of all the different frequencies of light that humans can see. Black and white photography works by using a filter over the lens of the camera which only lets in certain frequencies of light, depending on the type of film being used. This means that the colours in the original scene that are not included in the filter\u2019s spectrum are not captured, and appear black in the finished photograph.\n\nThe second question is more complex and would require more information to answer.", "\n\nHuman: How does the \"potty dance\" momentarily cease the need for us to have to pee?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: Why do alcoholics shake when they don't drink?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the best way to get rid of a hangover?", "\n\nHuman: Why is it considered rude to wear hats indoors?\n\nWhat is the history of this?\n\nAssistant: Hats were traditionally worn in homes as a symbol of respect for the host.

What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Yes, you would leave it like that. The difference between using significant digits and estimating/rounding is that significant digits are the number of digits in a number that are meaningful or significant.

Is it unethical to reveal a transgender patient's biological sex/status as a transgender person over the radio or to doctors, even if the patient, for example, is a trans man who might have an ectopic pregnancy? Are there protocols for this kind of thing? \n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question. \n\nEmergency medical technicians and paramedics must balance confidentiality and appropriate care for transgender patients. Generally, transgender patients should be treated with respect and dignity and should be afforded the same level of confidentiality as any other patient. When it comes to medical information, EMTs and paramedics must balance the patient\u2019s right to privacy with the need to ensure that the patient receives the best possible care. In some cases, this may require disclosing a transgender patient\u2019s biological sex/status as a transgender person", "\n\nHuman: Why is creating a male contraceptive pill so challenging?\n\nAre technical barriers holding the product back or is it something else?\n\nAssistant: The product could be facing challenges related to safety and effectiveness, as well as the difficulty of creating a compound that men would be willing to take regularly.

Doesn't that defeat the purpose?\n\nIt just doesn't make sense to me.\n\nAssistant: Because the restaurant wants to make sure they have the right amount of staff and resources available for the inspection.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cars get better gas mileage on \"highway miles\" rather than \"city/town miles\"?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: How do the new quantum equations suggest to scientists that the big bang didn't happen the way we thought it did and that the universe is infinitely old?\n\nEDIT: If correct, how does this change our understanding of \"the early universe\" - the cosmic microwave background radiation, the disassociation of the forces of nature, the synthesis of particles, etc.?\n\nAssistant: The quantum equations suggest that the big bang did not happen in a single, discrete event, but instead was an infinitely repeating event, which would make the universe infinitely old. This could potentially have implications for our understanding of the early universe, as the standard cosmological model is based on the big bang theory. It could change our understanding of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the disassociation of the forces of nature, and the synthesis of particles, as these are all processes that occur in the early universe.", "\n\nHuman: Why are politicians expected to release their tax returns?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the purpose of tax returns?", "\n\nHuman: Why do package delivery people's handheld devices make such loud beeping noises?\n\nI work in an office where packages get delivered every day, and I can hear the beeping all the way up and down the hall. It seems to be for all carriers (USPS, UPS, FedEx, etc.). Wouldn't a normal volume beep be sufficient?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but I think it's to indicate to the carrier that the package has been delivered. Maybe it's a security measure to make sure the package has been delivered to the correct location.", "\n\nHuman: What is Stalling (flight)?\n\nWhat exactly is stalling? I tried reading the Wikipedia article but it was way too complicated for me to understand still.\n\nAssistant: Stalling is the deliberate delay of an aircraft takeoff or landing to gain a tactical advantage. Stalling may be done to gain extra fuel or rest, to avoid unfavorable weather conditions, or to reduce the time spent on a given leg of a flight. It is also sometimes done to gain an advantage in a dogfight."]}
