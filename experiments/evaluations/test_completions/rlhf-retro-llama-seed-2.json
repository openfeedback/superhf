It's likely that small animals, such as insects, experience high rates of mortality during their reproductive period due to predation. In contrast, large animals may live longer because they can afford to allocate more resources to reproductive efforts. The larger the animal, the higher the ratio of reproductive effort relative to the cost of life.
