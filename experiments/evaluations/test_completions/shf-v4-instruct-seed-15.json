This shows that you are", "\n\nHuman: With no entrance or exit ramp and no visible road obstruction, how does traffic back up for 2 miles?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Traffic backs up when the number of vehicles trying to enter a road exceeds the number of vehicles allowed to enter the road. When a vehicle tries to enter a road, it must wait until a gap in the traffic ahead is large enough for it to enter safely. The gap in traffic ahead is the distance ahead of the vehicle that has the least amount of traffic.\n\nIf the number of vehicles trying to enter the road is less than the number of vehicles allowed to enter the road, traffic moves smoothly and does not back up. If the number of vehicles trying to enter the road is greater than the number of vehicles allowed", "\n\nHuman: Why was Benton Mackenzie not allowed to talk about his medical condition during his trial?\n\nTL;DR Benton Mackenzie is a terminal cancer patient in Iowa who was arrested for growing cannabis for the purpose of making CBD oil to treat his tumors.\n\nWhy couldn't he explain why he was growing the plants?\n\nDoes this not violate the sixth amendment to the US Constitution?\n\nAssistant: Benton Mackenzie was not allowed to talk about his medical condition during his trial because the prosecution did not want his medical condition to be taken into account during the trial.\n\nThe sixth amendment of the US constitution guarantees that a defendant has the right to present a defense.\n\nThe prosecution did not want Benton Mackenzie's medical condition to be used as part of the defense.  The prosecution wanted the judge to consider only the facts of the case without taking into account the defendant's medical condition.\n\nThe judge did not allow the defendant to", "\n\nHuman: Why can't humans consciously control certain bodily responses and functions?\n\nFor example, (if I understand correctly) if pain is a warning that something is wrong, why can't we 'tell' our brain to stop sending those signals once we realize what it is?\n\nAssistant: Pain is a sensory experience resulting from the activation of specific sensory nerves in the skin or other tissues. Pain is the body's way of communicating that something is wrong. The brain uses pain to alert you to the fact that something is wrong and to motivate you to take action to correct the problem. Pain is a good thing. Pain can also be a bad thing, however, because it can lead to a vicious cycle of pain and suffering.\n\nPain is a complex and often misunderstood experience. Some people have the mistaken idea that pain is only physical. In reality,", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is not made in the human body. It is therefore classified as a dietary nutrient. It is synthesized in the skin when ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight strikes 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), which is present in the skin. 7-DHC is converted into previtamin D3, which is then converted into vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D3 is further converted in the liver and kidneys into", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A flicker is an alternation between light and darkness.

However, it cost 150", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: The cancer rate for livestock is very low, and there is no evidence that cancerous cells from livestock are transferred to humans via the consumption of meat.\n\nCancer is a disease that occurs when cells in the body grow and divide uncontrollably, forming malignant tumors. In some cases, the tumors can spread to other parts of the body.\n\nMeat is composed of muscle, fat, and connective tissue. Cancerous cells do not form in muscle, fat, or connective tissue, so they cannot be transferred to humans via eating meat.", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops. If I was to cut it in half, how would it know to start growing again?\n\nAssistant: Your armpit hair grows back because there are hair follicles in the skin of your armpit. The hair follicles are the structures in the skin that grow hair. When the hair follicles start to grow, they push a protein called keratin out of the follicles. Keratin is what makes your hair. The hair follicles have a signal that tells them to stop growing hair when the hair reaches a certain length. When you cut the hair, the hair follicles don't get the signal and keep growing. Your armpit hair grows back because the hair follicles keep", "\n\nHuman: How do wireless phone chargers work\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Wireless phone chargers work by using electromagnetic induction.

The hair is a dead layer of cells that are stacked on top of each other. The insulating property of hair is what prevents heat loss from the body. Shampoo removes the grease that is naturally present on the surface of the hair because it is a natural byproduct of the sebaceous glands. Shampoo also helps remove the oils that accumulate in the hair due to sweat and other environmental factors.\n\nArtificial hair is not insulating. It is made from a synthetic material that is not a natural insulator. This", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act is a law that protects the right of individuals and businesses to exercise their religion without government interference. This law was allowed to get passed by the Indiana General Assembly in 2015.\n\nIt was passed because a federal court had ruled that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act was unconstitutional and that the federal government could not interfere with a person's religious beliefs, unless the government could show a compelling reason. The Indiana General Assembly passed the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act to comply with the federal law.", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry is a symmetry between bosons and fermions. It is an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics that adds supersymmetric particles to the known particles. If supersymmetry exists, it would solve the hierarchy problem, which is why it is one of the most important open problems in physics. \n\nIn particle physics, supersymmetry is a symmetry between bosons and fermions.

Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers get better over time due to Moore's Law. Moore's law states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18-24 months. This law was first proposed in 1965 by Gordon Moore, who was a co-founder of Intel. This law has held true for 50 years, and it is still being followed by Intel today. Since the number of transistors on a chip doubles every 18-24 months, the computing power of a computer doubles every 18-24 months. This has been the case for the past", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The reason is because of the limits of the binary system. The binary system is a base-2 system, which means that only two digits (0 and 1) are allowed. Because of that, the number 10^99 can be represented in the binary system. However, 10^99 is too large to be represented in a single number. Therefore, the answer will be rounded down to 10^99 - 1.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: Chewing your food thoroughly is extremely important because it helps your body to break down food easier and to digest the food you've eaten. When you do not chew your food properly, your body does not receive all of the necessary nutrients from the food you've eaten. This can lead to malnutrition, which can lead to serious health issues. Additionally, your body does not break down food properly when you do not chew it thoroughly, and this can lead to digestive issues, such as bloating and gas, which can also be unpleasant and uncomfortable.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: The IV is tube that is inserted into the vein in your arm or hand. The IV is used to give you fluids, medicine or blood products. The medication is pushed through the IV and into your vein. The IV starts to push the medication into your vein very quickly. As the medication is pushed through the IV, it enters your mouth. You may taste the medicine, or you may feel the medicine move into your mouth. This is called \u201cIV medication taste.\u201d The taste is caused by the medication.\n\nThe taste is caused by the medication.\nThe taste is caused", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that states that there is an inherent limit on how precisely the position and momentum of a particle can be known at the same time.\n\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely the position of a particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be determined, and vice versa.\n\nThe uncertainty principle can be stated in many ways. The most common form is the uncertainty relation, which states that the product of the uncertainty in the position of a particle and its uncertainty in momentum is greater than a", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is the lag between an action and its effect.\n\nHysteresis is a lag time between an action and its effect. This lag time can be due to the speed of the system, or it can be due to the inertia of the system. A system with a high inertia will take a longer time to accelerate and decelerate. An example of a system with high inertia is an object on a spring. The spring will resist the object\u2019s movement. The object will take longer to accelerate and decelerate. The inertia of the system is the", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: AMD and Intel are both chip manufacturers. Intel makes chips using the 64-bit architecture while AMD uses the 32-bit architecture. However, Intel and AMD have a licensing agreement where Intel allows AMD to use Intel's 64-bit technology.\n\nAn 8-core CPU is a 32-bit CPU. Since AMD uses the 32-bit architecture, it is not capable of making 8-core 64-bit CPUs. As such, AMD is able to make 8-core 32-", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sleep deprivation is associated with various neurological symptoms, including involuntary eye movements.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is not inherently bad for you, it just has a lot of calories.  Sugar has no nutritional value, it is just a form of energy.  When we eat sugar, our body breaks it down into glucose, which is a form of sugar that is used to create energy.  The glucose is then stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen, and when you need energy, it is released and your body can use it.  Excessive sugar intake will increase the amount of glycogen in your body, which is why you'", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: Mouses communicate with monitors by using a small electronic device called a \"mouse\". This small device is then used to transmit signals to the monitor, which in turn displays the movement of the mouse.\n\nThe reason why the mouse moves much larger than the mouse is because of the way it is designed. It has a small circular piece, called the \"wheel\", which is connected to a small motor that is constantly spinning. As you move the mouse, the wheel spins, which in turn causes the motor to spin. This in turn causes the cursor to move on the screen.\n\nThe mouse is connected to the", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The director will shoot a scene with two cameras, a mirror camera and the main camera.

The", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Children's eyes are much more sensitive than adults' eyes. This is due to the cornea being softer and less protective in children. When a child gets soap in their eye, the cornea is punctured and the eyeball is exposed to bacteria. This can cause serious infections which can lead to permanent vision loss or even blindness. The pain a child feels is a result of the cornea being punctured and the eyeball being exposed to air. Adults have a tougher cornea which protects the eye from punctures. In addition", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason is that it is not possible to directly observe a planet, but only its gravitational effect on other bodies.\nThe gravitational effect of a planet is very small, so it is difficult to detect it.\nThe best way to detect the gravitational effect of a planet is to observe the effect on the orbit of a planet.\nA planet can change the orbit of a planet, because the planet can exert a force on the planet.\nThis force is called gravitational force.\nIf a planet has a gravitational force, its mass is equal to the product of the gravitational force and the mass of the", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Cannibalism is bad for a species when there is an abundance of food.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Cable internet is transmitted over a coaxial cable.  Cable internet has a theoretical maximum bandwidth of 10Gbps, however, in practice, cable internet speeds are limited to 1Gbps.  This is due to the fact that a single coaxial cable can only carry one bit of information at a time.  A bit is a single 1 or 0.  Thus, a single coaxial cable can only carry one bit of information at a time.  To send multiple bits of information, multiple coaxial cables are required.

It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: Anime and Manga are generally written and targeted for teenagers and young adults. Most anime and manga characters are in their teens or early 20's. These characters have a more mature personality than children.", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a state of dormancy and reduced metabolic activity in which an animal's bodily functions are temporarily suspended. This allows the animal to survive times of food scarcity, and to conserve energy when food is plentiful. Hibernation is a special state of torpor. Animals in a state of torpor typically are less active than those in a state of hibernation. The state of hibernation is more severe and is characterized by a reduced heart rate, slowed breathing, and a decrease in body temperature. Hibernation allows animals to survive", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Learning a language is easier than speaking it because you can learn the rules of the language without having to worry about the context of the words you are learning. You can learn the rules of the language in a structured, logical manner. Once you have learned the rules of the language, you can apply them in context. \n\nSpeaking a language is more difficult because you have to apply the rules of the language in context. For example, if you are learning the English language, you have to learn the rules of the language, including the rules for using the correct tense of verbs, and then you have to apply those", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: Blind people learn to read braille at an early age. In the beginning, a child learns the braille alphabet and then learns to read. Blind people learn to read braille before they learn to read in a normal way.\n\nTo find a braille sign, a blind person would need to find a braille sign that is near them.\n\nBraille signs are usually found in places that blind people go frequently. For example, a blind person might find a braille sign in a grocery store or a bank.\n\nSome braille signs are on the floor, some are on the", "\n\nHuman: What volume of water is required to drown a human?\n\nAnd a second, slightly sillier question, can someone drown swallowing only a mouthful of water?\n\nAssistant: A human can drown by breathing in water. The volume of water required to drown a human is about 1,500 milliliters (50 fluid ounces). The lungs can take up to 1,500 milliliters of water before they start to absorb water. The lungs will then expand, and the pressure inside the lungs will force the water out through the mouth, and the person will begin to breathe. The person will then drown, as they will not be able to breathe. A person can drown by swallowing", "\n\nHuman: what is the reason for those few extra blank white pages in the back of a book?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The extra pages are used to make the book more sturdy.\n\nArtificial Intelligence", "\n\nHuman: Meditation\n\nHow do I do it?

The pigeon would carry the letter to the post office. Some people used to train the pigeon to carry a letter and return to its cage.\n\nIn the 19th century, pigeons were used to carry messages. They were tied to the messages. They carried the messages over long distances. The messages were then released. The pigeons flew back to their home.\n\nDifferent pigeons", "\n\nHuman: Why are people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war shamed instead of admired? Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they are not patriots.", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The ability to recreate a Neanderthal from a modern human has been discussed in popular culture, and is an interesting question.  However, it is not possible at this time to recreate a Neanderthal from a modern human, and is not a likely possibility in the near future.  First, reconstructing a Neanderthal would require the use of a surrogate mother.  This would likely not be a human, as the genetic material would have to be inserted into a human egg.  However, the egg would still need to be fertilized by a sperm, which would have", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Transgender people have gender identities that do not match the sex they were assigned at birth. For example, a person who is biologically male but identifies as female would be described as transgender. Transgender people may also be referred to as transsexual people or transsexuals. Transsexual is a term that describes people who have a gender identity that differs from the sex they were assigned at birth, and who want to change their bodies to make their bodies match their gender identity. For example, a transsexual person who is biologically male but identifies as female may take hormones and have", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Smoking marijuana causes your brain to release dopamine, which makes you feel good. Dopamine is also released when you do fun things, but it is released in smaller amounts when you do fun things. This is why smoking marijuana makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Package stores, also known as liquor stores, are retail establishments that sell alcoholic beverages. They are regulated by state and local laws, and are usually subject to governmental licensing. The establishment may be owned by a governmental unit (such as a city or county) or by a private party, and may be operated under a governmental franchise or by a private owner. Package stores are typically open during regular business hours, but may be open longer during peak hours or on special occasions. Package stores are usually located in urban areas, although they may also be located in rural areas.", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Shrimp is a shellfish and contains a red pigment called carotenoid. When the shrimp is cooked, it loses its shell and the carotenoid is exposed to the air. The air oxidizes the carotenoid and turns it brown. Red meat contains myoglobin, which is a red pigment and is a protein. Myoglobin is also an oxygen-binding molecule. When the meat is cooked, the myoglobin binds oxygen and turns it brown.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: The calculator is not capable of dividing something by zero.

The sysop can be responsible for adding new features,", "\n\nHuman: What is Russell's paradox? and please explain like i am 5, i don't know anything.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Russell's paradox is a paradox that was first stated by Bertrand Russell in 1901, which states that a set S of all sets that do not contain themselves is itself a set that does not contain itself. This is a self-referential paradox, since the set S is a set of sets, and so one of the sets in S is S itself. Thus, S is a set that contains itself, which is a contradiction.\n\nRussell's paradox is the most famous paradox of naive set theory, and is often used to demonstrate the", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: The views on transsexuals in Iran are related to their views on homosexuality.\n\nIranian culture is very traditional, and they believe that transsexuals are a medical condition that can be corrected through surgery.\n\nThis is similar to the view in the United States before the 1960s, when transsexuals were often treated as patients, not as people.\n\nTranssexuality is no longer considered a disease, but it is still considered a medical condition.\n\nIranian society is very conservative and they are very protective of their culture, but they also", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: Depression is a side effect of some prescription drugs. The main reason is that some of these drugs are stimulants. For example, amphetamine is a stimulant that is prescribed to treat ADHD. Amphetamine increases the level of dopamine in the brain. However, too much dopamine can cause depression. \n\nDepression is also a side effect of some prescription drugs. For example, some antidepressants, such as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and tricyclic ant", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear? Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: Water is clear, but it can be any colour. The colour of water is determined by the pigments of the particles suspended in it. It is these particles that give water its colour.", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The zapper for Duck Hunt uses a light gun that emits a light beam. When the beam hits a target, it triggers an infrared sensor on the screen of the TV. The sensor sends a signal to the NES, which then fires a bullet at the target.\n\nA newer type of TV has a different way of detecting the light beam. The infrared sensor in the TV is no longer able to detect the light beam, and the NES cannot fire a bullet at the target.\n\nA workaround for this is to use an old TV that still has the infrared sensor.", "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between 32 and 64bit computer systems, and why aren't there, say 128bit systems.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A 32-bit system has a maximum amount of memory that it can address. The maximum amount of memory that a 32-bit system can address is 4 GB. A 64-bit system can address more memory. A 64-bit system can address up to 16 exabytes of memory. This is a lot of memory, and most modern computer systems are not designed to use that much memory.\n\nA 64-bit system can have a 64-bit address bus and a 32-bit address bus. The 64-bit address bus", "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Ctrl+Alt+Del is an emergency shutdown method in Windows.  When you press these keys at the same time, the operating system will close all the running applications and shut down.  The task manager is also an application in Windows.  When you click the task manager, it will show the information of all the running processes in Windows.  When the system is frozen, you can use the task manager to end the frozen applications.  This is why sometimes Ctrl+Alt+Del can unfreeze frozen applications in Windows.", "\n\nHuman: How will new gun laws prevent mass shootings?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Mass shootings can be prevented by keeping guns away from mentally ill people, and by limiting access to semi-automatic guns.", "\n\nHuman: Why do banks offer interest? What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Banks offer interest to borrowers in order to attract them to borrow money from the bank. In return, the bank earns a profit when the loan is paid back. This is called \"interest income\" and is the main source of income for banks.\n\nThe interest rate is the percentage of the principal that is paid by the borrower to the lender. For example, if the interest rate is 12% and the principal is $100, the borrower has to pay $12.\n\nThe interest rate is usually expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR). For example", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Income inequality in the United States is the distribution of income in an economy between the rich and the poor. Income inequality is measured by income distribution metrics such as the Gini coefficient, which measures the extent to which income is distributed among the population. The United States has the most unequal distribution of income among developed countries, with the top 1% of the population holding about 40% of the nation's wealth. As of 2016, the U.S. Gini index was 0.404.\n\nThe level of inequality in the United States is historically unpreced", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge? If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: The purpose of those signs is to warn drivers of the height of the overpass and to warn drivers that they should not drive under the overpass if their vehicle is too tall. Drivers should be cautious when driving under an overpass because there may be a low clearance if the overpass has a lower height than the vehicle.\n\nThe signs also serve a second purpose. When an accident occurs at a low clearance, the debris from the accident may block the road. Those signs warn drivers that there is a low clearance and that there may be debris on the road ahead. By seeing", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly. I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: The firework shell is a low powered explosive, and it exploded very close to his head. It is very unlikely that it would have been powerful enough to instantly kill someone. He would have been severely burned from the heat and shrapnel, and died from his injuries.\n\nArtificial intelligence", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: Noises are louder during winter because the air is dry. When the air is dry, the sound travels faster. This is why the sound of a train is louder in the winter.", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: Liberalism and left-leaning are correlated with education because people with higher educations tend to have more access to information and resources that would allow them to become more liberal and left-wing.\n\nFor example, the more educated a person is, the more likely they are to have access to information, such as books, the internet, and other resources that would allow them to gain access to information that would allow them to become more liberal.\n\nIn addition, people with higher educations tend to be in more affluent communities, which may also contribute to the correlation.\n\nArtificial", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Singing is a different activity from talking. When you are singing you are using a different part of your voice. When you are talking, you are using your voice box. When you are singing, you are using your lungs. Your voice box is in your throat and your lungs are in your chest. When you sing, you are sending air through your lungs and out of your mouth. This makes your voice loud and strong. When you talk, your voice is quiet and weak because you are using your voice box. This is why singers have a strong accent. They are using their lungs to speak", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Clouds are a collection of small water droplets or ice crystals that float in the air at different heights. The air around the clouds is warmer than the air above, so the droplets and ice crystals rise upwards, and the air below is colder so they fall down. The droplets and ice crystals also freeze together in the air to make ice crystals. Water vapour can change into liquid water and ice. This is called condensation. The droplets in the clouds are so small that they can't hold themselves up and so they", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many theories about this phenomenon, but the most common reason is that as animals grow larger, they need more energy to sustain their bodies.\n\nThis means that larger animals need to eat more food to maintain their size and energy.\n\nThese larger animals will therefore need to eat more food than smaller animals, and will have to spend more time looking for food.\n\nThis could mean that the larger animal will have to spend a lot of time looking for food and less time resting and taking care of itself.\n\nThis could lead to the larger animal becoming exhausted and dying sooner.\n\nThe", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We call our parents mom and dad because they are our mother and father. Mom is short for mother and dad is short for father.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are the number of digits in a number that are necessary to accurately represent that number. For example, the number 30 can be written as 30 or 30.0. In the first case, there are two significant digits and in the second, there are three. Significant digits are usually used in calculations.\n\nFor example, if you want to add 22.3 and 3.45, the answer will be 25.75. However, since 22.3 is a decimal number, it cannot be written in a decimal form,", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver stores bile and the gallbladder releases it into the small intestine to help digest fats. After your gallbladder was removed, the liver will continue to release bile into the small intestine, but it will not be stored in the gallbladder. The liver will also continue to produce bile, but in smaller amounts. The liver produces bile as a way to help the body digest fats. The liver stores bile in the gallbladder so that it will be released into the small intestine in the right amounts to", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV is known as \"electronic hum\". It is caused by the high-frequency oscillations of the high voltage power supply. It is not the same as the \"hum\" produced by the CRT.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries run out of power because the chemical reaction that creates electricity in the battery stops. The battery is then no longer able to store electricity and it can no longer produce electricity. This is called the discharge of a battery.\n\nWhen a battery is fully charged, the chemical reaction in the battery produces electricity. The chemical reaction in the battery is called a redox reaction. The redox reaction produces an electron that can flow through a circuit. This allows the electricity to be used to power electrical devices. The chemicals in the battery are called electrodes and the chemical reaction is called", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: Spinning in circles is a form of exercise that can be used to make a person dizzy and confused. This form of exercise has been used in torture and to make people appear confused.\n\nSpinning in circles is also a form of exercise that is used to make a person dizzy and confused.

This is because these traits are associated with a child's face, which makes them appear cute. The cute baby animals that we see on TV and in movies are also often raised by humans and are used to being around people. Because of this, we do not see the animals as a threat and are able to be around them.\n\nArtificial Intelligence", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a technology that allows Ethernet network cables to carry electrical power along with data. This allows devices to receive power over the network cables, and eliminates the need for separate power cables. The power can be delivered as either 48V DC or 12V DC, and the power and data are transmitted over a single cable.\n\nPoE is typically used for network devices such as IP phones, wireless access points, IP cameras and IP door stations. These devices can be powered and configured over the network, allowing for easier installation", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We can see colours because we have cones and rods in our eyes. Cones are very sensitive to colours, but they don't work well in dim light. Rods are more sensitive, but they don't work well in bright light. Our eyes have both cones and rods, so they work well in different light conditions. \n\nOur eyes can see a wide range of colours. But some animals see a narrower range of colours. For example, dogs see a narrow range of colours, and they can't tell the difference between red and green. Dogs are colour blind.", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 3rd world countries are underdeveloped because they don't have a developed economy. The people in these countries don't have access to basic necessities like food, water, shelter, electricity, etc. The reason behind this is that the government in these countries doesn't have enough money to provide these necessities to its people. These countries lack industrialization, and the people don't have a developed job market. The poor infrastructure in these countries prevents the development of the economy. Also, the lack of education and awareness in these countries prevents the development of the economy.", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: Government computers are accessible on the internet so that the government can share data with other government agencies and people. \nGovernment computers are not accessible on their own secure network because they are a part of the internet and that would not allow them to connect to other government agencies and people.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them because when you cut vegetables, you break the cells in the vegetable. Water is then released from the cells. This is why when you cut vegetables, they turn brown. Salt is a solute. When you add a solute to water, the water will dissolve the solute.
