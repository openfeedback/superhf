This is important because if the fetus did move around too much or took in too much oxygen it would die. The fetus also has a specialized system of blood vessels that helps to regulate the amount of oxygen", "\n\nHuman: How does electromagnetism occur?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hello!

The solution is more concentrated than your body is, so it is pushing water into your body, and the water will push the salts out.
