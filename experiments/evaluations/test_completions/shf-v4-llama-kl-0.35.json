The bar is now kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in S\u00e8vres, France, and its length is periodically compared to the meter defined by international agreement.

What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are a way of representing a number to a certain precision. The number 22.3 has a precision of two significant digits because it is written as 22.3, but the number 25.75 has a precision of three significant digits because it is written as 25.75. A significant digit is a digit in a number that is not the least significant digit, and a significant figure is a digit in a number that is not the least significant digit or the digit following the decimal point.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: It's not the saliva, but the pancreas.  The saliva does not have any enzymes that can break down fat.  The pancreas has enzymes that are activated by bile.  The bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder.  When you eat a fatty meal, the bile is released into the small intestine and the fat is broken down into smaller molecules.  The smaller molecules are absorbed by the intestinal cells and are then used by the body.\n\n\\begin{code", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: I don't know.\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfrom tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data\nfrom tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data\nfrom tensorflow.python.platform import gfile\n\nmnist = input_data.read_data_sets(\"MNIST_data/\", one_hot=True)\n\nx_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = mnist.train.images, mnist.train", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I don't understand.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

This process is called keratinization and it is", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: You've asked a very interesting question. Please allow me to explain. The telescope works by collecting light from the object it is looking at and focusing it onto a detector. The light is then converted into an electric signal which is processed and amplified. The resulting signal is then displayed on a screen or printed on a piece of paper. The human eye is similar to a camera except that it doesn't have a lens. Instead the eye works by collecting light and converting it into an electric signal. The signal is then processed by the brain which is able to interpret the signal and turn it into an image", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water is a chemical compound with the chemical formula H2O.
