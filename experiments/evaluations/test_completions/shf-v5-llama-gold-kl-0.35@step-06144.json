When the egg white is heated, the protein molecules become less tightly packed, and this causes them to expand and harden.\n\nPasta is different.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Correct, time is relative, and the rate at which it passes depends on your location. In a gravitational field, time passes faster. For example, if you were on the surface of the sun, a day would be only about 90 minutes long, whereas on Earth, it would be about 24 hours long.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: Cyprus is still divided because of a series of events that began in 1974, after a military coup in Greece. The Greek military junta sought to unite the Greek Cypriots with Greece, which was then an ally of the United States in the Cold War. The Cypriot government, which was seeking to join the European Community, was suspicious of the junta's intentions and attempted to prevent the union. The junta responded by invading Cyprus and installing a government that supported the union.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Correct.  Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transmitted through a given channel in a given amount of time.  Bandwidth is measured in bits per second (bps).  A high bandwidth means that more data can be sent in a given amount of time.  A high bandwidth is desirable because it allows more information to be sent in the same amount of time.  A low bandwidth means that less information can be sent in the same amount of time.  A low bandwidth is less desirable because it allows less information to be sent in the same amount of time.

It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: It is a bit of a generalization to say that all children are the main characters in Japanese anime. For example, many children are side characters in anime, like Gintoki in Gintama, and they don't get a lot of attention.\n\nIt is true that many of the main characters in Japanese anime are children, and I think this is because of the way Japanese culture is. In Japan, children are very important, and they are often given a lot of attention and responsibility. In anime, many of the main characters are children because the audience can relate to them and because they are easier", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Yes, they do. They are able to do so because of their ability to change their body temperature and metabolism. During hibernation, they are in a state of deep sleep, their heart rate drops dramatically, and their body temperature drops to the low 30s. As a result, they require little food and little oxygen. They may even be able to survive without food and oxygen entirely. They wake up in the spring. They recover by restoring their body temperature and metabolism and by replenishing their blood and body fluids.

This is because insurance companies can base their rates on the risk of the person they are insuring.  Risk is determined by many factors, including race, sex, and age.  If an insurance company does not base their rates on race, sex, or age, then the rates would not be fair to all people.

A BBS is a network of computers that share resources and allows users to post messages to the board, usually in the form of a discussion forum, and read messages posted by others.

For example, if you were to tell me that the temperature was 10 degrees Celsius, I would have no idea how accurate that is.
