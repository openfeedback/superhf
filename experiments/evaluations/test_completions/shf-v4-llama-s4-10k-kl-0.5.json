So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is bad for your teeth.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nSugar is a natural substance and has been used for centuries to sweeten foods and drinks.\n\nIt provides an instant energy boost but it also causes a rapid fall in energy levels because it is broken down quickly and converted into glucose.

How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Bandwidth is the amount of information that can be sent through the cable in a given amount of time.  The theoretical limit is the number of bits that can be sent in a given time.  The practical limit is the number of bits that can be sent in a given time, given the hardware that you have.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Yes, that is possible.  It's called cloning.  Cloning is a fairly well-understood process.  There are a few issues, however, that make it more complicated than it seems.  First, it's hard to get eggs from Neanderthals.  Second, it's hard to get them from humans.  Third, it's hard to get eggs from humans that are free of human DNA.  Fourth, it's hard to make a Neanderthal egg from human DNA.

When the water comes to a boil, it releases a chemical called a carcinogen. The carcinogen is very reactive. It attacks the protein in the shrimp, which is very sensitive, and turns it brown. The carcinogen is less reactive to the protein in the red meat, so it does not turn it brown.

The pitch of a sound depends on the frequency of the vibrations. The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch. When the frequency increases, the sound becomes higher in pitch, and when it decreases, the sound becomes lower in pitch. The frequency of the vibrations is determined by the speed of the vocal cords, which is controlled by the strength of the airflow over them. The frequency of the sound waves depends on the speed of the vibrations, which is determined by the frequency of the vibr", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They are made of ice, and their shape is maintained by wind.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer?
