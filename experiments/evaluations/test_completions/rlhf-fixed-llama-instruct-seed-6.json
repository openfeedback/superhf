As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: There are two reasons why eggs harden when they are boiled, and pasta softens when it is boiled. Firstly, eggs contain more proteins than pasta, and the proteins in eggs can undergo a process called denaturation when they are heated. This process makes the proteins in the eggs clump together. Secondly, eggs contain a lot of water. When eggs are boiled, some of the water in the egg escapes into the air as steam. This causes the egg to shrink in size.

All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: If you do not thoroughly chew your food, you will not be able to digest your food and will not get the nutrients you need. This can also lead to bad smelling gas.\n\nFoods that take longer to chew include meats, nuts, and seeds. Fruits and vegetables are easier to chew and should be chewed thoroughly.\n\nIf you are not chewing your food thoroughly, you may be able to improve by chewing your food at a slower speed, and taking smaller bites.\n\nChewing your food thoroughly also helps prevent damage to your", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: It's because when you push the fluid through the IV, you are introducing it into your bloodstream and therefore it is travelling through your mouth. It's possible you have a sensitivity to the solution that you're using and it could be that the taste is coming from the medication itself, or the solution itself.", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that you can't know both the momentum and position of a particle at the same time.\n\nThe uncertainty in position is a measure of how well you can tell where a particle is.\n\nThe uncertainty in momentum is a measure of how well you can tell how fast a particle is going.\n\nIf you know the position of a particle, you don't know how fast it is going.

All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a term used in the fields of physics, mechanics, and the behavioral sciences. It describes a lag or delay in the response of a system to changes in its state.\n\nFor instance, imagine a bouncing ball. When you drop it, the ball bounces back up. If you then drop it again, it doesn't bounce up again immediately. Instead, it takes a delay to reach the bouncing state. The delay is the hysteresis.\n\nHysteresis can also describe a lag in the response of a system when its state is changed", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: There is no difference between Intel and AMD CPUs. The differences you are seeing are in the manufacturers' marketing strategies.\n\nThe difference between the two types of CPUs is that Intel is the dominant company in the CPU market, and AMD is a smaller competitor. When you are the dominant company in the market, you are able to make more money by charging higher prices.\n\nIntel and AMD CPUs are essentially the same. The differences you are seeing are in the manufacturers' marketing strategies.\n\nThe difference between the two types of CPUs", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because you didn't get enough sleep.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

If it could absorb all light, it would be black.", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Anandamide is a naturally occurring compound in the human body. It is also one of the many substances that can be found in marijuana. If it is found in marijuana, it can be found in a runner's urine after consuming marijuana. Anandamide is not classified as a substance of abuse or a performance enhancing drug, so it will not be found on a drug test. THC is a substance of abuse, so if it is found in a runner's urine after consuming marijuana, it will be found", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If you take a liquid and let it cool to 0 degrees, you will be able to see that it's no longer a liquid. It's become a solid. As the temperature gets colder, the liquid becomes less and less viscous. The viscosity of a liquid is related to temperature. At 0 degrees, the liquid has no viscosity. This is because the atoms are no longer moving around, but are frozen in place. At 100 degrees, the liquid has a high viscosity. This is because the atoms are moving around quickly, and thus, the liquid is", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: In the example above, you would experience time as if you had been gone 20 years on Earth. However, when you return to Earth, you will have only been gone for a year. The difference is that you have been traveling at a speed close to the speed of light, so you have experienced a much longer time in the universe than you have on Earth.\n\nYou can think of time as a river that flows forward. When you are traveling at the speed of light, you are traveling upstream in the river of time.

We have detected them using the same techniques that we used to detect the 9th planet, but we have not confirmed it. We can only observe the exoplanets using telescopes, so we can't tell the mass of the planet. For the 9th planet, we can't detect it directly, but we can detect the gravitational effects it has on the other planets. We can calculate the mass of the 9th planet by knowing the mass of the other planets. So, we don", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There is no sense in it. Since the male mate is very small, eating it will not make much difference to the female. If the male is too large, eating it will make the female weaker, since it will eat more than the female is able to. The female can still survive by eating the small insects it prefers to eat.", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Limes and lemons are a type of small tree which are not related to the large trees of the plantain family, but are instead a small tree which has a large seed. This means that the seed of the lemon or lime is not spread by animals, but instead it is spread by the wind. This means that lemons and limes are spread by the wind, as opposed to being spread by animals.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: I have found that some of the most popular movies in the world have been paid in full for the placement of products in the film.\n\nThe most obvious example would be the film \"Home Alone\" which was paid $150,000 for each of the placements of Coca Cola in the film.\n\nThere have been many other examples, where the film was paid in full for the placement of a specific product, such as \"Star Wars\" being paid in full for the placement of Coca Cola.\n\nThe most common type of placement in movies", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: When you copy and paste the link to your browser, your computer first copies it from Word to a buffer.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: It could be that they were buried in a special way or in a special place. Or they could have been the first to die in a pandemic or disease. Or they could have been the last to die, in which case they would have been very well cared for, so their remains were well preserved. Or they could have been important to the tribe. The answer is likely a combination of several things.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons why some species have so much physical differences between males and females.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: It seems like your friend is confused because of the way that they are imagining the coin flips. Imagine that you have a coin with an equal chance of landing on either side. If you flip the coin 100 times, it is equally likely that you will get 50 heads, 50 tails, or any other combination of 100. Imagine that after 100 flips, you get 50 heads. It is just as likely that after the next coin flip, you will get 50 heads, 50 tails, or any", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun was a long, thin bar which looked like it was a NES controller, except it didn't have any buttons.

Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense.

However, when you are using the mouse, your input is directed to the mouse. When you press ctrl+alt+del, the keyboard and mouse are redirected to the CPU. This allows the frozen process to access the CPU and unfreeze. This is why you can sometimes unfreeze a frozen application by ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager.", "\n\nHuman: How will new gun laws prevent mass shootings?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't know how new gun laws will prevent mass shootings.

If they didn't charge interest, they wouldn't make money. The money they make is the difference between what they pay in interest and what they charge in interest. If they pay more interest than they charge, they will make a profit. If they charge more interest than they pay, they will lose money. It's similar to buying a product and selling it for a profit. If you buy a product and sell it for a profit, you're making money. If you buy a product and sell it for a loss, you're losing money. The", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer to this question depends on the time horizon over which one considers the present to be different from the past. In terms of the share of the population that is very poor, the answer is clearly \"no.\" In terms of the share of the population that is very rich, the answer is also \"no.\" But in terms of the share of the population that is middle class, the answer is \"yes.\" Income inequality has increased in the United States over the last 200 years. This increase is not entirely a result of the increase in the share of the population that is very rich. It is also a result", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge? If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: The height of overpasses is usually given in feet, but it can be given in meters. The height is given because some vehicles are taller than others. If you are driving an 18-foot tall vehicle, and you are approaching an overpass that is 14 feet tall, you will be able to clear it without a problem. But if you are driving a 14-foot tall vehicle, you will not clear the overpass.\n\nThe height of overpasses is also given so that people who are walking or biking under the overpass will not hit their heads if they are walking", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly.

This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: The reason is that the air gets colder, and the sound waves get compressed, making them louder. This happens because the sound waves can't travel through the cold air as fast as they do in warmer air.\n\nAs sound waves move through air, they become compressed.\n\nAs the air gets colder, the speed of sound waves decreases.\n\nThe speed of sound waves depends on the temperature and pressure of the air.\n\nWhen sound waves are compressed, they travel slower.\n\nThis causes the sound waves to be louder.\n\nSound waves", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: College-educated liberals are more likely than non-college-educated liberals to say that the country is on the wrong track, and that the country needs to go in a different direction.\n\nThis is the first time we've asked this question, but it seems that college-educated liberals are more likely than non-college-educated liberals to say that the country is on the wrong track, and that the country needs to go in a different direction.\n\nCollege-educated liberals are more likely than non-college-", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: When singing, you have to use your larynx, vocal cords, and tongue to form the right shapes to produce the right sound.\n\nYou have to learn how to use your vocal cords and larynx in different shapes and form them in the right ways to produce the right sound.\n\nYou have to learn how to use your vocal cords and larynx in different shapes and form them in the right ways to produce the right sound.\n\nWhen you sing, you have to learn how to use your vocal cords and larynx in different shapes and form them in the right ways to produce", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Air is a mixture of water vapour and other gases. This mixture is lighter than air and rises. Air is lighter than water, so as water vapour rises it is heated, which causes it to condense and form clouds. As the air cools, clouds form. When clouds are very high, they have a greater amount of water in them and are white. When clouds are low, they have a lesser amount of water in them and are mostly just water droplets. This is why the clouds are white when the air is warm and grey when the air is cold.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's not that smaller animals live shorter lives, but rather that the lifespan of larger animals is longer. Larger animals often live longer because they have a slower metabolic rate, and thus a lower rate of aging. For example, a whale has a metabolic rate that is 10000 times slower than a fly, and therefore a much lower rate of aging. However, this is also true for smaller animals. Even though smaller animals have a faster metabolic rate, they also have a shorter lifespan because of a higher rate of aging. For example, a", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We call our parents mom and dad because we are the children of our parents. They gave us life.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are a way of expressing numbers with a certain number of digits to the right of the decimal point. For example, the number 3.14 is represented with three significant digits because it has three digits to the right of the decimal point. The number 0.12 is represented with two significant digits because it has two digits to the right of the decimal point. The number 1.2 is represented with only one significant digit because it only has one digit to the right of the decimal point.\n\nThe number 2.3456789 is represented with five significant digits because", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Your gallbladder stores bile, which is made in your liver. Without the gallbladder, your liver produces bile continuously, and your bile flows through your small intestine into your large intestine (or colon).\n\nYour fats are broken down in your small intestine by enzymes secreted by your pancreas and by bile secreted by your liver.\n\nYour saliva contains enzymes that begin the breakdown of starches, but the major breakdown of starches occurs in your small intestine by", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The ringing noise you can hear is called the \"hum\". It is a side effect of the TV's electronics. This is an artifact of the TV's analog circuitry. It is called \"hum\" because it sounds like a low hum. It is not a harmful noise. The TV turns off using a circuit called the \"SAFT\", which stands for \"Silent Auxiliary Fan Turn-off\". The hum stops when the TV turns off.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries run out of power when they are\ncharged to a high voltage.

It is a theory of the universe in which the universe was initially a hot dense state and has since been cooling. The universe was expanded from a very small hot dense state (about 10^{-12} seconds after the Big Bang) until it expanded to the size of the present universe. It was then a very hot and dense state, but the hot and dense state was so hot that it was a plasma of charged particles.

All animals have some form of value and benefit to the ecosystem and our survival. It is just our perception of these animals that makes them seem dangerous. For example, lions and tigers are not dangerous to us, they just have a strong predatory instinct which makes them appear dangerous. However, we have evolved to the point where we have a strong predatory instinct as well. That's why we perceive lions and tigers to be dangerous. They are not dangerous, they are just strong and fast.\n\nSim", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Ethernet is a\nprotocol that can be\ntransported over\ncable and fiber, but\nalso over air.

We have three types of cones that help us to see colours. One is called the long wavelengths cones, which can see violet colours. The second type is called the medium wavelengths cones, which can see green colours. The third type is called the short wavelengths cones, which can see red colours. Each cone is sensitive to a specific part of the light spectrum. So we are able to see different colours when light hits our eye.", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 3rd world countries are underdeveloped because of the lack of infrastructure, such as roads, transportation, and education.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Because the cell walls of the cut cabbage are weaker than when whole. This makes it easier for the water to escape. This is why we always cut our vegetables before we cook them.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: As we are made of about 60% water, when we get in a hot tub or bath our body temperature and water temperature are similar. Our skin then acts as a barrier to prevent the water from evaporating. When we get out of the water, the evaporation rate is different than the rate when we were in the water, which leads to the water vaporizing out of our body. This results in wrinkling of the skin because it is a tougher barrier to protect our body when we are outside the water.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because the Moon is over 300,000 km away, and the equipment was left on the surface, so the light from it would take 300,000 km/300,000,000 seconds = 1.0 s to reach us. The light from objects billions of light years away would take 1.0 s to reach us. The equipment on the surface of the Moon would take 300,000 km/300,000,000 s = 1.0 s to reach the telescope", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you drink a liquid, your body must first break down the liquid in order to absorb it. During this process, your body uses water to break down the liquid into its components. As a result, drinking a liquid dehydrates you.\n\nDrinking a liquid also requires your mouth to remain open for a period of time. This increases the amount of time you are breathing in the liquid, which can lead to excess water being pulled from your lungs into your stomach. This can lead to water intoxication, which can cause you to become confused or disoriented.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hispanic is a U.S. national origin group.

Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I agree that it would be nice to have a machine that does both. However, washing machines and dryers have different purposes. Washing machines wash the clothes by agitating the clothes in water. Dryers use heat to dry the clothes. It's difficult to design a machine that does both because the two processes use different forces. If you try to mix the two, the clothes will get damaged.\n\nDrying clothes is more difficult because of the size and shape of clothes.

It compares adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
