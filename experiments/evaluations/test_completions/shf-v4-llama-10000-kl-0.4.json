As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: Eggs harden when they are boiled because the water inside the egg is replaced by a substance called albumin. This albumin is a protein that is very flexible and can stretch a lot, but it cannot absorb water. When the egg is boiled, the heat causes the albumin to tighten and the egg to harden. \n\nPasta softens because when it is boiled, the starches in the pasta become sticky and form a gel. This gel is not as flexible as the egg albumin, and so it cannot stretch as much as the albumin in the egg", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hello,", "\n\nHuman: The Watergate scandal and why it happened\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Watergate Scandal\n\n[removed]\n\nWatergate Scandal\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nWatergate Scandal\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nWatergate Scandal\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nWatergate Scandal\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nWatergate Scandal\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\nWatergate Scandal\n\n[rem", "\n\nHuman: You don't sail, pilot, or drive a kayak, surely.

What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer is that trains pull cars because the cars are attached to the train using a locomotive. The locomotive is the engine that powers the train. The locomotive can pull many cars because the locomotive has a large amount of power. The power that the locomotive has is called the \"power of the locomotive\". The power of the locomotive is determined by the size of the engine, the amount of fuel it uses, and the amount of energy it produces. The power of the locomotive is measured in units called \"horsepower\" (HP).
