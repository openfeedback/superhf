Or (I assume) it was just advantageous for the chieftains to perpetuate?\n\nAssistant: It is possible that this idea was passed down through generations and was seen as a way to honor and glorify those who died in battle, which in turn encouraged more people to fight bravely.

Why is that, and why do some need it and some others don't?\n\nAssistant: I can provide some background on why headphones might sound better after being used for a while.  Headphones are made up of many components, such as drivers, cables, and electronics. When a headphone is first purchased, the parts may not be properly aligned, resulting in a slightly muffled sound or a lack of bass. Over time, the parts may settle into their proper positions and the sound may be improved. Additionally, the headphones may be tuned to the user's hearing curve, allowing for a more natural sound.  This can also be achieved by equalizing the sound or", "\n\nHuman: What social factors caused Austin, a liberal hipster enclave, to develop in the middle of a highly conservative state?\n\nIt's something I've thought about fairly often lately.

For instance, the repeating decimal 1.111111... is infinite, but you'll never find a 5 in there along the way. However, infinitely repeating numbers and an infinite universe (or infinite number of universes) seem like an entirely different concept.\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting point. We don't have a definite answer to that. It's likely that any scenario you can imagine is happening somewhere in an infinite universe. However, it's impossible to know for sure.", "\n\nHuman: What is the Fast Fourier Transform? (Or FFT) and how does one go on implementing it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a mathematical algorithm that converts a signal (such as an audio signal) from the time domain to the frequency domain. It can also be used to convert a signal from the frequency domain to the time domain. It is often used in signal processing applications, such as audio and image processing.\n\nTo implement the FFT, one first divides the signal into segments of data, called \"fingerprints\". The number of samples in each fingerprint is usually a power of two, such as 2^n, where n is an integer. Then, the signal is transformed into", "\n\nHuman: Audio Data Compression\n\nI'm working on a project where we have to compress an audio file (so we can have it be loseless) and we have to judge SQNR as well as sound quality compared to original (qualitative). \n\nI'm not sure how any of this works (my professor doesn't seem that good at explaining things).

I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \"safe options\"?", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't casting agents celebrated at awards ceremonies like the Emmys and the Oscars?\n\nI think pretty much everyone on the planet agrees that whoever chose the actors for the *Harry Potter* movies did the absolute best job humanly possible. Likewise, *Game of Thrones* is a masterpiece of a television show in part because the actors so perfectly fit the roles they have been assigned to play.\n\nWhy aren't the people who make these decisions, which are so important to the success or failure of a movie or show, given major awards like the Emmys or the Oscars? I, for one, certainly think they deserve the recognition.\n\nAssistant: What do you think?", "\n\nHuman: How I'm productive at the library as opposed to being lazy and drowsy at home?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That's a good question.

What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: Well, Americans often rely on credit cards to make purchases that they wouldn't otherwise be able to afford. Many people use credit cards as a form of instant gratification, buying things that they want now without having to save up for them. This can lead to people getting into debt that they cannot afford to pay back, and it can be very stressful.", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: Because the process of aluminum oxidation is not the same as the rusting of steel.

It is considered a bad sign if the baby does not cry, as this could indicate that something is wrong and the baby is not responding to stimuli.", "\n\nHuman: Is the US Police really becoming an arbitrary tool or is it just the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts?\n\nGerman student here. I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\".

I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: Well Kirchhoff's first law states that the current entering a junction is equal to the current leaving it, but it can also be used to calculate the currents in a circuit when there are multiple sources of current. It can also be used to determine the resistance of a circuit.", "\n\nHuman: Why does rain look stationary from a distance?\n\nWhen looking at a thunderstorm from far away you can see the rain coming down to the ground but it just looks as if the cloud is extended in sheets towards the earth.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: Microsoft Support", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the amount of light entering the lens is proportional to the area of the aperture. A larger aperture allows more light to pass through, resulting in a shallower depth of field, while a smaller aperture allows less light to pass, resulting in a greater depth of field.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: Are you referring to on-screen or behind-the-scenes work?", "\n\nHuman: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Chinese and Mexican food typically contain high amounts of spicy and/", "\n\nHuman: why do giraffes have horns?\n\nI was just wondering...\nEdit: thanks for all the responses you guys even the bad ones :D And no I don't think that giraffes have ended their evolution process, your reading into it to much.\n\nAssistant: No, I'm not. Giraffes have horns for defense against predators, to help them in fights, and for showing off to attract mates. They are an example of a species that has not evolved past their current state, since they have no need to.  They are well adapted to their environment and do not require any more evolutionary changes.  Do you have any other questions?", "\n\nHuman: Can you change the temperature of a subject with sound alone?\n\nTo clarify I don't mean temperature produced by whatever produces the sound. I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: Can you provide a bit more context? What kind of sound waves and what kind of chemical solution? What is the temperature you are looking to increase?", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but it could be that the ink is dry or the pen is running out of ink. Have you tried a different pen?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we drool when we sleep? More specifically during daytime naps...\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but it could be due to the relaxed state of the body during sleep, which causes the muscles to relax and the tongue to hang loosely. It could also be related to an increase in body temperature which causes the saliva to become thinner and easier to drool.", "\n\nHuman: What's the purpose of the mysterious slash at the end of URLs?\n\nExample 1: type \"reddit\" in Google. Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: The purpose of the slash at the end of URLs is to indicate that it is a subdirectory of the parent website. This is especially useful for websites that have multiple pages or sections that are related, but still part of the same website. It helps the website load faster and also helps the website maintain an organized structure.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the US have to be close allies with Saudi Arabia?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

Metal and lava are two examples of materials that turn red when they are heated. This is because the molecules in these materials are vibrating faster when they are hot, which causes them to absorb more red light and reflect less blue and green light. This gives them a red hue.", "\n\nHuman: why pillows, blankets, etc have those tags that are \"penalized by law\" if removed by anyone but the consumer\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the law?", "\n\nHuman: Why is there a statute of limitations?\n\nIt seems like it only really protects criminals (i.e. Bill Cosby), so why do we have it?\n\nAssistant: To prevent people from being tried for the same crime multiple times.", "\n\nHuman: How do people accidentally die from auto-erotic asphyxiation?\n\nIf the human brain can survive for upwards of 3 minutes (no training) without oxygen, how do so many people accidentally kill themselves while asphyxiating themselves/having their partner asphyxiate them during sex/masturbation? Can't they just stop choking themselves when it gets sketchy?
