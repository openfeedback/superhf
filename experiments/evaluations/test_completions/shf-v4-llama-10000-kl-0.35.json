They are usually smaller labels that are more interested in the artist and their music than in making money. They usually don't have a lot of money to spend on marketing so they rely on word of mouth and the artist to get their music out there. Indie labels are usually a lot more hands on with the artist.

Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Yes, sir.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Yes, it would show that you had been gone for 20 years. Time is the same everywhere in the universe. If you were to travel away from earth, time would pass at the same rate, but you would age much faster. This is due to the fact that you are moving away from the center of the galaxy, which is what causes time to pass at a slower rate on earth.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 seconds.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Yes. The liver is the organ that breaks down fats and produces bile. The bile is stored in the gallbladder until it is needed to digest fats. Bile is produced by the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and released into the small intestine to help digest food. Bile breaks down fats in the small intestine so that they can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Bile also helps to absorb vitamins, such as vitamin D, that are in foods.\n\nFat is a triglyceride,", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: A high pitch ringing noise is the result of a television's capacitor discharging. This happens when the TV's power is turned off. The capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy and is used to keep the TV on. It is made up of two metal plates separated by an insulating material. When the TV is turned off, the capacitor discharges its energy through the coil. This causes a high pitched sound. When the TV is turned on, the capacitor is charged by the power supply.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries are not a power source.
