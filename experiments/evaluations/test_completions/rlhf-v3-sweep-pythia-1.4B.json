Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window.

I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency?
