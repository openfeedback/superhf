How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: Box office is the revenue from tickets. The cost of production includes all the costs of making the movie, but that is not the box office revenue. The box office revenue is what the movie earns from tickets. The budget is also not the box office revenue. The budget is the cost of making the movie. So a movie like Interstellar that cost 165m to make, made 173m.

If I was to cut it in half, how would it know to start growing again?\n\nAssistant: Well, your armpit hair is a very long and very delicate hair that grows from the skin. This hair is connected to a hair follicle, which is connected to the skin. The hair follicle is surrounded by a muscle.\n\nThe muscle is controlled by the brain. When the brain sends a signal to the muscle, the muscle contracts and the hair follicle is forced upwards, causing hair to grow. This process is called anagenesis.\n\nWhen the hair reaches a certain length, the brain sends a signal to the muscle to stop, and the hair", "\n\nHuman: How do wireless phone chargers work\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: How do wireless phone chargers work", "\n\nHuman: What are sensitive teeth?

First, hair gets oily when oil and dirt build up, so the hair doesn't absorb water as well. Shampoo cleanses your hair and gets rid of the oils. Second, hair contains proteins which are naturally greasy. When they dry out, they form a protective layer on your hair, which can make your hair look greasy. Shampoo removes that layer and gets rid of the grease.", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it?

And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: The answer to this question is somewhat complex. It is related to circadian rhythms. These are biological processes that are driven by an internal clock, called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The suprachiasmatic nucleus is regulated by a number of factors, including the amount of light that we are exposed to. When we are exposed to a lot of light, our suprachiasmatic nucleus is active, and we are awake. When we are exposed to less light, our suprachiasmatic nucleus is inactive, and we are asleep.

Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The best way to answer your question is to first consider how the world evolved. In the early days of computing, the hardware was very limited. Most people used the same hardware and software and couldn\u2019t really do anything new or different. This was the \u201cwaterfall\u201d era of computing, where new ideas would come down the pipe from the top.", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 10^99 is too large.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow.

I'll have to do some more research.", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Here is a very simple explanation of the Uncertainty Principle.\n\nLet's say you want to measure the position of a particle at a certain time. To do this, you must make a measurement of the position at a different time, in order to calculate the position of the particle at the time you want.\n\nIf you make the measurement at the same time as the time you want, you will not have any uncertainty in the position.\n\nIf you make the measurement at a different time, then you have a minimum uncertainty in the position of the particle, but you have a maximum uncertainty in the time.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a common term in physics. It refers to the difference between the current performance of an object and its previous performance. In many systems, the current performance of an object depends on the history of that object.  Hysteresis is the term used to describe the difference between the current performance of an object and the current performance of the object in the past.\n\nHysteresis can be thought of as a kind of \"memory\" of the system.  For example, the temperature of an object might depend on its previous temperature.  If the temperature of an object in the past was 10", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: Europe is more liberal than America because it has a more leftist political culture. \n\nEuropean countries are more leftist in terms of their economic and social policies.  For example, Europe has a higher tax rate, higher minimum wage, and more regulation of business.  This means that the government is more involved in the economy, and less people are left to fend for themselves.  As a result, there are more social programs and a more social safety net.  This creates a more liberal political culture, in which the government is more involved in the lives of citizens.\n\nThe US is more", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Rubbing your eyes when tired causes blood vessels to dilate, which brings more blood to the surface of your eyes.

They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: 6 cores vs 8 cores.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm afraid I'm not sure what you're asking. Can you please clarify?", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: I would say it's not realistic, but it's not like it's out of the question. People with cancer can have different symptoms, some of which may not be as obvious as others. It's definitely possible that someone could have the disease and not know it for a long time.\n\nIt's not necessarily unrealistic that someone could go to the doctor and be told they have cancer, but not have any symptoms. It's also not unrealistic that someone could have cancer and not be aware of it.\n\nIt's hard to say how realistic this scenario", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't have any information about that.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It depends on the nature of the problem. It is important to note that the Middle East is a very diverse region. In some countries, the people have similar cultures and speak the same language, and so it would be very easy for them to unite. In other countries, however, there are many ethnic groups and languages, so a united region would be much more difficult.", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: It's the calorie density.  Sugar is an energy source.  But the energy is not good for your body.  It's like alcohol, you can get drunk on it, and it's not good for you.  But if you're a healthy person and you have the right amount of calories, you don't have to worry about it.  But if you're trying to lose weight, you need to eat less calories than you're burning, and sugar is a calorie dense food.

If we consider a Chess board with only 1 piece, then the number of possible positions is 1. If we consider a Chess board with 10 pieces, then the number of possible positions is 1010. If we consider a Chess board with 100 pieces, then the number of possible positions is 10100.

Cannibalism also causes the species to be more aggressive. But in the case of the black widow, the species has not evolved to eat its mate, so there is no evolutionary pressure to evolve to eat its mate.", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: lemons and limes are also fruit.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure if I understand what you mean by \"product placement\" here.

We actually know very little about the ancient human remains we find. There are a number of possible reasons why we find so many remains from children. The first is that we find them in places where they were likely buried. This could be for a number of reasons. They could have been buried in a place that was sacred to the people who buried them. The second is that they were buried in a place that was easy to get to, so the people who buried them could come to them.

How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: EL15:  Yes, there is a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet.  This limit is called the \"capacity of the channel\" and is determined by the speed of the channel.  The amount of information that can be sent over a cable internet channel is determined by the speed of the channel and the amount of information that is being sent.

Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a physiological state of torpor and hypothermia, during which the animal is inactive. Hibernation is most commonly observed in mammals, but may also occur in insects and other animals, including birds and fish. The word hibernation comes from the Latin word hibernare, meaning \u201cto winter\u201d.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: It is currently not possible to bring a Neanderthal back into existence, for a variety of reasons.  First of all, we have not yet discovered a way to bring a Neanderthal into existence using only human DNA.  Secondly, the Neanderthal genome is quite different from that of modern humans, so it would be extremely difficult to modify human DNA to resemble the Neanderthal genome.  Thirdly, we have not yet discovered a way to transfer a Neanderthal genome into a human egg.

Shrimp, because it is a small animal, cooks much faster than meat.  This causes the shrimp to turn orange, while the meat remains red.  The reason for this is that cooking causes the proteins in the meat to break down, and the color of the protein is determined by how much of the protein is broken down.  When cooking shrimp, the proteins are broken down much more quickly than they are in meat.  When cooking meat, the proteins are broken down more slowly", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: Zero is a number, not a variable.

When you cough, air is forced out of the lungs, which in turn causes the capillaries to contract, and the walls of the alveoli to expand. This increases the pressure within the alveoli, which causes air to be pushed out of them.
