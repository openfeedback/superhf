What made computers like the Cray so large and expensive, and have the features that they were designed to provide been shrunk and mass-produced with our technological progression?\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the explanations y'all.\n\nAssistant: A Cray supercomputer is a large machine that is used to perform massive computations.  It is usually made up of hundreds of computer nodes.  Each node is made up of a CPU, RAM, and a disk drive.  The nodes are networked together to form a single large computer.  The nodes are arranged in a way that allows the computer to perform massive computations.  A supercomputer is designed to perform one specific task very well.  A desktop computer is designed to perform many different tasks and is usually a single node.

For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The movie business is not an easy one to explain. I think it's important to understand that the movie business is a business. When a movie is made, the studio has to make a profit. The movie has to earn more than what was spent to make it. The studio also has to pay for marketing and advertising. The box office is just a small part of that. The movie also has to be sold to cable TV, to video, to foreign countries, to DVD, to Netflix, and to pay-per-view.

However, the cancer rate for humans is high. \n\nCancer is a disease of the cells in our body. The cells in the body can become abnormal, and grow out of control. This abnormal growth is called a tumor. A tumor can be benign or malignant. A benign tumor does not spread to other parts of the body.

My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth are a common problem. Sensitive teeth are caused by tooth decay. Sensitive teeth can also be caused by the removal of too much tooth structure during teeth cleaning. When this happens, the tooth enamel is too thin, so the tooth is more sensitive to hot and cold foods and drinks.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: Shampoo contains a surfactant that helps remove the greasy feel by reducing the surface tension of the hair. The surfactant molecules are negatively charged and will bind to the positive charges on the hair. This decreases the area between the hair and the surfactant, which decreases the surface tension between them. The decrease in surface tension allows the surfactant molecules to spread out, which reduces the greasy feel.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it?

But I do know a little about eczema.  Eczema is a skin condition that makes your skin itchy, red, and dry.  It can also cause your skin to crack and bleed.  Eczema is most common in babies.  But it can happen in adults too.  It is not contagious.  It can be triggered by a lot of things, like things you put on your skin, like soap, lotions, and makeup.

First, compression clothing reduces the amount of swelling in the muscles and joints, which is caused by inflammation. This swelling reduces the amount of space available for blood to flow through the muscles and joints, which reduces the amount of oxygen and nutrients that can get to the muscles and joints. Second, compression clothing reduces the amount of muscle fatigue and soreness caused by exercise, which is due to muscle lactic acid building up. Third, compression clothing improves the circul", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens when you pull your back?

When the disc is herniated, it can press on the nerve root and cause pain, numbness, and tingling in the legs. A ruptured disc may also cause pain and numbness, but the pain usually goes away after a few days. The ruptured disc does not usually cause a problem unless it puts", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: Exchange rates are the relative prices of two countries' currencies in terms of each other. For example, if a dollar buys 0.75 euros, then the dollar/euro exchange rate is 0.75. Exchange rates are important because they determine the price of imported goods. If the dollar/euro exchange rate rises, then the dollar will buy fewer euros, and the price of goods from Europe will rise. If the dollar/euro exchange rate falls, then the dollar will buy more euros, and the price of goods from Europe will fall.", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand the question.\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport sys\n\nfrom nltk.corpus import treebank\nfrom nltk.corpus import treebank_tagged\nfrom nltk.tag.stanford import pos_tag\nfrom nltk.tag import Tagger\n\nfrom nltk.util import ngrams\nfrom nltk.tag import StanfordPOSTagger\n\n\n\n# Treebank\nprint \"Using Treebank...\\n\"\ntreebank_path", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day.

Hysteresis is the difference between the value of a system at a given time and the value of the system at the same time but in a different state of the operating conditions. Hysteresis is also the difference between the value of a system at a given time and the value of the system at the same time but in a different state of the operating conditions.\n\nHysteresis is a common phenomenon, but it is also a very complicated concept.

Our facial muscles control the way we move our face. Our eyelids help us keep our eyes moist and protect them from dust and other foreign materials. The eyelids also keep our eyes from drying out and losing moisture. When we get tired, our muscles need more oxygen to function. Our eyelids, like the rest of our muscles, need more oxygen when we are tired. When we are tired, our eyelids become", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

The machine can detect the presence of THC. The machine cannot tell the difference between THC that is naturally occurring in your body from THC that you might have taken from a drug. It just detects the presence of THC.

I can give you a number of reasons for that. The first one is that children are easier to preserve than adults.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Water molecules are attracted to each other. They tend to gather together in large groups. This is called cohesion. The molecules are also attracted to the surface of the bowl, and the bowl itself. This is called adhesion. When the bowl is placed in the refrigerator, the temperature drops. The molecules in the water and the water itself, become cooler. This causes them to slow down. This slowing down causes the molecules to be less attracted to each other, and to the bowl. This is called decreased cohesion.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water is a good solvent for the protein in our skin.
