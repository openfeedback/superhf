Babies also have a lot of fluid in their bodies, so they can shift their weight around and be less affected by gravity.

As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: I will explain both. Eggs are a protein. Protein is made up of amino acids. Amino acids are made up of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens. When a protein is heated, the carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens are broken apart, and the amino acids are freed. When the amino acids are free, they are able to interact with each other and form new bonds. These new bonds are stronger than the original bonds that held the amino acids together, and this is why the egg", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Yes, sir.", "\n\nHuman: The Watergate scandal and why it happened\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We've just received a call from the White House.", "\n\nHuman: You don't sail, pilot, or drive a kayak, surely.

Batteries are also a renewable energy source because they can be recharged and used many times.\n\nBatteries convert chemical energy into electrical energy.

Cancer cells are cells that have changed and have lost their ability to control their growth. These cells can grow out of control and form tumors.

Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Your liver stores bile in its bile ducts. Bile is a substance that helps the digestion of fats. It is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. The bile ducts carry bile from the liver to the small intestine. The bile helps to break down the fats in the small intestine so that they can be absorbed.  The pancreas produces digestive juices, which contain enzymes that help to break down fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.

Because water molecules are attracted to each other and to the skin, the skin has a hard time pushing them off. Water molecules are also attracted to the oils in the skin, which makes them harder to push off as well. The result of this is that the water molecules are stuck to the skin and the skin is hard to push off.
