It is a way to measure the value of a good or a service. For example, if a cup of coffee costs $2, then we can say that 1 cup of coffee is worth $2.\n\nCurrency is also a store of value, meaning that we can use it to save money. When we save money, we are effectively putting it in a safe place where it can grow. For example, if we save $100 a month, then after 10 years, we will have $12,000. This is because we", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, how did they afford it?", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: Sleep is a requirement for the health of all mammals. It is an essential part of the mammalian life cycle.\n\nSleep is a complex biological function. It is regulated by a multitude of neurotransmitters and hormones. The sleep-wake cycle is controlled by a set of interacting clocks located in the brain and the periphery. These clocks are driven by a number of different inputs, including light, darkness, temperature, exercise, stress, and hormones.\n\nIn mammals, sleep is regulated by a circadian", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time?

Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The uncertainty principle says that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle. This is because knowing the position of a particle to a high degree of accuracy requires a large amount of energy, which leads to a large amount of momentum, and vice versa.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta x \\Delta p > \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWhere $\\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in the position of a particle and $\\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in its momentum.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta x \\Delta p > \\frac", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis?

They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: A 6-core AMD CPU has 6 cores and 12 threads. A 6-core Intel CPU has 6 cores and 12 threads.

Bandwidth is a measure of the maximum amount of data that can be sent over a network in a given period of time.  Bandwidth is measured in bits per second (bps) and is typically expressed in units of megabits per second (Mbps) or gigabits per second (Gbps).  The maximum amount of data that can be sent through a network is limited by the amount of bandwidth available.  The amount of bandwidth available is determined by the maximum amount of data that can be sent per second and the length of time the data can be sent", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The human has been removed from the queue.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem?

I think that most guys who are interested in sex with a stranger are interested in sex with a woman that they find attractive.  They're not interested in sex with any woman.

The explosive charge is the thing that burns your skin.  The shell, as a whole, is not going to burn you, but the firecracker inside will.

It is a vibration that travels through a solid, liquid or gas, which is called the medium. Sound waves are longitudinal waves, which means that they are characterised by a wave of vibration that moves in the direction of propagation. Sound waves are produced by vibrating objects. The vibrations produce changes in the pressure, which in turn creates changes in the air particles.

Liberalism advocates civil liberties with a limited government under the rule of law, private property, and belief in the inherent worth of the individual, as well as the equality of all people.\n\nLiberalism began in the 17th century as a movement that challenged the authority of the monarchy and the privileges of the aristocracy.

What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are a way of expressing a number by only using the digits that are significant.\n\nSignificant digits are used to express a number to a certain degree of accuracy.\n\nFor example, if you have 22.3 + 3.45, it would be 25.75.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: A gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ located in the upper right side of the abdomen, just beneath the liver.

The liver also produces bile, which is stored in the gallbladder.

The receptor is activated by chemicals that are released when we sweat, and when the receptor is activated, it sends a message to the brain that the skin is hot.
