Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it.

When you take a picture with an aperture of f/5.6, your depth of field will be around 5mm. This means that the amount of light that enters your camera will be about 5mm. If you take a picture with a camera with a f/8 aperture, your depth of field will be about 8mm. This means that the amount of light that enters your camera will be about 8mm. This is because the aperture is wider than the focal length. When you take a picture with a camera with a f/2.8 aperture, your depth of field will be", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: Yes, we have a policy that requires that children under the age of five must have a guardian present when they are working.", "\n\nHuman: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The medicines are not safe for consumption beyond the expiry date.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We don't.
