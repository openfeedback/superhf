I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nWell, when you flip a coin you are trying to get a heads or a tails.  So if you have 100 heads in a row, you are more likely to get a heads the next time you flip the coin, right?  If someone says that you have a 50% chance of getting heads or tails, then they are saying that the probability of getting heads is the same as the probability of getting tails.
