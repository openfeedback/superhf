This is usually the result of an awkward or sudden movement, such as twisting your body or lifting something too heavy.\n\nThe pain is usually felt in the middle of the back, but it can also be felt in the lower back, which is called the lumbar region.\n\nIn most cases, back pain will go away on its own within 1-2 weeks. However, if the pain does not go away, or if it keeps returning, you may need to see a doctor.", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: Currency is traded on an exchange market. The exchange rate is the price of one currency (the first currency) for another (the second currency).\n\nFor example, the exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Indian Rupee is 1 USD = 70.77 INR.\n\nThe value of a currency is determined by the supply and demand for that currency. If the supply is high and the demand is low, the value of a currency will drop. If the supply is low and the demand is high, the value of a currency will increase.\n\nWhen a currency is trad", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hippy generation was able to afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle because they were the children of the baby boomers. The baby boomers were the generation after World War II. During this time period, there was a lot of work, and the baby boomers were able to enjoy the hippy lifestyle because they had jobs. When the hippy generation grew up, they were able to afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers because they were the children of the baby boomers.", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day.

Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers get better over time because there is a constant research and development to make them better. Over time, it is easier to make changes and improvements to the hardware and software. This means that it is cheaper and easier to make better computers.\n\nBecause of the research and development, computers can be built to be smaller and more compact. As technology advances, it is easier to make smaller and smaller computers.\n\nAs computers get better, it is easier to add more features. It is now easier to make computers that can perform more tasks at the same time. This means that computers can do more things, and", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 10^99 = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: This is not good for you. Chewing your food properly and completely is important for digestion. You should chew your food at least 10 times before swallowing. Also, if you eat too fast you swallow air and that is why you have stinky farts.\n\nThank you, HintBot.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: There are several factors that contribute to the taste of medications, such as the chemical composition of the drug, the physical form of the drug, the rate of administration, and the method of administration.\n\nA drug's chemical composition is often a major factor in the taste of the drug. For example, the bitter taste of tasteless morphine is caused by the chemical compound methylmorphine. The rate of administration also contributes to the taste of a drug. For example, the bitter taste of morphine administered IV is caused by the chemical compound methylmorphine. However", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that it is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle.\n\nThe equation in your textbook is the mathematical expression of the Principle.\n\nThe equation is telling you that if you know the exact position of a particle, then you cannot know the exact momentum of the particle.\n\nIf you know the exact momentum of the particle, then you cannot know the exact position of the particle.\n\nIf you do not know the exact position or momentum, then the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is not violated.\n\nYou can measure", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a property of a system, whereby the system responds more to a change in the present conditions rather than the initial conditions. In other words, the system has a memory of its past, and the system will react more to a change in the present than the initial conditions.\n\nHysteresis is common in systems that are driven by a feedback loop. For example, a thermostat has a hysteresis when it is in a feedback loop. The thermostat will react to the current temperature, and will not immediately react to a change in the initial temperature. This is because the", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

When you are tired, your eyes feel heavy and you feel a need to rub them. Rubbing the eyes helps you to feel more awake and alert. Rubbing your eyes also helps to remove any crust that has built up on the eyelids. Rubbing your eyes also helps to clear your eyes of any irritants, such as dust or smoke. Rubbing your eyes can also help to relieve a headache. If your eyes are feeling dry and tired, you can also use a lubricating eye drop to help relieve the tiredness and irrit", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: A CPU is the \"central processing unit\" of a computer. It is responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It is connected to the other parts of the computer through a motherboard.\n\nThe number of cores refers to the number of \"threads\" the CPU can handle simultaneously. The more cores, the more calculations the CPU can handle in parallel, thus increasing the performance. \n\nA CPU with 8 cores will be much faster than one with 6 cores. However, the cores on the CPU are connected to each other, so they share memory. As a result, the performance is limited by the speed of the", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Eyelids twitching when you're sleep deprived is a classic sign of sleep deprivation. The twitching is caused by a lack of sleep.\n\nWhen you are sleep deprived, your body tries to sleep and your brain keeps telling you to stay awake. The brain is the body's central control center, so when it tells you to stay awake, it causes the muscles in your body to tense. This includes the muscles in your eyes.\n\nWhen the eyes are tensed, they can cause the eyelids to twitch. If you", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: I think it's more realistic that people have symptoms that they don't recognize as related to their condition.  For example, many people with lung cancer don't have symptoms until the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. So, in those six months, they're probably going to be having a good time with their relatives, and then they'll get a diagnosis and a six month prognosis.  But by that time, they may already be experiencing symptoms.  Also, the prognosis is usually only 6 months, but it's not necessarily that they", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It is not the music itself that is canned and compressed, but the audio recording of the human voice, which is often used to produce the hold music. The recordings are produced using the same technology and techniques used in voiceovers for commercials and other media. The human voice is recorded in a sound studio, and then the recording is digitally compressed to make it fit on a small data file. This is called \"audio watermarking\" and is done in order to reduce the file size. The voice is then re-recorded, often by a different person, and the result is a can", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Middle East would be a lot more peaceful.

A power brick is an external power supply that connects to the console and provides power. This is different than the PS4 that uses a power cable to connect to the wall outlet and gets power directly from there. This is done because the PS4 only requires a small amount of power compared to the Xbox One. The Xbox One requires a large amount of power and requires a power brick. The power brick is the reason why the Xbox One needs to be plugged in with a cable. The PS4 is directly powered by the wall outlet and", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: Chlorophyll is green because it absorbs light in the red and blue parts of the visible spectrum, but reflects the green part of the spectrum.\n\nChlorophyll is a green pigment that is essential for photosynthesis in plants and algae. \n\nPlants use chlorophyll to convert light energy into chemical energy in a process called photosynthesis. \n\nChlorophyll is a complex molecule composed of a magnesium ion and a porphyrin ring that is linked to a long chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms. \n\nChlor", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Cannabinoid anandamide is only one of the cannabinoid molecules that can be produced in the body. There are more than 100 other cannabinoids, and the body naturally produces them. THC is only one of the 100+ cannabinoids in the body.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A liquid has to be so viscous that it can no longer flow. Viscosity is a measure of the resistance of a liquid to flow, and it is defined as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate.\n\nA liquid is considered to be a fluid if it can flow. Fluids have a finite shear stress, and therefore, a finite viscosity. The viscosity of a fluid is directly related to its shear stress, and it is inversely related to its shear rate.\n\nA liquid is considered to be a liquid if it has a viscosity less", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre was a major shareholder in Skyfleet stocks. He was planning to use this stock to buy the airliner.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Wetness has two major effects on smell:\n\n- Wetness decreases surface area. Surface area is a major factor in how well a chemical can spread. When a substance is wet, it has a much smaller surface area than when it is dry, so it can't spread as much.\n\n- Wetness changes the surface of the substance. When a substance is dry, the surface is flat, but when it is wet, the surface is bumpy. This makes it harder for a chemical to spread evenly.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nThank you", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Thanks for your question! It is a great one. \n\nThere are a number of reasons for this. First, remains from children are much more likely to be preserved than remains from adults. This is because children are generally smaller, and softer, than adults. Additionally, children often die from disease rather than violent death, so they are less likely to be preserved by the elements.  \n\nAnother reason is that in many cultures, children are more important to their families, so they are often buried with more care and in more elaborate graves. This is especially true for children of the elite.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Physical differences between the two sexes in humans and lions are due to the sexual dimorphism.\n\nSexual dimorphism is a difference in physical characteristics between the two sexes. It is a general term used in biology to refer to the presence of such differences.\n\nSexual dimorphism is a characteristic of most species that have two sexes.
