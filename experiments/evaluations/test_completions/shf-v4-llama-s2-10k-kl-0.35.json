So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is bad for you because it is addictive. It triggers a release of dopamine, which is the feel-good chemical, and also causes a release of insulin, which causes your body to store fat.  Sugar causes your body to release more insulin than it needs, which causes your body to store fat.  Sugar also causes an inflammatory response in the body, which is why you feel tired and sick after eating a bunch of sugar.  Sugar is also a very calorie dense substance, so it causes weight gain easily.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Yes.  The problem is that you cannot assume that the next coin flip will be independent.  It is not.  The more heads in a row, the more likely it is that the next coin flip will be heads.  This is because the coin flips are not independent.  If you have 10 heads in a row, then the odds are that the next flip will be heads.  If you have 100 heads in a row, then the odds are even greater that the next flip will be heads.
