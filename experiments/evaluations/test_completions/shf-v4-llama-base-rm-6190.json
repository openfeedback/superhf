How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: There are no theoretical limits to the amount of information that can be sent over a cable internet connection.  The amount of information that can be sent is determined by the speed of the connection.  For example, a connection with a speed of 100 Mbps can send about 12.5 MB of information per second.  (100 Mbps = 12.5 MB/s)  This means that if you want to send 1 MB of information, it will take about 8 seconds to send.
