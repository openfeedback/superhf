The resistance of the heating element is therefore 230 / 300 = 0.76 Ohm. The power dissipated by the heating element is therefore 230 * 0.76 = 174 W. The heating element is in series with a water flow of 5 L/min. The water flow therefore heats up to 174 / 5", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014.

What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Water has a higher surface area than other liquids. The higher the surface area, the more it can interact with air. When something is wet, it has a much higher surface area than when it's dry. This gives it more opportunity to interact with air and thus, smell.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item A molecule of water is shaped like a teardrop, with two ends and a flat surface.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t think this question is well suited to Reddit, as there\u2019s no way to answer it.  The answer could be as simple as \u201cthey were buried with their parents\u201d, or it could be as complex as \u201cthey were a sacrifice to the gods\u201d.  You\u2019ll have to find a good research paper on the subject to get a good answer.  I suggest you start with [this one](_URL_1_) and read through the references.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: A:  Bandwidth is a measure of the amount of data that can be transferred over a communication channel in a given amount of time.  Bandwidth is usually expressed in bits per second or bytes per second.  The more bandwidth, the more data that can be transferred.  The theoretical limit of bandwidth is the Shannon limit, which is the maximum amount of information that can be transferred in a given amount of time.  The Shannon limit is 1.6 bits per second per Hertz of bandwidth.  The Shannon limit is a theoretical limit, and it does not take into account the effects", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A watch?", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: You are correct.  The probability of a coin flip is 50% heads or tails.  Each flip is independent from the others.  The probability of a coin flip is the same regardless of how many times a coin has flipped before.  So if a coin has been flipped 10 times and each time the result is heads, the probability of a heads in the next flip is still 50% and the probability of a tails is still 50%.  It does not matter how many times the coin has flipped before.  The probability of", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It works by using a red laser to detect the position of the gun.
