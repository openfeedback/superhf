Or (I assume) it was just advantageous for the chieftains to perpetuate?\n\nAssistant: To answer your question, it's not clear what the 'beneficial to the chieftains' is.

The reason is pretty simple. Most people, when they go to a restaurant, order their meals in. It's not like they can't be heard when they walk by the kitchen or the other rooms.

At the top level, we have the \u201cbasic structure\u201d which is the basic structural feature of the language. The grammar consists of the grammatical rules that specify the order in which to use words in a sentence. For example, in the sentence \u201cHe is a man,\u201d the basic structure would be \u201cHe is a man\u201d or \u201cHe is a man (that is, he is a man)\u201d.

In the case of a signal that is being processed by a digital device, each number represents the amplitude of the signal at a specific frequency. So, for example, if you have a digital signal that is being processed by a digital device, the amplitude of the signal at a particular frequency is represented by a number. In the case of the FFT, each number is the amplitude of the signal at a particular frequency.", "\n\nHuman: Audio Data Compression\n\nI'm working on a project where we have to compress an audio file (so we can have it be loseless) and we have to judge SQNR as well as sound quality compared to original (qualitative). \n\nI'm not sure how any of this works (my professor doesn't seem that good at explaining things).

What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want?
