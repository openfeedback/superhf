We can confirm that chewing your food thoroughly is very important. When you chew your food, you are making your food easier to digest. When food is chewed thoroughly, the food is broken into smaller pieces that are easier to digest. Chewing also helps with the chemical digestion of food. During the chemical digestion of food, food is broken down into smaller pieces, and this allows for the release of enzymes and other chemicals that are needed for digestion. This allows your body to absorb more of the nutrients in your food.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The answer to this question is not easy to understand, but I will try my best to explain it to you. Time is a very abstract concept. It is the measurement of the duration between two events, and it can be measured in a number of different ways. One way is with a clock, which is a device that measures elapsed time with the help of a mechanism. The most common mechanism is a pendulum, which swings back and forth at a regular rate, and this rate is controlled by a clockwork mechanism that is powered by a weight or spring.
