And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: There is a strong correlation between the length of the day and the need for sleep. For instance, if there are long periods of daylight, animals will sleep for less time. \n\nWe are programmed to sleep based on the Earth's rotation, which is roughly 24 hours. \n\nThe rotation of the Earth was not fixed until the 19th century, and is still not fixed. \n\nSleep is a fundamental requirement of all animals, including humans, and is regulated by a sleep-wake cycle that is set by the circadian clock in the brain.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are many ways to explain this. One of the most obvious is that we get better at making computers. The technology that enables computers to get better is called Moore\u2019s Law. It says that the amount of information that can be put on a chip doubles every 18 months. The first computers only had 1 bit of information. Now we have computers with 1000s of bits of information.

Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that if you want to know both x and p, then you have to give up a bit of your knowledge about them.\n\nIf you have an uncertainty in x, then you also have to have an uncertainty in p, which means you have to give up a bit of your knowledge about p.\n\nIf you have an uncertainty in p, then you also have to have an uncertainty in x, which means you have to give up a bit of your knowledge about x.\n\nTherefore, if you want to know both x and p, you have to give up a bit", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: The best analogy I can think of is the difference between a ball and a bowling ball. A ball rolls, and a bowling ball bounces. So if you drop a ball, it will eventually stop. But if you drop a bowling ball, it will keep bouncing until it stops. This is because the ball has some momentum left, and the bowling ball has a lot of momentum. Hysteresis is like the momentum of a ball.\n\nIf you drop a bowling ball, it will bounce.

Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: A lot of liberals in America are just as socially liberal as people in Europe. The question is more about the political climate. The way that the political system in the United States is structured allows for a lot of economic inequality. In a lot of ways, the US is still a capitalist society, which means that it's structured so that the wealthiest people have a lot of power. In Europe, that's not the case. The way that their political systems are structured, they don't allow for a lot of that. That's why you have more people who are socially liberal in", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: When you are tired, the brain releases a hormone called  \"melatonin\" which is a powerful antioxidant. Melatonin helps regulate sleep/wake cycles. However, the release of melatonin is very sensitive to light. When exposed to light, the levels of melatonin in your body will fall and the levels of cortisol will rise. Cortisol is a stress hormone which may be one of the reasons why you feel tired. Rubbing your eyes may be a way for your brain to release more melatonin and help you feel more relaxed.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: This is a classic example of a price/performance trade-off. The more cores, the more power the processor needs to use. AMD CPUs use a more efficient architecture, so they can use less power and have less heat to dissipate. However, the more cores, the more power the processor needs.\n\nWith AMD, the more cores, the cheaper it gets. Intel has a different architecture, so they have to use more power to get the same performance. So, the more cores, the more power it needs, and the more expensive it gets.\n\nIn general, AMD is", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: One of the most common sleep disorders, sleep-related eyelid (lid) movement (or eyelid spasms) is a condition that causes the eyes to blink rapidly, involuntarily, and without warning. Sleep-related eyelid movement usually occurs in the second half of the night, but it can occur at any time during sleep.

There are also different stages of cancer. It is very common for people to have a cancer diagnosis that is not terminal, even if it is in a terminal stage.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It's not canned, it's just a looped recording.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The world would be a much more peaceful place.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar has many different effects on the body, but the main reason people try to limit sugar is that it can contribute to weight gain.\u00a0  Sugar has a very high energy density.\u00a0  Energy density is a measure of how many calories are packed into a serving of a food.\u00a0  For example, a serving of sugar (1 teaspoon) has 40 calories, whereas a serving of broccoli has only 3 calories.\u00a0  Sugar is also very sweet, so you only need a small amount to satisfy your sweet tooth.\u00a0  This makes it easy to", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

The more popular a post is, the more it is upvoted by users. The upvotes act as a sort of quality rating for the post. This is a common system for rating content online. Popular posts are not always the most interesting, they are just the most upvoted. This could be due to the popularity of the topic, or the quality of the post itself. For example, an interesting post about a popular topic like Game of Thrones can be more interesting to read than a popular post about a topic that is", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Nothing, it's a very soft question.

The first is that it prevents the console from overheating, which could lead to it breaking down. The second is that it is a safety measure, to prevent damage from being done to the unit if it is plugged into a power outlet and then unplugged before the power has been properly turned off.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: The green color of chlorophyll is due to a property of light called reflection.  When light hits a surface, it bounces off and continues in all directions.  The reflection of light depends on the \n\nsurface.  A mirror reflects all of the light that hits it, so light is reflected in all directions.  A black surface, however, absorbs all of the light that hits it.\n\nWhen light hits a surface, it bounces off and continues in all directions. The reflection of light depends on the surface.

Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: The mouse is a physical object that you can move around. The monitor is a display object that you can move your mouse around. The mouse and monitor are two different objects, but they can communicate with each other by sending messages.\n\nA mouse is a device that sends messages to the computer that says \"move this way\", and the computer moves the mouse to where the mouse is pointing.\n\nMonitors are display objects that have a cursor that moves around and shows you where the mouse is pointing.", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Here's a simple way to get around this problem. First, the camera needs to be placed in the right position so that the actor's head is within the field of view. Then, the actor needs to look directly into the camera. If the camera is placed too high, or if the actor is looking down, the image will be cut off by the mirror. If the camera is too low, the actor will be looking up and the image will be cut off by the ceiling. Finally, the actor needs to look directly at the camera, rather than off to the side or up at the ceiling.

Why?\n\nAssistant: It's a well-known fact that food tastes better when it's cooked by a stranger.  This is why 5-star chefs are so successful.  It's also why 7-star chefs are able to charge $300 for a bowl of soup.  It's a scientifically proven fact.\n\nThe restaurant has a lot of money to spend on things that are actually important to you, like the atmosphere, the ambience, the waitstaff, the food,  the water, the plates, the table, the utensils,", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The image you see on your retina is actually blurred because the image you see is upside down.

What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are two main factors that determine how many cars a train can pull: 1. The number of locomotives and 2. The maximum train weight. In the United States, the maximum train weight is currently 250,000 pounds (113,396 kg). This is the weight of the locomotive plus the weight of the cars. However, this weight is not constant and varies by region and by the type of track the train is running on. A typical 5,000-ton train will have a locomotive and 54 cars.

How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The LHC is a particle accelerator that attempts to answer the question of why there is so much more matter than antimatter in the universe. Antimatter is a hypothetical form of matter with the same mass as matter but an opposite charge and spin.\n\nThe LHC is also trying to answer the question of why the universe is so much more orderly than it should be given the chaotic nature of quantum mechanics. The LHC is trying to determine if the universe is fundamentally orderly or chaotic.\n\nThe LHC is also trying to answer the question of why we can see so", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many differences between left and right political parties. Left political parties are often more focused on equality and the distribution of resources and income. Right political parties are often more focused on individualism and personal freedom. Some left political parties are more focused on socialism and others are more focused on communism. There are also many differences in the way that each political party organizes their political system. Some political parties, like the Democratic Party, are more focused on the democratic process and use a direct democracy. Other political parties, like the Communist Party, are more focused on the authoritarian system and use an autocr", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: It seems like the way you experience time is a function of how fast you move and the gravitational forces of the location you are in. The theory is that time passes faster the faster you move, so if you travel to a location that is more distant from the sun, time will pass slower. It's not a matter of distance in the galaxy, but of the gravitational force of that location in the galaxy. If the gravitational force is stronger, then time will pass slower. This is the idea of time dilation.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There is no exact answer to this question, because it\u2019s based on the human factor, which is always changing. But it\u2019s a good question. The international metrology convention, which is the official organization that decides how the meter is measured, is very careful about changing the length of the meter because it\u2019s supposed to be a constant. They\u2019ve been using the same definition of the meter since 1983, so it\u2019s been around for a long time. And it\u2019s based on the distance light travels in a vacuum in a specific amount of time, which is", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many examples of things that seem like no big deal as an adult but are very painful when you are little. In general, we learn to be more careful when we are older, and this helps to avoid painful things. There are also many things that seem painful when we are little but become less painful as we get older. For example, getting a shot is much less painful for adults than it is for a child. The reason for this is that we have more nerve cells in our brains as we get older, and these nerve cells help us to learn to be less sensitive to pain", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Scientists have found hundreds of planets beyond the solar system, but they have not yet confirmed the existence of a ninth planet in our own solar system. The reason is because they are too far away. The best current theory is that a planet as large as Jupiter has been captured by the sun's gravity and orbits inside the planetary orbits of Mercury and Venus. But it's very difficult to detect, and so far, no one has seen it.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Cannibalism is not necessarily bad for a species. It can help regulate a population. A study of black widow spiders found that mating cannibalism can be beneficial to a species. The study found that in some cases, the males eat the female after mating in order to delay the development of the eggs. This delay helps the female live longer and increases the number of offspring that she is able to produce.", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The seeds of fruits are dispersed by animals because they are not only tasty but also have a large amount of energy and can be easily digested. There are many fruits that have seeds that are not tasty to animals, such as cucumbers, tomatoes and melons, so these fruits are not usually eaten by animals. The seeds of fruits that have high energy, such as bananas, apples and oranges, are usually tasty to animals, and they are usually eaten by animals. The seeds of fruits with high energy, such as", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: Product placement in movies is when a company or product is featured in a movie. It can be explicit, for example, when a character uses a product in the film, or it can be implicit, when a character is seen wearing a branded T-shirt or using a branded smartphone. The exact details of how much a company pays for product placement vary by the movie and the company. For example, in 2019, a single product placement in the movie  Captain America: Civil War cost $250,000.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: I believe you are referring to the Cyprus conflict which began in 1974. The Greek military junta attempted to remove the government of the Republic of Cyprus. This was a violation of the Treaty of Guarantee of the Republic of Cyprus by Greece, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. Turkey then invaded the island of Cyprus, and the Republic of Cyprus was forced to declare independence. \n\nThe United Nations Security Council imposed a ceasefire in 1974. The UN has since been involved in efforts to achieve a settlement of the conflict", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children.

The Ice Man is 5,300 years old.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are several different factors that can affect the differences between males and females. For example, species such as lions and humans have sexual differences between males and females because they have sexes. In this case, the reason for the differences between the sexes is the fact that they have different sexes.\n\nAnother example is that the body size of humans is different from the body size of lions. In this case, the reason for the differences between the sexes is that they have different body sizes.\n\nThere are also some differences between the sexes of humans and lions that are not the result of sex differences", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: The amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet depends on the number of bits of information sent.  The maximum number of bits of information that can be sent through your cable internet depends on your internet bandwidth.  The more bits of information that are sent through your cable internet, the slower the internet speed.\n\nThe number of bits of information that can be sent through your cable internet also depends on the number of people using the internet.  If the number of people using the internet is large, the number of bits of information that can be sent through your cable internet is smaller.  The more people using the internet", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Before alarm clocks, people woke up at a certain time by sleeping in certain hours.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: I think the problem is that the coin flip is not 100% independent from the previous flips. It is a sequence of coin flips that are dependent on the previous flips.", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun works by emitting a signal that is detected by a photodiode in the barrel of the gun. When the gun is pointed at the screen, a signal is emitted. The signal is detected by the photodiode.

If you're convicted of DUI, then you're convicted of a crime. If you're involved in a car accident that results in death, you're convicted of manslaughter. If you're convicted of manslaughter, you're going to prison.", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: one another has been used since the 14th century, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). It was originally a plural form of one another, which was also used as a plural noun.\n\nIn the OED, one another was first recorded as a singular noun in 1362, in the Middle English text Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, in which it appears as \u201cI shal noon other, & I shal noon other.\u201d", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: The plastic bolts and wing nuts are made out of a material that doesn't corrode, so they will still be secure and securely attached to the seat 10 years from now.

The immune system, which is the body's defense system, fights the virus. It also helps the body to recover from the disease. The immune system is always active in fighting the viruses. But sometimes the immune system may not be strong enough to fight off the virus. In that case, the virus may kill the person. However, sometimes the immune system may be able to fight off the virus and the person may recover from the disease.", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: For many people, it's because they don't have a routine. For example, if you eat the same meal at the same time each day, you'll get into a routine and it will be easier to wake up in the morning. Also, if you go to bed and get up at the same time every day, you'll get into a routine and it will be easier to wake up in the morning.\n\nIf you have a morning routine, it'll be easier to wake up in the morning. For example, if you have a routine of doing yoga in the morning,", "\n\nHuman: Why do pupils dilate on drugs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pupils dilate on drugs because the body produces more of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which causes the pupil to enlarge.

What's up with that? Are the rules different for that part of the body?\n\nEDIT: What the hell? Ads about hair products started showing on reddit. Ads do get smarter. \n\nAssistant: There are two main reasons why men go bald. The first is male pattern baldness, which is genetic and the most common reason for male baldness. The second is hair loss due to medical conditions, such as  hair loss caused by a hormonal imbalance, stress, or an autoimmune disorder.\n\nThere is no specific age when men start going bald, but most men start going bald in their early twenties.

Some people are more \"regular\" than others, and it's all about how often you go.  Your body gets used to how much you poop, and it becomes a natural rhythm.  You also need to consider what you eat.  If you eat food that has a lot of fiber, your digestive system can help move things along.

The classes of grammars are listed below.", "\n\nHuman: why almost every japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children\n\nI have just noticed this trend tbh and i never wondered why this was. It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: I think that the reason why almost every anime have the main characters as children is because that it makes the story more relatable. It is like when you read a book and you want to connect to the story so you imagine yourself as the main character. In the same way, when you are watching an anime you want to connect to the story so you imagine yourself as the main character. In that way, when you imagine yourself as the main character, you are more likely to like the story. If you are a child then you are more likely to like the story.

If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The idea of hibernation is that the animal can spend the winter in a state of deep sleep, not using much energy. This allows the animal to conserve energy during the winter when food is scarce. Hibernation is not an absolute state of sleep. The animal can wake up from hibernation if it is necessary to hunt for food. In some species, they are able to wake up from hibernation and move around. In others, they are in a state of deep sleep. How they recover so quickly is that they have a very low metabolism, so they are able to survive", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A language is made up of words, and words are made up of letters.  Words are easy to learn, but letters are harder to learn.  Words are also easier to forget than letters.  So, learning words is easier than learning letters.  In addition, learning a language involves learning many words, and the more words you learn, the harder it is to forget them.  So, the more words you learn, the harder it is to forget them.  Learning words is therefore easier than learning letters.  But, learning words is easier than speaking them.  Therefore, speaking is harder than learning.", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: Blind people can feel braille signs by reading the text with their fingers.

Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a good question, and it's a reasonable one to ask. The Vietnam War was a controversial conflict, and it's still debated by historians and the public today. It's not an easy topic to understand, and it's not an easy thing to answer. The war was controversial for many reasons, but one of the most important was the draft. The draft was used to conscript young men into the US military, and it was very controversial. In fact, the draft was the topic of protests and demonstrations throughout the war, and it was the focus of intense", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: A Neanderthal genome sequence has been published. That's a good start. To bring a Neanderthal back, you'd need to first find a Neanderthal skeleton. Then, you'd need to sequence the genome of that individual. Next, you'd need to find a modern human that is related to the Neanderthal. Then, you'd need to find a modern human that is related to you. Then, you'd need to find a modern human that is related to the Neanderthal.

Some of them are successful, and some are not. There are many factors that determine how successful a business is. The location of the business is one factor, and the number of competitors in the area is another. It's also important to consider the market for the products the business sells. For example, if a business sells a product that is in high demand, it can be successful in any location. If a product is in low demand, the business will need to find a location where it can attract a lot of customers.", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Cooking shrimp turns it orange because the proteins in shrimp are more fragile than those in red meat. When shrimp is cooked, the proteins break down and produce a large amount of amino acids. When the amino acids are exposed to the air, they react with oxygen to produce a variety of compounds, including the color compound carotenoid. Shrimp also contains large amounts of the pigment astaxanthin, which produces a red color when oxidized. The red color of cooked meat is due to the presence of heme, which", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: It cannot do anything because it has no idea of what to do when you divide something by zero.\n\nIt is a human error and not a computer error.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because fast food is more convenient and more easily available than \"natural\" food.

And if it is not a member of the set of all sets that are not themselves members of any set, then it is a member of the set of all sets that are not themselves members of", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: Iranian transsexuals are treated as third gender. In Iran, there is no third gender, but they treat transsexuals as third gender. In Iran, third gender is the same as Hijra in India, and is treated as a third gender. Hijras in India are not treated as third gender, and it is very difficult to get any legal recognition.\n\nThere is no legal recognition in Iran, but people are treated in a more friendly manner. It's a cultural thing, and they have more respect for them.\n\nI think the reason Iran is more friendly to transsexuals is because they treat trans", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine?

If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: The most obvious answer is to prevent trucks from getting stuck. The height of the overpass is the height of the legal maximum for a semi-trailer. The only way for a semi to pass under the overpass is to reduce its height to 13 feet 6 inches, which is the legal height of a standard trailer. \n\nAnother answer is that trucks are not the only type of vehicle that might be too tall. Even if you are in a car, if you are too tall, you will not be able to pass under the overpass.", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly.

One of the most important reasons is that we have the ability to rationalize that the animal is not dangerous to us. The other reason is that we have a strong emotional connection with these animals, as well as a strong sense of empathy for them. Many people have a strong sense of empathy for the wild animals that are cute, and they are able to recognize that the animal is just a young animal that has not yet learned how to survive in the wild. This is especially true for animals that are", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a system that transmits both electrical power and data on a single standard Ethernet cable. PoE is used for powering IP phones, wireless access points, IP cameras, and other devices that require power and connectivity. This eliminates the need for an extra power cable and a separate Ethernet cable, and simplifies the installation process.\n\n\n\nPoE is based on the IEEE 802.3af and IEEE 802.3at standards. The IEEE 802.3af standard provides a", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We can see colours because we have three types of cones in our retina: L, M and S cones. The L cones are most sensitive to light, while the S cones are most sensitive to colours. The M cones are in between. S cones are most sensitive to red light and least sensitive to green and blue light. M cones are most sensitive to green light and least sensitive to red and blue light. L cones are most sensitive to blue light and least sensitive to red and green light. We can see colours because our brain uses the information from the S and M cones to create our", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 3rd world countries are so underdeveloped because they have a lack of natural resources, which is the key to any successful economy. In addition to that, 3rd world countries are often underdeveloped due to political instability, which prevents the countries from becoming more developed.", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: Because the government is not a private company. They have to share information with other government agencies and they also have to share information with private companies and the public. The government is not allowed to keep the information to themselves.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: The cut vegetables release water because of the salt. Salt is a good solvent and it dissolves the water in the vegetables. This water release is known as \"cooking off\", as it is the same process that takes place in cooking. When you cut the vegetables, you make the surface area of the vegetables exposed to the air, so the water will evaporate from the surface. If you add salt, the process will accelerate because the water will be dissolved in the salt and the salt will draw the water from the surface.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The skin is actually made up of two layers. The outer layer of the skin is called the epidermis. The epidermis is made up of cells called keratinocytes. These cells are constantly being replaced by new cells, but the cells on the outermost layer of the skin, which is called the stratum corneum, are constantly being lost. The stratum corneum is where the wrinkles are formed. The inner layer of the skin is called the dermis. The dermis is made up of cells called fibroblasts. The fibroblasts are constantly being replaced by new cells", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The Apollo astronauts left equipment on the Moon, but the orbiting telescopes can't see it because it is too far away. Our land based telescopes can see the equipment because it is closer to us. Light travels at a finite speed, and the Moon is about a 1/6th of the distance to the Sun, so the light from the Moon takes about 1/6th as long to get to Earth as the light from the Sun.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water is the primary component of the human body. As such, it is essential to a healthy human body. Drinking a liquid that contains water, such as a liquid containing water and sugar or water and caffeine, dehydrates the body because the liquid is not replenishing the water that is lost to the body. Drinking water replenishes the water lost by the body.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hispanic and Latino are both ethnicities and cultural identities. Hispanic refers to people who have ancestral roots in Spain, Latin America, or the Caribbean. Latino is a term used by many people in the United States to describe people from Hispanic countries. The term Latino is used by many because it encompasses a wide variety of people with different ethnicities and cultural identities. While both terms are used interchangeably, they do not mean the same thing.", "\n\nHuman: Why do different countries have different outlets?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the United States, most outlets have 2 or 3 holes.

Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many reasons to separate the washing and drying processes. First, washing and drying are different processes with different requirements. For example, washing requires heat to remove dirt and water, while drying requires heat to remove water and air to remove heat. Second, the machines used for washing and drying are different. For example, the washing machine uses a wash basin to hold the water and a spinning drum to rotate the water and dirt. The drying machine uses a drum to hold the air. These two machines are different in terms of design and performance.

This fat is not digested and becomes a source of energy for the body. After eating, the body will use the energy to do other things, such as breathing, drinking, digesting, and walking, and the body will use less energy to digest the fat in the stomach or intestines. This results in a temporary decrease in the amount of energy available to digest food. If we do not use the restroom, the stomach and intest", "\n\nHuman: How and why did Pokemon win the popularity contest against Digimon?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pokemon has a much larger fanbase and a more diverse and larger fanbase.
