Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: They release water because they are releasing their osmotic pressure. Osmotic pressure is a term that describes the pressure exerted by a solvent (in this case, water) on a solute (in this case, the salt). When the solute is in a solution (in this case, the water), it will try to diffuse to the other side of the solution to try to get to a lower concentration. This is called osmosis. When the concentration of the solute is higher on one side, it will try to diffuse to the side with a lower concentration to try to reach equilibrium", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Aha, I see.

It can also dissolve some other substances, such as sugar.  It is also a solvent, because it can dissolve other substances, such as oil.
