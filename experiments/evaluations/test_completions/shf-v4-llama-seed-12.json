It is possible to throw a dart at any point on the number line, so the probability of hitting a rational number is 1. The probability of hitting an irrational number is 0, since there is no point on the number line where an irrational number exists.", "\n\nHuman: ELI5: how can babies in the womb spend weeks to months upside down without issue but any person outside of a womb would experience effects or even death in less than a few days?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a few different factors that go into this, the main one is that the human body has many different systems that work together to keep the human body balanced. The human body has systems for maintaining the correct levels of blood pressure, blood sugar, and temperature. The human body also has systems to maintain the correct levels of pH, which is the acidity or alkalinity of the blood.

What made computers like the Cray so large and expensive, and have the features that they were designed to provide been shrunk and mass-produced with our technological progression?\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the explanations y'all.\n\nAssistant: It's all about the architecture.  The Cray was built on a very different architecture than the i7.  The i7 is based on a single processor, and the Cray was based on a parallel architecture.  A parallel architecture is an architecture that is designed to take advantage of multiple processors, and to distribute the workload between multiple processors.  The Cray was designed to take advantage of this architecture, and it did it very well.  The i7, on the other hand, is not designed to take advantage of this architecture, and as such is not as powerful as the Cray", "\n\nHuman: why do milk alternatives [soy almond etc] get called milk and not *name* water?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: milk is made from cows, soy milk is made from soy beans.

As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: The egg is a membrane enclosing a yolk, surrounded by a hard white. When you boil an egg, the water molecules in the egg membrane move to the outside of the egg, making the membrane more rigid. The egg white is mostly protein. When you boil the egg, the proteins in the egg white denature (their structure changes), making the egg white soft. The proteins in the egg white are mostly made up of amino acids, which are small molecules that have a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other end.

Calcium oxalate crystals are also found in certain fruits and vegetables, such as rhubarb and spinach. These foods are high in oxalate, which is a natural substance that is found in many foods. When too much oxalate is present in the urine, the crystals can form stones.

How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The box office is the revenue generated by the film at the box office. The amount that the film costs to make and distribute is the budget. The budget is not the amount that the film makes at the box office. The budget is the amount that the film is expected to make at the box office.

I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: The cancer rate for livestock is very low. Cancer is an abnormal growth of cells that occurs when the body's cells do not grow or die as they should. Cancer cells can grow into tumors. Tumors may be cancerous or benign. Cancerous tumors are malignant, meaning they can invade and destroy normal tissue. Benign tumors are not cancerous and do not invade or destroy normal tissue.

My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth are caused when the enamel on your teeth wears down. This can be caused by aging, brushing too hard, or eating certain foods. Once the enamel wears down, the dentin is exposed, which is the part of your tooth that contains the nerves. This can cause your teeth to hurt when you eat or drink something cold or hot. You can prevent sensitive teeth by using a soft-bristled toothbrush, using fluoride toothpaste, and seeing your dentist regularly for dental checkups.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: Hair is dead cells and proteins that are held together by a protein called keratin. Keratin is made up of amino acids.  The amino acids are held together by hydrogen bonds.  When hair gets greasy, it is because the oil and sebum in the scalp bind to the hair strands and the hydrogen bonds break, causing the hair to feel \"greasy\".  Shampoo is a mixture of sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, and sodium laureth sulfate.

Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely you know the position of an object, the less precisely you can know its momentum, and vice versa. In other words, if you know the position of an object very precisely, you cannot know its momentum, and vice versa.\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is an extension of the more general Uncertainty Principle that was first derived by Werner Heisenberg.

All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a term used in many fields of science, including physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology. It refers to a lag in response, or a delay in reacting to a stimulus. Hysteresis is the difference between the current and the previous value of a variable.\n\nHysteresis is important because it means that when the current value of a variable changes, the past history of the variable affects the current value of the variable.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Calories are a measurement of energy.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: The amount of information that can be sent through the wire is limited by the speed of the signal.  The speed of the signal is limited by the speed of light.  The speed of light is 186,000 miles per second, so the speed of a signal through the wire is also 186,000 miles per second.  The speed of light is the maximum speed for any signal.  Therefore, the maximum amount of information that can be sent through the wire is also limited by the speed of light.

A cloud is made of tiny droplets of water or ice that are suspended in the air. Clouds are formed when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into tiny droplets.
