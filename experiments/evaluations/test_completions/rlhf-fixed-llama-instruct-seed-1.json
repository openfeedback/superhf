How did he get a 15 million euro bonus from Nokia when the company lost 15 billion under his control?\n\nAccording his wiki \" During the 3 years Elop was Nokia CEO, Nokia revenues fell 40%, Nokia profits fell 95%, Nokia market share collapsed in smartphones from 34% to 3.4%, Nokia's credit rating went from A to junk, Nokia's share price dropped 60% in value and Nokia's market capitalization lost 13 Billion dollars in value. The Financial Times calculated that Nokia shareholders ended up paying Elop a bonus of 1 million Euros for every 1.5 billion in market capital that Elop was able to destroy while Nokia CEO.\"\n\nI must have zero understanding of how bonuses are supposed to work. This guy is one example, but there are many others. \n\nAssistant: Bonuses are supposed to be based on how well a company performs. Nokia lost 15 billion in market cap under Elop's leadership, yet he was still able to get a bonus of 15 million euros. \n\nIf I were a shareholder, I would have fired Elop and sued him for the bonuses he received based on the terrible performance of Nokia. I would have also sued the board of Nokia for not firing him. \n\nIn a competitive industry such as technology, a company cannot just give bonuses to a CEO regardless of how", "\n\nHuman: Does a charge of attempted murder include all of the crimes that go into the attempt?\n\nIf you say try to murder someone by kidnapping them, beating them up and then stabbing them several times, is the kidnapping and beating and stabbing included in the attempted murder charge or are all actions charged in addition to the attempted murder?\n\nHow does the law handle that?\n\nAssistant: Attempted murder is a specific charge in some jurisdictions that requires the state to prove that you attempted to commit the murder. It is a very serious charge and can carry a life sentence.\n\nAttempted murder is charged in addition to any other charges that might be brought if you actually commit the murder. The reason for this is that it is a separate charge. It is not a lesser charge than murder. It is a separate charge that requires the state to prove that you tried to commit the murder.\n\nIf you are convicted of attempted murder, you will likely be sentenced to life in prison.", "\n\nHuman: What are the functional differences between a Cray super computer and my 2.7GHz i7 desktop?\n\nI know technology has advanced to a point where I can buy for $500 a device with more computing power than anything built in say, 1990.  What made computers like the Cray so large and expensive, and have the features that they were designed to provide been shrunk and mass-produced with our technological progression?\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the explanations y'all.\n\nAssistant: The Cray supercomputer was developed in 1976 to meet the needs of scientific and engineering applications. It was designed to process large amounts of data and solve problems with high complexity. In general, the performance of a supercomputer is measured by the number of operations per second (OPS) and the number of calculations per second (CPS).

Others are conscious, controlled by the brain. It is difficult to control autonomic functions, because they are not under direct control of the brain. \n\nThe autonomic nervous system controls all automatic functions in the body, such as breathing, digestion, heart rate, blood pressure, and so on. These functions are called involuntary or autonomic, because the person cannot control them voluntarily. \n\nIn contrast, the conscious or voluntary nervous system controls voluntary functions, such as eye movements, muscle movement,", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The body naturally produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. Sunlight contains ultraviolet (UV) light, which is a type of radiation. The UV light from sunlight that is absorbed by the skin aids in the production of vitamin D. Vitamin D is a group of related fat-soluble compounds, which includes vitamin D-1, also known as cholecalciferol, and vitamin D-2, also known as ergocalciferol. Vitamin D-1 is produced in the skin when UV light from sunlight is absorbed", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The flickering of the LEDs in a video may be caused by either a) the camera or b) the lighting or c) the video compression.

When two coils of wire are close together, they interact with each other, and if the magnetic field of one of the coils changes, the other coil will also experience a change. \n\nThe coils are usually arranged in a way that the magnetic field of one coil is perpendicular to the magnetic field of the other coil. \n\nWhen the coil with the changing magnetic field is connected to a battery, the coil with the magnetic field that is perpendicular to the changing magnetic field is called the secondary", "\n\nHuman: What are sensitive teeth? My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth are teeth that are extremely sensitive to cold, sweet, sour, or hot foods or beverages. If you experience sensitivity, you may have receding gums, an exposed root, a cracked tooth, or a cavity. It is important to see a dentist to find out the cause of your tooth sensitivity, since it may indicate a more serious problem. There are also home treatments that can help relieve tooth sensitivity.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: The hair's oil is made up of a waxy substance called sebum. Sebum is produced by the sebaceous glands in your hair follicles. It's secreted onto your scalp and hair shafts, where it mixes with the keratin protein that makes up your hair, forming a lipid layer. The lipid layer is water-repellent and helps protect your hair from damage.\n\nThe lipid layer is the same for everyone, but its thickness depends on the amount of sebum your scalp produces. The lipid layer is a combination of a", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, is a law passed by the United States Congress in 1993 that was intended to protect the religious rights of individuals. The law states that the government \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion,\n\\item unless the government demonstrates that it has a compelling interest in doing so and\n\\item it is the least restrictive means of achieving that compelling interest.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe RFRA was passed in response to the United States", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry is a theoretical symmetry that is conjectured to exist in nature, and that is also a property of certain mathematical models.

The evidence for the existence of ghosts comes from what people have seen and experienced. This is called anecdotal evidence, and it can be very useful in understanding a phenomenon.\n\nAnecdotal evidence, however, is not reliable enough to convince a scientist to accept the existence of ghosts. For example, the anecdotal evidence of a person seeing a ghost in their house might not be enough to convince a scientist that ghosts are real. The person might have been dreaming, or they might have", "\n\nHuman: Why are peanuts so much more affordable than other nuts?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Peanuts are more affordable because they are grown in the United States, where production costs are lower than those of nuts that are grown in foreign countries. Additionally, they are more profitable than other nuts because peanut butter is a staple food in American households. This makes peanuts a versatile snack that can be easily incorporated into many meals. Furthermore, peanuts can be grown with minimal labor requirements, making them a highly efficient crop. Peanuts are also more resilient than many other nuts, and can grow in a variety of climates and soil", "\n\nHuman: How do compression shorts and compression tights help athletes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Compression shorts and compression tights are worn by athletes to reduce muscle vibration and muscle damage, reduce swelling and reduce muscle soreness. \nCompression shorts and compression tights are worn during or after physical activities such as running or lifting weights.

You might also experience muscle spasms and pain. Pain can also be a result of tissue damage caused by overstretching. Pain can also be a result of tissue damage caused by overstretching. The most common type of back injury is a muscle strain or sprain. This is caused when you overextend your back and cause a muscle or ligament to pull. Pain and stiffness can be caused by a bulging or herniated", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: The exchange rate between two currencies is the number of units of one currency that you need to exchange for one unit of another currency. For example, if the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Japanese yen is 110 yen per $1, you would need to exchange 110 yen to buy $1. The exchange rate between two currencies can fluctuate because the supply of one currency can increase or decrease more than the supply of the other. For example, if the supply of Japanese yen increases, the Japanese yen becomes more valuable, which means that fewer yen are needed", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hippies had a lot of money from the baby boom, and the government had just ended the Vietnam War, so they were able to travel cross country with the money they had saved up and the money they had made from the war. The hippie lifestyle was cheap because they didn't need to pay for a lot of things, they could just live off the land and they could work a little bit to get money for food. They didn't need to pay for rent, because they were living in the woods. They could work for food, or they could work for money to buy food. They", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: It is because of the Earth's rotation.\n\nThe Earth spins around an axis that is tilted at an angle to the orbit plane.\nWhen the Earth rotates on its axis, it takes 24 hours for the planet to complete a single rotation.\nSince the Earth revolves around the Sun, the length of the day is not constant. During the day, the Earth rotates in the same direction as it revolves around the Sun. This means that the rotation of the Earth is faster than the revolution.\nThe Earth's rotation is the cause for the night and day.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers are made of hardware and software. Hardware is the physical components such as chips, RAM, and hard drives. Software is the code that runs the hardware. \n\nHardware and software are made by humans, and are therefore fallible. As hardware and software evolve, they become more and more reliable, and are able to handle more and more complex tasks. As more hardware and software are developed, it becomes easier to build new hardware and software, and the cycle repeats.\n\nIn addition, there are many companies that specialize in building hardware and software. These companies compete", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It is because calculators do not have enough precision to represent the number 10^99. 10^99 is a very large number. For example, if we use a 32-bit system, there are only 4 billion numbers 0-9 that a calculator can represent.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: A lot of foods contain fiber, which is a carbohydrate that is digested by your body. When you don\u2019t chew your food enough, you don\u2019t swallow the fiber, which stays in your digestive system and gets fermented. The bacteria in your colon ferment this food and produce gas, which is what causes the stinky farts. If you chew your food thoroughly, the fiber is broken down and absorbed by your body and does not cause gas.\n\nThere are several ways to prevent gas. You can eat smaller", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: A medication can be tasted when pushed through an IV because it is dissolved in the fluid and some medications contain a preservative that can cause the taste. The taste can be mild or strong, depending on the medication.", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that if you are trying to measure a system with a large momentum (mass, energy) then you can not also measure the position of the system with the same accuracy. \n\nIf you try to measure the momentum of a particle, then you also must make a measurement of the position. \n\nBut if you make a measurement of the position, then you change the momentum of the particle. \n\nSo if you try to measure the position of a particle with high momentum, then the position can not be measured with high accuracy. \n\nThis is a fundamental limitation", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a phenomenon where the change of one quantity depends on the history of another quantity. \n\nHysteresis is often observed when an object or system is impacted by a change in one quantity, but the effect of that change is delayed. \n\nIn physics, hysteresis is a change in one quantity that depends on the history of another quantity. \n\nFor example, a hysteretic material is one where the stress depends on the history of the strain, and the strain depends on the history of the stress. \n\nHysteresis is often", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

The way I see it, a label is a company that acts as a middleman between bands and record companies. Labels are a way for bands to get their music heard by a larger audience, and to get signed to a major record company. Labels are also a way for record companies to \nfind new bands and to keep up with current trends. Indie labels are slightly different from major labels, in that they are usually smaller, and have a more hands-on approach to the bands they work with.

What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In this analogy, a train pulls a car that is attached to another car that is attached to another car, and so on. Each car is connected to the next car by a long rope. The car that is connected to the first car is connected to the second car by a shorter rope, and so on. At the end of the train, the car is connected to the car by a rope that is much shorter than the length of the train. The train pulls the train in the same way that you pull a rope. If the train pulls on the rope, the rope pulls", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 1. Ancient texts and artifacts are translated using the same methods we use to translate modern texts and artifacts. A key difference is that ancient texts and artifacts often do not contain modern references, such as dates, names, and place names, and so must be translated using information from other sources. If the ancient text or artifact contains a reference to a modern text or artifact, it may help to provide a translation of that reference.\n\n2. The translation of ancient texts and artifacts is often done by experts in the field of the artifact or text. For example, the translation of ancient Egyptian hierog", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Water is a solvent, and it draws out the volatile \n\nOrganic molecules from the surfaces it touches. These molecules are then released into the air.\n\nWet surfaces also have a higher surface area than dry ones. So, more molecules are in contact with the air.\n\nThe molecules in the air that are released from wet surfaces have a lower molecular weight than those that come from dry surfaces. So, the molecules are more \n\nDiffuse and are able to travel farther from the source. This is why wet surfaces smell so much stronger than dry ones", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's most powerful particle accelerator.

While most countries have two parties on the left-right spectrum, some countries have more than two. \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Left-wing parties are also known as progressive parties, socialist parties, democratic parties, and liberal parties. They believe that the government should have a strong role in addressing social and economic issues. They favor a more progressive tax system, and they tend", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The way that you experience time on Earth is determined by a number of factors. One of the most important is the distance that light travels in a year. If you travel far away from the Sun, the light that you receive from the Sun will be dimmer, and it will take more time for that light to reach you. As a result, you will experience a longer year, and you will age more slowly than someone who is farther from the Sun.\n\nThis is a very good question. If you could travel far away from the Sun, you would find that a year on Earth would be much longer than a", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: \\textbf{The meter is defined as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 second}.\n\nThis definition is based on a definition of the second, the International System of Units (SI), the metric system of measurement. The meter is the SI unit of length.\n\nThe meter was originally defined as the length of the French\\noun \n\"\\textbf{metre}\", a unit of length, which is defined by the distance between two lines on a bar made of an alloy of platinum", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The pain caused by a soap in the eye is due to the reaction of the chemicals on the surface of the eye, such as the cornea and conjunctiva, and the chemicals in the soap. When you are a child, the cornea and conjunctiva are more sensitive to these chemicals, and the pain is more noticeable. As you get older, the chemicals in the soap may also affect the other tissues that are present in the eye, such as the lens and retina, but these tissues are also more resistant to the chemicals in the soap, and the pain is less", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The search for a ninth planet has been a long and difficult one.

The link is a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that tells the browser what protocol to use and where to find the file.\n\nIf the document is stored locally on the computer, then the browser can open it directly. If the document is stored on a server, then the browser must first connect to the server and fetch the document. This can take time.\n\nThe browser may already be connected to the server, but the connection may be using a different protocol. If the browser is connected to the server using", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: Horses are large animals and are used to running and being physically active. They require a certain amount of physical exercise to stay fit and healthy. Horses that are injured or become sick often are unable to exercise. If a horse is prevented from exercising, it will not be able to recover. As a result, horses are often euthanized when they are injured or sick.\n\nHorses are also often used in events such as rodeo, polo, horse racing, and other sports. These events are very physically demanding for horses. Horses that are injured during", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The history of Cyprus is complex and difficult to summarize. The island has a long history of division and conflict. The island was first divided by the British in 1923. In 1955, the British and the Turkish government agreed to a partition of the island. The island was divided into two, the Greek Cypriots in the south and the Turkish Cypriots in the north. This partition was not accepted by the Greek Cypriots. In 1959, the Greek Cypriots declared independence from the British.

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: I'm sure you already know that the penalty for killing someone with a car depends on how you get charged, but it can be a felony, a misdemeanor, or an accident.  It is very rare that someone gets convicted of killing someone while driving, but if they do, they could face 25 years in prison.  However, if you were drunk at the time, it could be a different story.  The penalty for killing someone while driving drunk is much heavier.  They can face up to 40 years in prison.

The bolt and wing nut combination provides the necessary friction and strength to prevent the seat from falling off the toilet. Metal bolts and wing nuts are typically used in applications where a lot of force is needed to hold the bolt and wing nut together. For example, metal bolts and wing nuts are used in car wheels. The wheel will have a lot of force pressing down on it which can cause the bolt and wing nut to come loose.", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: Growing up is a complicated process that involves multiple stages and transitions in one\u2019s life.

Is there a biological dofference in their libido?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are two possible reasons for the difference in the number of people who are comfortable with having sex with a stranger. One is that, from an evolutionary perspective, it is in the interest of males to have as many partners as possible. This is because it is in the interest of females to have a partner with as many children as possible.

Some theories include: 1) the amount of food you eat is not always consistent, and 2) the amount of food you eat is not always the same as the amount of water you drink.  When you eat a large amount of food and drink a large amount of water, the water can wash out some of the food, making it easier to pass through your body. This is why you may have to poop more frequently when you drink a lot", "\n\nHuman: What Is the Chomsky Grammar Heirarchy and How Does It Work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Chomsky grammar hierarchy is a formal description of the\ncomplexity of natural language.

If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 1. During the winter, many animals hibernate to escape the cold weather and low food supply. A hibernating animal's body temperature drops from normal to almost the same as the surrounding environment. This is called a state of \"torpor.\" The animal's metabolism slows, and it no longer needs to eat or drink. During this time, the animal's body functions slow down and it doesn't move.\n\n2.

What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In order to attract money from depositors, banks need to offer interest rates that are higher than the rate of inflation. By offering interest rates that are higher than the rate of inflation, the banks are able to attract money from depositors.\n\nInflation is the rise in the prices of goods and services over time. As prices increase over time, the value of money decreases. In order for banks to attract money from depositors, they need to offer interest rates that are higher than the rate of inflation. If a bank\u2019s interest rate is lower than the rate of inflation, depositors will", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The following graph compares the income share of the top 1% of American households to the income share of the bottom 50% of American households over time. The data are taken from the U.S. Congressional Budget Office and the U.S. Census Bureau. The income share of the top 1% is plotted as a percentage of the income share of the bottom 50%. The data for the top 1% are drawn from the CBO's analysis of taxes on capital income, which represent income earned by households with incomes above $195,000.", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge? If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: 1) Freeway overpasses are designed to be able to accommodate all vehicles that travel on the freeway. The overpasses are typically designed to allow vehicles with heights of 16 feet or more to travel under the overpass safely. 2) The sign height is typically used to designate the maximum height of the overpass. 3) This allows vehicles traveling on the freeway to safely determine if they can safely pass under the overpass. 4) If the vehicle height is greater than the maximum height of the overpass, then the vehicle will need to be lowered", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly.

This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: * Sound is a wave that travels at a speed of 340 m/s in air. When the air temperature drops, the air is less dense, and sound travels through it more slowly.\n* The same applies to the speed of sound in water. As the temperature drops, the water gets denser, and sound travels through it more slowly.\n* Sound travels at a different speed in solids, because there are other molecules to bump into.\n\nWhen the temperature drops, the air becomes less dense. This means that there are fewer molecules per unit", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: The correlation between education and liberalism is well-known.\n\nEducation is correlated with income, which is correlated with political orientation.\n\nPeople who are more educated are more likely to vote for Democrats.\n\nHowever, there is also a correlation between income and political orientation.\n\nPeople who are wealthier are more likely to vote for Republicans.\n\nEducation is also correlated with wealth.\n\nTherefore, the correlation between education and political orientation is likely driven by the correlation between education and wealth.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that people who are wealth", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Adele has a strong accent because she is from the British Isles, but when she sings, her vocal tract is resonated by a very low frequency vowel sound. This allows her to use a much higher pitch than she could without the vowel resonance.\n\nAdele is using a low pitched vowel resonance to allow her to sing higher pitches. The pitch of the vowel is determined by the frequency of the sound produced in the vocal tract. The higher the vowel frequency, the higher the pitch.\n\nAn example of an English vowel is the vowel [a", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The shape of the cloud is determined by the winds in the atmosphere. Wind is created by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface, which causes air to move from warm to cold regions. The movement of air also creates pressure differences that change the shape of the clouds. In addition to wind, the shape of the cloud is determined by the shape of the cloud itself.\n\nWhen a cloud is blown by the wind, its shape is changed by the wind to match the shape of the cloud. This is called \naerodynamic drag. The wind force is proportional to the speed of the wind and", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: The lifespan of an organism is related to its size. It is also related to the rate at which the organism reproduces. The smaller an organism is, the faster it grows and the faster it reproduces. This is because smaller organisms have a higher metabolic rate, which means they require more energy to grow and reproduce. As a result, they tend to have a shorter lifespan than larger organisms. The larger an organism is, the slower it grows and reproduces. The slower metabolic rate of large organisms allows them to live longer than smaller organisms. This is because", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The word \"mom\" is a shortened version of the word \"mother,\" and \"dad\" is a shortened version of the word \"father.\" Mom and dad are terms of endearment that we use to express our love and respect for our parents.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are the numbers that are significant to the number. For example, the number 25.75 has two significant digits. It is significant to the number because it is the value of the number, and it is the only number that is 25.\n\nSignificant digits are used in calculations to reduce the number of significant digits that are significant to the number. For example, if you were to add the numbers 22.3 and 3.45, you would not want to include the significant digits of 22.3 and 3.45 because they", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Fats are broken down in the liver. There are two main pathways. One is called the ketogenic pathway, where the fatty acids are oxidized and the energy is released through the production of ketone bodies. The other pathway is called the \u03b2-oxidation pathway, where fatty acids are oxidized and the energy is released through the production of ATP. This pathway involves the participation of enzymes, cofactors, and coenzymes, and is highly regulated. Fatty acids are taken up by the liver", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high pitched ringing you hear when turning on an old TV is called the \nline frequency. This is because the high pitched noise is the same frequency as the \nline running through the center of the screen. The line frequency is the same as the \nline running through the center of the screen. The noise is actually the result of the \nswitching of the TV's high voltage power supply. When the power supply is turned off, \nthe power to the TV is cut off. However, the power supply still needs to have some \npower left to be able to turn off.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A battery is made up of many different chemicals, which act as an electric source. When a battery is first created, there is a lot of energy in the chemicals, which can be used to power a device. However, when the battery is used, the energy in the chemicals is gradually used up, until it is no longer able to power a device. In order to keep the battery working for as long as possible, it is important to ensure that the chemicals are charged up regularly, to keep the chemicals at their fullest.\n\nA battery is made up of many different chemicals, which act as", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

In this theory, the universe was\noriginally extremely small and dense, but it expanded rapidly due to a release of energy. The energy released in the Big Bang was so\ngreat that it was able to expand the universe, which caused it to cool down over time.  The universe was once extremely hot, but it now\ncools slowly. This is because the universe is made up of matter and radiation. Matter cannot travel faster than the speed of light, so when\nmatter and radiation move outward, the speed of", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In music, a bar is a group of beats in a measure. A beat is the basic unit of time in music. In a simple time signature of 4/4, the bar is divided into four beats. The beat is the point in time at which the rhythm of the piece changes. It is usually the strongest sound in a piece of music. The beat is divided into two parts, called a downbeat and an upbeat. The downbeat is the strongest sound in a piece of music.

The show's format was often criticized for being exploitative, and it has been credited with contributing", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: I think that it is because people are naturally empathetic and the more they see of a certain animal the more they can identify with it. It's the same reason why people find it hard to kill something they have seen as a baby. There is a part of our brain that is wired to care about life, and when we see something that we can associate with life, even if it's only a tiny part of it, it's hard to kill.\n\nI think that it's also because of the way we see animals in media. When we see a lion or a tiger in a", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a system that enables the delivery of both electrical power and data over a single Ethernet cable.\nPoE was originally developed by the IEEE 802.3af standard to power low-power devices, such as wireless LAN access points, IP phones, security cameras, and networked sensors.\nPoE can also be used to power higher-power devices, such as network switches, IP video surveillance systems, and IP telephony systems.", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 1.\tA colour is the result of a combination of light wavelengths that are reflected off an object.\n\n2.\tColours are produced by light wavelengths that are reflected off objects and absorbed by our eyes, which\n\n3.\tconvert them into electrical signals that are interpreted by the brain as colours.\n\n4.\tThe three primary colours are red, green and blue.\n\n5.\tThe three secondary colours are yellow, cyan, and magenta.\n\n6.\tThe colour of an object depends on the wavelengths of light that", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Poverty and the lack of capital.

The Internet is not a secure network because it is possible to access information in the Internet without permission. This is the case, for example, with a computer in the Internet that is connected to the government network. In order to access the government network, you need to be authorized, which means that you have a password. However, it is possible to use a special computer program to access the government network without the password, and thus access information without permission.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: This happens because salt draws water from cells. When you cut the cabbage and add salt, the cells are damaged and are no longer able to hold onto the water. Therefore, the water is released into the air, where it can be absorbed by other cells, or it will evaporate.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water causes the skin to lose some of its natural oils. This allows the water to enter the cells more easily. The water may also cause the skin to lose some of its elasticity. When the skin is dried, the oils are reabsorbed by the skin.  The skin will become wrinkly when it is dried, because the skin is less flexible.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Light travels at a speed of 300,000,000 meters per second in a vacuum. Since the Apollo astronauts left equipment on the Moon, it is about 384,400,000 kilometers away from us. If we assume the equipment is 100 centimeters tall, it will take light about 8 seconds to travel the distance from us to it. Since we can't see it, it must not be emitting any light. Therefore, it must be dark. Since it is dark, it must be black.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Drinking a liquid removes water from your body.
