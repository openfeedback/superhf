So, it\u2019s not really true that banks switched from paper money to the system we have today. What they did is they created a system of electronic money that was backed by gold, and that\u2019s where we got the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve was created as a way of regulating the system. Now, the Federal Reserve has two purposes. One of them is to regulate the system of banks and to regulate the money supply, and the other purpose is to provide money to the", "\n\nHuman: Why are there diseases/viruses/etc that harm the human body, but never anything that enhances or improves us?\n\n\n\nAssistant: So the human body is not perfect?", "\n\nHuman: Why is a cup the prize the team/individual gets when they win something instead of the subject related item.

I have been examining the bills closely and the aesthetics are so well done - the combination of security + design is beautiful and it got me to thinking: as new security measures must be taken to prevent counterfeiting, what is the exact design process - intermeshing culture with logistical security?\n\nAssistant: W How do they design Paper Currency?", "\n\nHuman: Why does a word no longer sound like a word after saying it a bunch of times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: You sound like a robot.", "\n\nHuman: What happens when you \"break the seal\" while you have been drinking?\n\nBasically, why does this cause you to go pee every 20 minutes after you go pee the first time?

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: I think it's because the program is still running in the background, though I'm not sure.", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If you have a higher aperture, you are able to reduce the depth of field.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: We have had the same issue with the child labor laws.

I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure.

Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to.
