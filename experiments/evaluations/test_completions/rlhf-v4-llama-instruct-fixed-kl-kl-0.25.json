If the business is public, then the government should set the rules.  However, I would note that the issue gets more complicated if a business serves as a public forum (like a restaurant).  In that case, a business owner should be able to set his own rules.  The reason for this is that public forums are supposed to be open to the public.", "\n\nHuman: So I was reading an article the other day about how the crime rate has exploded at border cities.

If a baby were to spend weeks or months upside down, there would be many issues. For example, the blood would pool in the head, and the head would get larger. The brain would also swell. If the baby were to be born, it would have to spend some time in the hospital, with a chance of brain damage and death. If a person were to be upside down for a few days, it's possible that they could die. But, this isn't the case for babies. Their bodies", "\n\nHuman: How does electromagnetism occur?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Electromagnetism is a type of force that occurs between electrically charged particles. The force between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that the further apart they are, the less force that acts upon them. For example, if two electrons were a distance of one meter apart, the force of electromagnetism would be negligible. However, if the distance between them was reduced to a distance of one-billionth of a meter, the force of electromagnetism would be the strongest force on Earth.\n\nWhen charged particles are moving, they are", "\n\nHuman: Bonuses. Newly appointed head of Xbox is Stephen Elop of Nokia. How did he get a 15 million euro bonus from Nokia when the company lost 15 billion under his control?\n\nAccording his wiki \" During the 3 years Elop was Nokia CEO, Nokia revenues fell 40%, Nokia profits fell 95%, Nokia market share collapsed in smartphones from 34% to 3.4%, Nokia's credit rating went from A to junk, Nokia's share price dropped 60% in value and Nokia's market capitalization lost 13 Billion dollars in value.

This means that if you were beating someone up and stabbing them, you would be charged with both attempted murder and assault. In this case, the two crimes would be separate from each other and would be charged separately. \n\nIn other words, you would be charged with the crime of assault and the crime of attempted murder. The crime of attempted murder would be the charge that would be on your record. The crime of assault would be on the victim's record", "\n\nHuman: What are the functional differences between a Cray super computer and my 2.7GHz i7 desktop?\n\nI know technology has advanced to a point where I can buy for $500 a device with more computing power than anything built in say, 1990.  What made computers like the Cray so large and expensive, and have the features that they were designed to provide been shrunk and mass-produced with our technological progression?\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the explanations y'all.\n\nAssistant: The Cray was designed to have high performance.  The main memory was large, the processors were fast, the interconnection between processors was fast, and the interconnection between processors and main memory was fast.

They are both made up of water, dairy products and fats. Milk alternatives contain no dairy products. They are made up of plant based ingredients and water. Milk is made up of water, lactose, proteins and fats. It is a complete food and is a good source of calcium and other nutrients. The alternative milk is not a complete food, but has the same nutrients as milk.  Milk alternatives can be made from soy, almond, rice,", "\n\nHuman: How come eggs harden when they are boiled while pasta softens?\n\nI searched this question first, and while I found one about eggs hardening, it did not explain the issue regarding pasta. As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: When eggs are boiled, the white and the yolk are heated. The protein in the yolk is denatured, which causes it to become firmer. The proteins in the white are not denatured, which is why it stays soft. The pasta is heated, but not boiled. When it is boiled, it becomes softer. This is because the starches in the pasta are denatured, which causes them to become softer and less firm. This is also why bread gets stale over time, because the starches become denatured. Pasta is", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The situation in Syria has been going on for years.

They contain an anode and a cathode and an electrolyte solution. When a battery is connected to a circuit, the anode and cathode are connected to the positive and negative terminals of the circuit, and electrons can move between the anode and cathode. The chemical reaction between the anode and cathode releases electrons. The anode is connected to the positive terminal, and the cathode is connected to the negative terminal. When a device is connected", "\n\nHuman: Is there such a thing as a perfect circle?\n\nMerriam-Webster defines a circle as \u201ca closed plane curve every point of which is equidistant from a fixed point within the curve.\u201d Is the definition of a circle actually attainable?\n\nAssistant: No, a circle is not attainable. The most that a human being can draw is an arc, which is a part of a circle. If you try to draw a circle, you will be able to draw a line around the circumference of a circle, but the line will never be the same size as the circle that it is intended to represent. Therefore, a perfect circle is not possible.\n\nA perfect circle is also a perfect example of a paradox. A paradox is a statement that seems to be true but is actually false. A paradox is an oxymoron, which is", "\n\nHuman: what's the difference between the blue circle and the check mark and the white circle and the check mark ( on messenger )\n\nI understand that there is a difference between sent and delivered, but what does that difference mean?\n\nAssistant: The blue circle indicates a message has been sent, but not yet delivered. The white circle indicates a message has been delivered.  The blue circle also indicates that the message has not been read by the recipient.  The white circle indicates that the message has been read by the recipient.\n\nThe check mark indicates that the message has been delivered and read by the recipient.

They are usually a combination of calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and uric acid, but can also include other substances.\n\nThe most common type of kidney stones is calcium-based, but they can also be composed of uric acid, cystine, and struvite, which are all naturally occurring minerals. The formation of kidney stones is not a rapid process. The stone may form slowly, over a period of several months or", "\n\nHuman: Do eyes get tired from moving constantly during REM sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This is a common misconception. While people move a lot during REM sleep, this is not the cause of eye fatigue. The eye is a muscle and like any muscle, it gets fatigued with use. This is true for eyes that stay still and eyes that move around. The muscles in the eye are under the control of the brain. The brain has to work harder to control muscles when they are tired than when they are fresh. As a result, the brain must work harder to control the muscles in the eye when they are tired. This causes eye fatigue.\n\nAnother", "\n\nHuman: Why is eye contact so important?\n\nSerious question!\n\nAssistant: Eye contact is an important social cue that is used to show that you are listening to someone and are interested in what they are saying. In many cultures, it is also a sign of respect. When you look someone in the eye, you are saying 'I'm focused on you and I'm interested in what you have to say.' By looking at someone, you are saying that you are engaged with them. It is a sign of openness and trust. Eye contact is a sign of respect for the other person and their perspective. It is also a sign of listening and attentiveness.

The issue is that there is a right turn lane that goes to the exit ramp, but it is blocked by a dumpster. Drivers are forced to take the main lane to get to the exit ramp and then turn right. This causes a backup of cars for 2 miles. The problem is that there is no way to solve this problem with the existing infrastructure. It is possible to make an entrance ramp to the left, but it is not possible to make an", "\n\nHuman: Why was Benton Mackenzie not allowed to talk about his medical condition during his trial?\n\nTL;DR Benton Mackenzie is a terminal cancer patient in Iowa who was arrested for growing cannabis for the purpose of making CBD oil to treat his tumors.\n\nWhy couldn't he explain why he was growing the plants?\n\nDoes this not violate the sixth amendment to the US Constitution?\n\nAssistant: The U.S. Constitution does not include a right to medical care.  This was not an issue in the case and was not relevant to the case.  The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on whether a person has the right to use marijuana to relieve his or her medical symptoms.", "\n\nHuman: Why can't humans consciously control certain bodily responses and functions?\n\nFor example, (if I understand correctly) if pain is a warning that something is wrong, why can't we 'tell' our brain to stop sending those signals once we realize what it is?\n\nAssistant: When the brain is in a stressful situation, the hypothalamus releases a hormone called CRH, which then stimulates the pituitary gland to release ACTH, which then causes the adrenal glands to release cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, which then causes the fight or flight response. This is also why we get 'butterflies in our stomach' when we are nervous. In this case, we cannot stop the release of these hormones once they are released, because the", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The ultraviolet rays from the sun interact with the skin's melanin and cutaneus oxygenase to produce vitamin D. Mammals have evolved to become more efficient at utilizing sunlight as a source of energy by evolving melanin that can better absorb UV light. The UV light is then converted into vitamin D by the skin and then absorbed by the liver. Vitamin D is then converted into an active form that can be used by the body. Vitamin D is also able to help the body utilize calcium and phosphate from the", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The led flickers because it is not able to keep the constant light \nat the same intensity for a long period of time.

How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: Most movies will have a 50/50 split between theater and home video. So 8m would be 4m for the theaters and 4m for home video. Also, the cast and crew get paid a percentage of the 8m. So the cast would get 1.6m. The director would get 1.1m and so on. The rest of the money will go towards marketing, advertising, etc. The 173m does not include any of the marketing costs. If you add those in, the movie probably lost money.", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: The cancer rate for livestock is extremely low, and is less than 1%. This is because the majority of the cancer cells die off after they are formed, and the rest are killed off by the immune system. However, if you consume a tumor, you would be consuming the cancer cells, which can have detrimental effects.  For example, the cells in your body can be weakened by the cancer cells, which can cause you to have a weaker immune system.   This would make you more susceptible to other diseases, and your immune system would not be able to", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops. If I was to cut it in half, how would it know to start growing again?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure how it knows to start growing again. I would guess that if it were to cut off the hair, it would regrow. In nature, some plants and animals have the ability to regrow lost body parts. I would guess that the hair would do the same. \n\nThe reason why your armpit hair grows to a certain length and then stops is because it is a survival mechanism. Armpit hair can trap odors and bacteria. If it was to grow too long, it would collect more bacteria and odor and then you would have a smelly armp", "\n\nHuman: How do wireless phone chargers work\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Wireless phone chargers use a wireless charging method that is based on the electromagnetic induction. To charge the device, a charging pad has to be placed on the tabletop. The charging pad has coils to generate an alternating current. The charging pad detects the presence of the phone and turns on the charging process. The phone has coils that receive the induced current and charge the phone.

How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The RFRA was passed in Indiana in 2015 to protect individuals from being punished by the state government for their religious beliefs. The law allows individuals to refuse to do something that conflicts with their religious beliefs, such as a baker who refuses to make a cake for a same-sex wedding, or a pharmacist who refuses to give a woman birth control. The law also protects religious institutions from the state government.  The law was passed in response to a 2015 Supreme Court decision that limited the government's ability to enforce a law if it", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry is a theory of physics in which every particle in the Standard Model of particle physics is accompanied by a superpartner. It is a theoretical framework that describes the universe and is a possible extension of the standard model of particle physics.\n\nSupersymmetry was first proposed by a Russian mathematician named Leonid V. Pruglov in 1970 and later by a theorist named Abdus Salam in 1971. The theory was originally called the Grand Unified Theory (GUT). The theory was later called supersymmetry because it has", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: The skin on the palms of our hands is thicker and contains less of the oil glands that produce the oily skin barrier that is disrupted by poison ivy/ oak, etc.\n\nTherefore, the palms of our hands are less likely to be affected by the skin disrupting oils in poison ivy/ oak, etc. \n\nThe skin on our palms is also tougher, which protects our hands from the irritation of poison ivy/ oak, etc.\n\nHowever, while poison ivy/ oak, etc. is less", "\n\nHuman: What is actually happening when your heart \"aches\"?\n\nAssistant: Your heart is beating rapidly, you have a hard time taking a deep breath, you feel like you are going to throw up, and you have a pounding headache.  This is called a \"heart ache\" but is actually a symptom of a heart attack.  You may also feel a cold sweat, nausea, and a sinking feeling in your chest.

There are also many people who believe that there are many kinds of ghosts. The term \"Ghost\" is also used to refer to something that is considered to be a spirit or", "\n\nHuman: Why are peanuts so much more affordable than other nuts?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Peanuts are cheaper because they are less nutritious than other nuts. In general, the healthier a nut is, the more expensive it is. The most expensive nuts are macadamia nuts, which have the most calories and fat per ounce. Walnuts and pecans have a medium amount of calories and fat, while peanuts have the least amount of both. Almonds are also less expensive than other nuts because they are the most abundant nuts in the world, which means they are cheaper to produce than other nuts. \n\nPean", "\n\nHuman: How do compression shorts and compression tights help athletes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Compression shorts and tights are designed to be worn underneath your regular workout or sportswear to help improve circulation and minimize muscle soreness.  The compression helps to increase the blood flow through your legs to the heart and back, which is essential for proper performance.  It also helps to reduce muscle soreness after exercise because it helps to increase the amount of blood flowing to the muscles to help flush out lactic acid and other toxins.  Compression shorts and tights also help to minimize the risk of injury by supporting the muscles and ligaments and reducing", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens when you pull your back? I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The muscles in the back will contract to cause the pain. The muscles are designed to help the spine move. When you are resting, the muscles are relaxed. When you move, the muscles contract. The muscles are designed to have a natural range of motion, so when you go outside of that, the muscles get strained. This is why you get pain. \n\nThe spine has 33 vertebral bodies that are separated by discs. The vertebral bodies are the bony structures, and the discs are the cartilage in between the vertebr", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: The supply and demand for a currency, in the long run, depends on how much the economy of the country is growing.\n- If there is a demand for the currency, it will go up.\n- If there is a supply of the currency, it will go up.\n- If there is a demand for the currency, but not enough supply, the value will go up.\n- If there is a supply of the currency, but not enough demand, the value will go down.\n- If there is a supply of the currency, and not enough demand, and not enough supply, the value will go down.", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Most hippies were part of the Baby Boomer generation. At the time, the U.S. economy was booming. The U.S. had just won the Cold War, and had a strong economy. The U.S. also did not have a draft at the time. The baby boomers were the first generation in U.S. history to be able to afford to travel and enjoy a lifestyle without having to worry about money. Most of the hippies were young adults who were fresh out of college and were looking for work. They could afford to travel and enjoy a lifestyle", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: Sleep is a biological necessity for us, and has been for as long as we have existed. In fact, a single night of sleep is not enough, we need at least 8 hours of sleep everyday, and for some, even more. This means that we need to sleep at least 128 hours every week. \n\nOur body has evolved to sleep based on the earth's rotation. The Earth rotates around its axis, and takes 24 hours to complete a single rotation. \nAs the Earth turns, the sun rises and sets, and we get a day.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: When you say better, you mean faster. This is because computers are made of transistors, and the number of transistors that can be packed into a computer is limited by the laws of physics. For example, the laws of physics dictate that if you want to make a smaller computer, you need to make it faster.\n\nSo, the answer to the first question is that the manufacturers of computers and flash drives, are able to make computers and flash drives faster. However, the manufacturers of computers and flash drives, cannot make a computer or flash drive smaller if the laws of physics are not", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 10*10^99 is not a number that can be shown by the calculator because it is not a binary integer.  The maximum integer that can be represented by the calculator is 99*2^10=10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: You need to chew your food well enough that your stomach acids can break down your food into nutrients and not leave you with stinky gas. If you don't chew your food enough, your stomach acid will be unable to break down your food and you'll end up with stinky gas. If you don't chew your food enough, you won't be able to digest it and your body will not absorb the nutrients. If you don't chew your food well enough, your stomach acids will be unable to break down", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: It's called the gustatory nerve. The gustatory nerve has branches that are innervated in the tongue and oral cavity. It's stimulated by substances that are injected or administered to the mouth. When this happens, the patient experiences a tingling or a burning sensation. This is a normal reaction and is not harmful. It's the same reason you can feel the IV line if you press on it. \n\nIt's also why when you have a needle stick, you'll experience a slight numbing sensation. The same", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a property of a system that is influenced by the history of the system.  For example, the length of a spring is influenced by the length of the spring in the past.  The more the spring has been compressed in the past, the more it will take to compress the spring in the future.  The opposite is true for a spring that has been stretched in the past.  The more the spring has been stretched in the past, the more it will take to compress the spring in the future.  In some cases, the length of the spring can never be exactly the same in the", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

Some are very religious, some are very atheist.  Some are very patriotic, some are very anti-authoritarian.  Some are very traditional, some are very modern.  Some are very open to new ideas, some are", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The eye has a specialised muscle called the 'M\u00fcller's muscle' which is responsible for keeping the eye lubricated by producing a thin watery substance called the 'lymph'. The lymph is produced in the 'conjunctiva' (which is the membrane that covers the front of the eye and the inside of the eyelid), and is released into the eye through the 'plica semilunaris' (a small fold of tissue in the conjunctiva). The lymph is then absorbed by the 'cornea' (the transparent front", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The difference between the performance of a $115 and $670 CPU is more than $565!  So, clearly, there is no rip-off here.  There are many things to consider when buying a CPU, including:  - Clock speed\n\n - Core count\n\n - Integrated graphics (AMD)\n\n - Manufacturer reputation\n\n - Price\n\n - Cooling\n\n - Overclocking ability\n\n - AMD vs. Intel\n\n - Processor socket type\n\n - Power consumption\n\n - 64-bit or 3", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think it has to do with our body being sleep deprived, and our brain not being able to shut off. Our body wants to shut down and go to sleep, but our brain doesn't want to, so our body starts to get really tired. The body tries to tell our brain it's sleepy by making our eyes twitch, to give us a little nudge to go to sleep.  However, the brain is stubborn and won't shut down, so our body just keeps on trying to tell us to go to sleep. This is why you may have noticed that you've gone", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: If you look at the 2019-2020 CDC data, the median life expectancy of people with advanced cancer is 3.4 months. That's with treatment. If you don't have treatment, it's only 2.7 months.\n\nI'm not sure how much of that is due to symptoms and how much is due to the cancer.\n\nBut I can tell you from personal experience that once I had Stage 4 cancer, I was always having symptoms and never had a day where I felt 100%. In fact, my doctor", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because the music is recorded with a microphone and then compressed.\n\nThe compression removes the natural variations in the recording. The result is music that is quite unnatural sounding.\n\nA human voice is a natural, varying sound.  It is not compressed, and it does not sound like a canned recording.  A human voice can sound like a canned recording if it is recorded with a microphone, but even then it is not as canned as a canned music recording.\n\nThe sound of a canned music recording is a result of the compression.  The compression reduces the variations in", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There is a high probability that some of the countries in the Middle East will experience genocide, mass murder, or mass displacement. It is important to note that these events may not be caused by Western intervention, but by the continued conflict between the Middle East countries. \n\nThere is a high probability that the current conflicts in the Middle East will cause the United States to be forced to take action, which will cause more violence and suffering. \n\nIt is also possible that the United States will be forced to take a hands-off approach in the region, which would cause the region to be plagued by", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: The primary reason sugar is bad is because it is a source of empty calories.  It is a source of empty calories because it provides no nutritional value.  The only benefit of sugar is that it has a low cost and a high taste.\n\nThe body does not require any sugar to perform basic functions.  This means that you can consume sugar and not feel any different.  The problem is that sugar can lead to excessive consumption of calories.  You do not need calories in order to survive.  Calories are required in order to perform certain tasks.  Exercising and", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week. However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: I'm not 100% sure. But I think it's because Americans watch TV so much more than we do. \n\nThere are so many more options for American viewers. \n\n- \n\nThe main thing is there are more American channels and there are more late-night shows. So, the people who watch it have more options. \n\n- \n\nAlso, Americans are more interested in celebrities than the British. \n\n- \n\nSo, when they watch talk shows, they want to see who they can watch on other shows.", "\n\nHuman: Origin of \"In Mother Russia...\" jokes\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: Colloidal silver?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Silver is an element. It has the symbol Ag and the atomic number 47. It is a metal.\n\nIt is often found in nature as an alloy with other metals, such as silversteel, which contains 54% silver.\n\nSilver is a precious metal and has been used as a currency.  It is not the most common currency in the world.\n\nIt is used in jewelry, as well as in industrial applications.  It is also used in electronics.  Silver can be mined and extracted from its ore.  Silver is also found in", "\n\nHuman: Why do you \"drive\" a car, but \"pilot\" a boat, plane, etc.?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Boats and planes are driven by engines, cars are powered by an engine that is controlled by the driver.\n\nThe reason \"pilot\" is used is because the \"pilot\" is in charge of the direction, speed and destination of the vessel.  The \"driver\" is in charge of the speed and destination of the vehicle.  The difference between the two words is that \"pilot\" is used for the person who is in charge of the vessel's direction, and \"driver\" is used for the person who is in charge of the vehicle's speed and destination.  \"", "\n\nHuman: Why do popular reddit posts tend to cap out around 4k up votes when there is such a big amount of people using reddit?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Reddit uses a system of Karma points that are used to upvote and downvote posts. Each time a user upvotes a post, they lose 1 point and each time a user downvotes a post, they gain 1 point. When a post reaches a certain amount of upvotes, it will be considered 'popular' and will stop being able to gain more upvotes. This is to prevent spam from gaining too much popularity and making it difficult for other interesting posts to be seen. \n\nReddit also uses a system of 'golden tickets' where users", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If a piece of diamond tried to break through another piece of diamond, it would be like a piece of paper trying to break through a piece of steel. The diamond would not be able to penetrate the other diamond. If the diamond tried to break through glass, the diamond would be able to break through the glass, but it would be very difficult because the glass is much harder than the diamond. If the diamond tried to break through ceramic, the diamond would be able to break through the ceramic but it would be very difficult because the ceramic is much harder than", "\n\nHuman: Why does the Xbox One need a brick in between the outlet plug and the console where as the PS4 doesn't?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The PS4 does not have a brick, but it does have a larger power supply than the Xbox One, requiring a larger outlet. However, the Xbox One has an AC adapter that is similar in size to a brick, and requires a brick to provide additional power. The Xbox One's brick provides additional power to the AC adapter, which provides the console with sufficient power. The PS4's larger power supply and AC adapter is sufficient for the PS4 without needing a brick. The Xbox One requires the brick because the PS4's larger power supply and AC adapter is sufficient for the PS4", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: There are two kinds of pigment in the Chlorophyll molecule, one is green and one is black. The green pigment, chlorophyll a, absorbs light and the energy from the light is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. The black pigment, chlorophyll b, does not absorb light, but instead reflects light. When the light is reflected it is re-emitted as infrared radiation. In this way, the green pigment does not absorb all the light energy and the excess is reflected", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The anandamide is not metabolized by the body in the same way that THC is, so it will not produce a positive result on a urine test for THC. However, it may cause a positive result on a urine test for THC metabolites, such as THC-COOH, because it is a metabolite itself. \n\nFor this reason, it is possible for a person to experience the runner's high without consuming THC or any other cannabinoid. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that there are some other drugs", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The liquid's viscosity is determined by the molecules' \nintermolecular forces. When the forces become stronger than the forces \nof gravity, then the liquid becomes solid.  The viscosity of a liquid is \ndependent upon the type of molecules that make up the liquid and the \ntemperature of the liquid. The higher the temperature, the lower the \nviscosity.  The colder the liquid, the higher the viscosity. When the \ntemperature of the liquid is zero, then the viscosity is infinite. \nHowever, when the", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: He owned 25% of the stocks in Skyfleet Airlines. After the attempted bombing, the stocks dropped in value, which caused a 2.5% drop in the value of Le Chiffre's 25% shareholding in Skyfleet Airlines.  Therefore, he would have lost 1% of his shareholding, which would have been approximately \u00a32.5 million.\n\nTo recap, if the stocks had not dropped, then Le Chiffre would have earned \u00a32.5 million. However, due to the drop in stocks,", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: The mouse is an input device. It transmits electrical signals to the monitor, which in turn displays it as a cursor. The monitor also sends electrical signals back to the mouse. This is why the cursor moves when you move the mouse. The mouse is also connected to the keyboard, which is another input device. When you move the mouse, you're also moving the keyboard. The keyboard is also connected to the computer, which is a third input device. When you press a key on the keyboard, you're also pressing the key on the computer. The computer also sends electrical signals to the mouse, and the", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are two ways that the mirror scene can be shot: the first is with a double, and the second is with a mirror. The double is a person who looks like the actor, and the mirror is a mirror that is the same shape and size as the actor. When shooting a scene with the double, the director will instruct the actor to put his or her head in the double's hands. The double will then put the actor's head in the mirror. When shooting a scene with a mirror, the director will instruct the actor to put his or her head in the mirror. The mirror will then be placed on a", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that there are no health benefits to the procedure for boys. However, the AAP does recommend that the procedure be performed in the first year of life to prevent infections, and to reduce the risk of urinary tract infection, urinary tract infection, and penile cancer.  The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the procedure has benefits for both sexes, including decreasing the risk of HIV/AIDS, as well as urinary tract infection, and urinary tract infection, and penile cancer.  The", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Go is a zero-sum game, and because it is a zero-sum game, it is a finite game. Chess is a non-zero sum game, and because it is a non-zero sum game, it is a non-finite game. In a finite game, every state has a finite number of moves available, while in a non-finite game, every state has an infinite number of moves available.\n\nIn Chess, the number of states is finite because each piece has a finite number of moves available, and in Go, the number of states is infinite because each player has an infinite number of moves", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: It's because they use the right ingredients and they cook it the right way.  If you want to make Chinese food, you have to learn about the ingredients and how to use them properly.  You also have to know how to cook the different types of dishes.  It's not as simple as just throwing some ingredients in a pot and hoping for the best.  It's more complicated than that.  Most people don't have the time or the patience to learn the right way to cook Chinese food, so they order takeout instead.  If you want to", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is because we have to make our pupils smaller in order to capture more light from a distant object. We do this by contracting the sphincter muscle around the pupil. This process is called 'mydriasis'.  The reverse process of relaxing the sphincter muscle is 'mydriasis'.  The process of increasing the size of the pupil is called 'mydriasis'.  The reverse process of decreasing the size of the pupil is called 'mydriasis'.  When we squint we are trying to decrease the size of the pupil by", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water is pumped into a tank, then it's bubbled with carbon dioxide to give it a carbonated fizz. This process is called carbonation. The water is then filtered to remove the impurities. The water is then bottled and sold.  The water will still be in the fizzing stage for a few days, so it will have a slightly higher carbonation than tap water.  When the bubbles disappear, it's no longer carbonated.  This is called saturation. This happens because the carbon dioxide molecules are trapped in the water", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a good question! The British and American spelling systems are different. This is because of the way that the countries developed and colonized. \n\nIn the UK, people began to write English in the 15th and 16th centuries. \nIn the USA, English spelling was first recorded in the 17th century. \nBoth countries developed their own spelling systems and they are still used today. \n\nThe American spelling system is also known as the 'phonetic' system. It is based on the way that words are pronounced. \nThe British", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the shower, the temperature of the water changes because the water is heated up by the heating element and the water from the faucet is cold. When you turn the shower on, the water from the faucet is heated up and the temperature of the water increases. As you turn the knob, the heating element is turned on and off which causes the water to heat up and cool down in a short amount of time. The more the knob is turned, the colder the water becomes because the heating element is turned off. When you are done with the shower, you can", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014. What has happened during the last 12 months? Is the situation better or worse?\n\nAssistant: ISIS has lost control of some of the territory it held in Iraq and Syria in 2014. In June 2015, they have lost control of Fallujah and Ramadi, and their territory in Iraq is reduced to a small area in the east. They have lost the city of Tikrit in Iraq, and their territory in Syria is reduced to a small area around the city of Aleppo. However, their territory is still larger than it was in 2014. ISIS is still a serious threat and they are still a major military force. The situation", "\n\nHuman: How does having a record label help bands, and how would an indie label differ from a major label?\n\nI've searched this many times but have yet to get a clear answer. anyone have a simple explanation that could be a little more clear?\n\nAssistant: A record label can help a band in many ways.  A label can help in securing a recording contract with a major record company.  Major record companies provide a distribution network for the product, the ability to print physical product in large numbers, and the ability to market the product to radio and retail outlets.  Major record companies have distribution deals with digital music stores, such as Apple Music.  Some indie labels can provide distribution to the digital music stores.  Major record companies have distribution deals with other record companies.  Indie labels can only distribute to other indie labels.  Major record", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A single train car weighs about 100 tons. So a train pulling 200 cars, 200*100 = 20,000 tons, is pulling about 20,000 * 100 = 2,000,000 pounds, which is 2,000 tons. 20,000 tons is a huge amount of weight. A train car is usually made of steel, but in the past, wood was used for the frames of some cars. Wood is much lighter than steel and can", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: One method is to use a known translation. Another is to use a reference work on the language and culture, such as the Oxford Guide to the Ancient World. The use of a known translation, however, is the most common method and the most accurate. The ancient texts must be checked for errors of grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which can be very difficult. \nThe text must be checked against the original language and culture of the author to be certain of the meaning. The translator must be familiar with the culture, and the use of the words of the culture in the text. The translator must also", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: This is a question that has been asked for many years by many a dog-lover. The answer is that it's not so much the moisture itself that amplifies the smell but the presence of water in the air. The reason for this is that water molecules can hold a lot of oxygen. \n\nAs the water evaporates from a surface, it takes some of the oxygen with it, leaving behind a surface that is dry but not necessarily odorless. In fact, it often contains more oxygen than it did before, leading to a more intense smell.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The LHC is trying to answer fundamental questions about the nature of our universe.  These questions include:  what is dark matter, what is dark energy, and what is the Higgs boson.  The LHC is also trying to answer the question of whether the strong and electroweak forces are unified.  The LHC is also trying to answer the question of whether the laws of physics are the same across all of space and time.  These are fundamental questions about the nature of our universe.  Answering these questions may help us answer other questions about the nature of our universe.  If we can determine what", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The right and the left are terms that we use to distinguish between different political parties in the United States and other democracies. In the United States, we use them to distinguish between Republicans and Democrats, for example. We use the terms to distinguish between different parties that have different political ideologies, and we use the terms to distinguish between parties that have different political priorities.\n\nThe terms are used to distinguish between different political parties, but they're not used to distinguish between different political ideologies. This is because a political ideology is a set of values, and a political party is a group of people", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: It's not that simple. It depends on whether you're going faster or slower than light. If you're going faster than light, the time that passes on your clock is less than the time that passes on an earth clock. If you're going slower than light, the time that passes on your clock is more than the time that passes on an earth clock. If you're going faster than light, the time that passes on your clock is less than the time that passes on an earth clock. If you're going slower than light, the time that passes on your clock is more than the time that passes", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We decided the meter to be it\u2019s specific length based on the distance from the North Pole to the equator. We kept that length consistent over the years by having it be the distance from the North Pole to the equator. \nThe meter was first defined in 1793, when the French National Convention decreed that the meter would be defined as the length of a line along the Earth's surface from the North Pole to the Equator and back to the North Pole. \nThe meter was defined in terms of a specific number of wavelengths in a particular spectral line,", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason is because when you are little, your eye is sensitive to the presence of soap. When you get soap in your eye, it feels excruciatingly painful because you can feel the soap getting into the inside of your eye. When you are an adult, the pain is less because you are no longer sensitive to the presence of soap. So, your body's reaction to the soap is lessened by the fact that you are no longer sensitive to the presence of soap. In addition, soap is less likely to get into the inner part of your eye when you are an adult because the size of your eye is", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason is because we have not detected it directly. We have seen it indirectly through its gravitational pull. The reason we have not detected it directly is because its orbit is too large. We have a really good idea where it is, but we have not been able to detect it directly. Scientists believe it is there because of a mathematical model they developed from the orbits of other planets in our solar system. \nThe reason we have not detected it directly is because its orbit is too large. We have a really good idea where it is, but we have not been able to detect it directly. Scientists believe", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A newly-bedded black widow is not a cannibal, but a parasitoid. They will eat the male to eliminate competition for food. Parasitoid species do not doom a species; they are merely a natural part of the ecosystem. The species that is doomed is the male, who is not needed to perpetuate the species. The male has a different reproductive strategy than the female. A male is a sperm donor, not a parent. The female will produce her own eggs and then eat the male. The sperm is not needed and the male is thus", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Lemons and limes are the most acidic of the citrus fruits. They are sour and bitter in taste and do not encourage animals to eat them and carry their seeds. They are not fruits, but rather berries.  They have seeds that are not large enough to be dispersed by animals. They need to be planted in the ground for fruit to grow. Lemons and limes are not as common in the wild as other citrus fruits. They are cultivated and do not grow naturally.  They are not as common in the wild as other citrus fruits. They", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: The average movie budget is $100 million. It is unclear how much the studios pay for product placement, as many companies do not want to release this information.\n\nA product placement is the inclusion of a brand or product in a film, television program, or video game.\n\nThe practice of product placement is referred to as \"product integration\" in the United States, \"product placement\" in Europe, and \"product placement\" in the UK.\n\nIn the United States, product integration is a legal practice. In Europe, product placement is legal only in the UK, Den", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: Word converts the link into a graphic, which is slow to render. This is akin to a screen saver that freezes your screen. The browser does not have to convert the link to a graphic, which is why it is faster to click on it in the browser.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: Most horses are not trained or accustomed to being led around on a leash.  Most horses are kept on a large farm or ranch where they are accustomed to running around free.  If a horse is injured, it is often more humane to put it down rather than trying to lead it around on a leash.  Also, horses can be very dangerous when they get agitated, so if a horse is sick, it is often better for the horse, the owner, and the vet to put it down.  There is also a chance that the horse will hurt other horses in the herd", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The UN has been trying to do that for a long time, but it's not a simple matter to do.  The Republic of Cyprus, the Greek-speaking part of the island, has a constitution that is based on the Greek Constitution of 1975, and the Turkish-speaking part of the island, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, has a constitution that is based on the Turkish Constitution of 1982.  Both of these constitutions, and the countries that they represent, are internationally recognized, and both have a UN membership.  In 20", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: The answer is simple. It is because children are more fragile than adults and are more likely to be preserved. Children are also less likely to be killed in conflict, so they will be preserved. This is why we have a lot of fossilized remains of children, as they are preserved much better than adults. \n\nIn addition, children are also more likely to be preserved in a burial context, as they are less likely to have the ability to fight back in the event of conflict. This is why we have a lot of skeletal remains in burial contexts from children.\n\nThe Ice", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Males of a species usually have physical differences from the females due to differences in sexual reproduction. In sexual reproduction, sperm must fuse with an egg to produce offspring. The sperm must be able to penetrate the egg in order for fertilization to occur.  Males of a species are usually smaller in size than females due to the sperm they produce. The sperm has to be very small in order to fit into the female's egg.  In species where males have two testes, the two testes must be kept at a consistent temperature. Males of a species must also", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: There is a theoretical limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet.  The amount of information that can be sent is the bandwidth of the cable.  The bandwidth of the cable is the speed at which information can be sent.  The cable internet has a theoretical limit of 100 megabits per second, but is limited to 20 megabits per second by the company that provides the internet.  Bandwidth is the amount of information that can be sent, and is expressed in megabits per second.  Bandwidth is measured in the number of bits per second", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: People would use a bell to wake up.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: The coin flips are not dependent on each other. The next flip is independent of the previous flips. \n\nIn 100 coin flips, 50% of them will be heads, and 50% of them will be tails. \n\nIn 1000 coin flips, 500 of them will be heads, and 500 of them will be tails. \n\nTherefore, if you have seen 10 heads in a row, it is actually more likely to be tails than heads because the probability", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In a 1985 article by Seth Freid, Nintendo's Gunpei Yokoi, who had been instrumental in the development of the NES, claimed that the NES light gun was \"the most complicated and difficult thing we've ever designed\".

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?

Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: \\em{\\strong{One another}} is a grammatically correct way of saying \"one and another\".

They are a business after all.  They are the ones who are profiting from the Qatar World Cup.  They are not going to want to jeopardise the profits of the World Cup.  They also don't want to lose the respect of the 192 countries that are members of FIFA.  If they were to speak out on the human rights violations of Qatar, then they would be in a very difficult position.

I'm having trouble finding information on sure deposit, it seems like I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nAssistant: 1. Sure Deposit is a fee that is charged by the bank to process the credit card for payment.  This is an unrelated fee and not a deposit.  The bank will also tell you that it is a fee for the credit card company.  There are a few reasons why banks charge this fee.

What's up with that? Are the rules different for that part of the body?\n\nEDIT: What the hell? Ads about hair products started showing on reddit. Ads do get smarter. \n\nAssistant: The testosterone levels are higher in men than in women, but the hair follicles are sensitive to the level of testosterone. So the testosterone level affects the hair growth. In general, the testosterone level goes down, which leads to hair loss. A large number of men will have some hair loss by the time they are 30 years old. However, some will lose hair from the front of the head while the hair on the back of the head remains. \n\nFor some people, the front of the head hair grows back while the back of the head remains bald.

In many cultures, men are more open to the idea of casual sex, and in some, it's even the norm to have casual sex. In the US, it's not. Some people think that this is because of the biological differences between men and women, but this is not the case. \n\nThe reason why men are more likely to be open to the idea of casual sex is because they are taught that they should be open to the idea of casual sex.

Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In hibernation, the animal's body temperature drops to as low as 32 degrees Fahrenheit. While this is the temperature at which the animal will fall asleep, it's also the temperature at which the animal will not die. This is a critical component to understanding how hibernation works. The animal will be in a state of deep sleep, but their body is still running on its own metabolism. This is why they can survive months without eating.\n\nThe animal's body temperature is still regulated, and the animal will wake up when it reaches the body temperature", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: - Language is a complex system, and is not something that is easily learned.  However, the more you practice and study, the better you get.  The learning curve is steep, but there is a big difference between understanding a language and speaking it.  This is because the skills required to speak a language are very different from the skills needed to understand a language.

The human body contains around 60% water, so in terms of the ratio of body mass to volume of water, a human needs 5000 litres to drown. 8000 litres is around the volume of a large bathtub. However, if a person is swimming, the surface tension of the water around the human body reduces the effect of the water weight, and the body mass to volume ratio is around 8. In this case, the volume of water required to d", "\n\nHuman: what is the reason for those few extra blank white pages in the back of a book?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The blank pages in the back of a book are called 'flies'.

This is the case because the write in candidates are not registered with the Federal Election Committee (FEC) and therefore, are not on the ballot. In order to win a national election, the write in candidate must win the majority of the state votes, which requires a majority of 270 votes. To do this, the write in candidate must have a large number of votes in the states where the candidate is most popular. If the write in candidate wins the", "\n\nHuman: How did people used to train pigeons to carry mail at the long distance, back in the day?\n\nI was always curious, did they have different pigeon for each address and if not, how pigeon knows whom to send? \n\nAssistant: One of the methods for training pigeons was to use a specialized harness and a ring on the bird's leg with a message attached to it. The pigeon would then be released and return to the trainer. Another way was to teach the pigeon to return to the trainer from a distance using a piece of cloth or a rope. The cloth or rope would be tied to a special ring on the pigeon's leg and then released. The pigeon would then return to the trainer. To teach the pigeon to return from a distance, a small piece of", "\n\nHuman: Why are people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war shamed instead of admired? Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The US military draft was a system of conscription instituted in 1940 in the US to allow men to serve in the military. In the 1960s, young men were drafted to serve in the Vietnam War, a conflict that was unpopular with many Americans. \nWhile many young men were drafted and sent to Vietnam, some young men were able to avoid this fate by obtaining a student deferment, which allowed them to go to college. By 1969, there was a backlash against the Vietnam War, and the draft. \nMany", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: I don't think we have the tools to do it now, but it is possible that we could make the attempt in the future.  I don't think it is possible to use a human as a surrogate mother, because we don't know how to get a human to successfully gestate a Neanderthal fetus.  I also think that the Neanderthal genome is too different from the human genome to use viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  I think the only way to do this would be to use a Neanderthal egg or sperm.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender is a person who identifies as a member of the opposite sex from their biological sex. A transsexual is a person who feels that they were born in the wrong body and want to change their gender to the opposite sex. \n\nTranssexuals will want to undergo a series of surgical and hormonal treatments to change their gender.\n\nA transgender will not want to undergo these procedures. \n\nTransgender people are often treated as a gender they do not identify with, however, it is not necessary to undergo any surgical or hormonal treatments to", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: 1. The brain produces a neurotransmitter called Dopamine, which is responsible for most of the pleasurable sensations we feel. Cannabis acts as a Dopamine agonist, meaning that it activates Dopamine receptors, which causes the brain to produce more Dopamine. This is why you feel so good when you smoke weed.\n2. Cannabis also acts as a serotonin agonist, meaning that it activates Serotonin receptors. Serotonin is responsible for the sensation", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons why there are so many package stores. There are a number of factors that contribute to the number of package stores in New England, including the ability to have a store with a liquor license at a significantly lower cost compared to other types of retail stores, the ability to sell high-margin products like cigarettes, and the ability to open a store with relatively low barriers.\n\nThe cost of the liquor license is significantly lower than other retail licenses.

Meaning, you had to live in the same block/city to connect to it? \n\n\nAssistant: The BBS was a popular way of connecting to other users across the globe before the internet. These BBSs ran on a single computer, and could support several users at the same time. A BBS would have a dial-in phone number which you could call from your home. Once connected, you would be presented with a login prompt. After you logged in, you would be given a shell, or a window into the operating system. You could then run programs or interact with other users. The BBS software was usually designed by the user who had the BBS. If you were an experienced programmer, you could", "\n\nHuman: What is Russell's paradox? and please explain like i am 5, i don't know anything.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Russell's paradox is a paradox which arises from the naive set theory of the 19th century, \nwhich states that the set of all sets which are not members of themselves is a member of itself. \nThis leads to a contradiction, and it is one of the paradoxes that led to the creation of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, which was the first set theory to eliminate paradoxes like Russell's paradox. \nThe paradox is named after Bertrand Russell, who in 1901 \nwrote", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: Here are some of the reasons I could find:\n\n- The religion of Iran is Twelver Shi'a Islam. The current Supreme Leader is a Twelver Shi'a, which may be relevant.\n\n- Iranian society is notably more liberal than other Middle Eastern countries.\n\n- There are many transsexuals in Iran, and they are accepted as part of society.\n\n- Transgender individuals are treated with respect in Iran.\n\n- Iranians are generally accepting of people who are different from the norm.\n\n- In 2018, the government of", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: It's a combination of factors. There are certain ingredients that are known to cause depression, such as opioids and anticholinergic antidepressants. There are others that are known to cause depression as a result of taking them regularly, such as benzodiazepines. And then there are some which can cause depression as a result of being prescribed to people who are already depressed. \n\nThere are many medications that have depression as a side effect. Some of these medications are antidepressants, such as selective serotonin re", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear? Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: - Water is clear when it is pure, free from contaminants and sediments. The sky gives the water its color, and it reflects the color of the sky.\nThe color of the water depends on the color of the sky and the type of water. Rivers are usually brownish, as they contain a lot of sediments and organic matter, while lakes are usually green, due to the presence of algae.\nThe water's color is also affected by its depth, temperature, and the amount of sunlight it receives. \nWater can also have a blue color if it is highly", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the IR transmitter on the zapper uses the PAL signal which is not compatible with NTSC or SECAM signals.  The NES is designed for a specific type of signal, which is why it doesn't work with newer TVs.  The same is true for the Gameboy, which uses the NTSC signal.  The Gameboy and the NES both use NTSC because it is the standard in the US.  The SECAM and PAL standards were developed for Europe and Japan.  These two standards are not compatible with NTSC.  This is why the z", "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between 32 and 64bit computer systems, and why aren't there, say 128bit systems.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The physical number of bits is a simple measure of how much memory and how fast the computer can process information.\n\nFor example, if a computer has 4GB of memory, it can store 4 bytes of information. The more bits, the more memory a computer can store, and the more information it can process at one time.\n\nIf a computer has a 64-bit processor, it can process 64-bits of information at one time.\n\nThe 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows, Mac OS, and Linux are based on the number of bits in", "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Control, Alt, Delete (CAD) keyboard shortcut is a set of keys on keyboards \nof IBM PC compatible computers.

It will also make it easier to confiscate guns from people who have committed crimes or who are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. The laws will also make it easier to prevent mass shootings by requiring background checks and will require the guns that are bought to be stored safely and secured. Gun laws will also make it harder to commit crimes with guns by making it harder to get guns and by making it easier to identify criminals who have guns.]", "\n\nHuman: Why do banks offer interest? What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Banks offer interest in order to encourage their customers to deposit money with them instead of elsewhere. The interest is a reward for the money that is loaned to the bank. Banks use the interest to make profits, which helps them to grow and keep providing services. The bank then uses the profits to pay interest to the customers that deposited the money with them. This encourages customers to continue to deposit money with the bank, as they will receive interest on their deposits.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Banks offer interest in order to encourage their customers to deposit money with", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Income inequality in the US is the most pronounced since the Great Depression and is likely the worst among developed countries. Income inequality is measured by the Gini index which is a scale of 0 to 1. In 2019, the US Gini index was 0.43, the highest in the OECD. \n\nThe Gini index in the US has risen steadily since the 1970s, peaking in 2017, and has not fallen since. The Gini index rose in the 1970s, 1", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge? If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: There are many reasons for the signs. The first is that the signs are required by the AASHTO (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) standards. This is a national standard that is used by all states. The sign is required for all overpasses that are 16 feet or taller.\n\nThe second reason is that the signs are required by law. It is required that the signs be placed on the overpasses. The signs are usually placed on the side that is facing the oncoming traffic.\n\nThe third reason is that the signs are used to alert drivers to the over", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly. I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: I'm not 100% certain how the shell would kill him instantly, but if I had to take a wild guess, it's because it exploded in his head, and his brain is so delicate that it could have been instantly destroyed. \n\n*The shell is a low-grade explosive, and the high-grade explosive would have a much better chance of killing him instantly.\n\nAlternatively, the shell could have been filled with a chemical that is highly toxic, and the toxicity would have killed him instantly.\n\nAnother possibility is that the shell", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: The reason that the noises get louder during winter is because the air is dryer during the winter.  When the air is dry, the sound waves can travel further.  When the air is moist, the sound waves are absorbed.  The moisture in the air acts as a barrier to the sound waves.  In the winter, the air is dry.  This allows the sound waves to travel further and be heard from a farther distance.  This is why the noises are louder during the winter.  This is also why the noises are louder when it is wind", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: It's believed that people with higher educations are more likely to be liberal because they are more exposed to and have more contact with other people from different backgrounds.  Additionally, there is a trend of people who have higher educations to have more liberal values and political views.  There are a lot of factors that lead to this, but they include things such as more exposure to different cultures and ideas, greater awareness of the world, and a higher standard of living which leads to a greater desire to help others.  People with higher educations also tend to have more liberal views and politics because they are", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Adele's voice is naturally strong, but it is also trained to produce a particular sound. When she sings, she is able to alter her voice to produce a high pitch and a particular tone. Other singers, however, do not have such trained voices and, as a result, do not sound very good when singing. \n\nAdele is a singer, actress, and songwriter. She is also known for being able to sing a wide range of genres, including pop, R&B, and soul. Her voice is naturally strong and is trained to produce a particular sound. When she s", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The air around the clouds is colder than the air at the top of the clouds, and so the clouds are held together by the temperature gradient.  This is called 'cold adiabatic' condensation.  However, the temperature of the air at the top of the clouds is still above the dew point temperature, so this condensation is not the primary cause of the formation of clouds.  The primary cause is the evaporation of water from the surface of the Earth.  The clouds will form when the air is saturated with water vapour, meaning that the dew point temperature", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is an extremely difficult question to answer. This is a very broad topic, and one that is not fully understood. In general, larger animals tend to live longer, but there are many factors that could be involved. Size of the animal is only one factor. Age, environment, diet, health, and many other factors affect the lifespan of any animal. We can't be certain why smaller animals tend to live shorter lives, but this is certainly a question that can be explored further. A study by the University of Manchester in 2019 suggested that smaller animals have shorter lives because they are more sus", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The first people we call mom and dad are our biological parents. The term mom and dad have been used for centuries in different languages. Our modern usage of mom and dad is from the 16th century. They are also used in other languages such as French, German, Dutch, Spanish, and Italian. In these languages, the term mom and dad are used to address someone older than you. However, in some languages, the term mom and dad are also used to address someone younger than you. In English, we use mom and dad to address both our parents and our children. We also", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: 22.3 + 3.45 = 25.75. 3.45 is a single digit number, so 25.75 has 2 significant digits.\n\n* 22.3 is a double-digit number. 3 is a single-digit number. 22.3 + 3.45 = 25.75. 25.75 has 2 significant digits.\n\n* 22.3 + 3.45 = 25.75. 3.45 is a single", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The bile that is stored in the gallbladder is a digestive fluid that is produced in the liver. It helps to break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. When a fatty meal is eaten, the bile and pancreatic enzymes are released into the small intestine to help break down the food. Your liver also produces bile to help the intestines break down fats. The bile is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. The bile is then released into the small intestine", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high pitch ringing noise is called 'snow' and it is because the TV is using an old analog signal to tune the signal. The signal is too weak to carry all the information, so it is being overlaid with white noise. This is called modulation. The TV is using an AM signal. AM is an older signal. AM stands for amplitude modulation. The AM signal is the same frequency as the TV signal. So the TV signal gets overlaid with white noise and the TV turns it into snow. To turn off the TV you need to turn it off with the power button.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries run out of power when the reactions that are used to produce electricity are unable to keep up with the amount of power being used by the device. When the reaction is no longer able to produce enough electricity, the batteries will stop producing electricity and the device will stop working. There are many different types of batteries, including alkaline, lithium, and rechargeable batteries. They all work in slightly different ways, but the same principle applies: they all produce electricity through a chemical reaction. The battery is the source of energy for the device, and the device uses that energy", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: I think that there are two reasons why kids like to spin in circles. One is that it is fun. The other is that it is a way to get your wits back. You spin around for a second and then you feel like you have a new perspective on things.  It's a way to reset your brain.  Kids love to spin in circles because it's fun and they get a chance to reset their minds.  It's the same reason why people go on roller coasters and spinning rides at amusement parks.  These types of activities are enjoyable and also", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a number of different versions of the Big Bang Theory. The version we are referring to here is the 14-year-old version of the theory. In this version of the theory, the Universe began with a Big Bang, which created the initial conditions of the Universe. This Big Bang was the beginning of time and space and was the beginning of the universe. The Big Bang Theory says that the universe began 14 billion years ago. There is still some debate on what the theory means but that is the most accepted version of the theory. The Big Bang Theory is a widely accepted theory for the origin of", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 1. The beat is the basic unit of music. It is a strong, regular pulse (usually a heartbeat) that keeps time. The beat can be expressed as a number (e.g., 4/4 or 12/8) or by a symbol (e.g., C or \n\n* \n\nA). The number of beats in a bar is called the meter. The meter is usually a multiple of the beat (e.g., 4/4, 3/4, 6/8, 7/8, 5/8,", "\n\nHuman: The Jerry Springer Show\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The Jerry Springer Show is an American syndicated tabloid talk show that debuted in 1991, hosted by Jerry Springer. The show was produced by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and is currently distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution. \n\nThe show features audience members who express their opinions, usually as in a panel, but sometimes in other formats, on a controversial topic, such as violence, sex, dating, or relationships. The show has been criticized for its use of sensationalism and its depictions of violence, and was cancelled by NBC in 20", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: I believe it's because of the evolutionary advantage of being able to recognize and relate to other animals.  This ability allowed early humans to form coalitions and cooperate with others in a group to survive.  And, in our modern world, this same ability has allowed us to cooperate and understand each other to form a civil society and a nation.  It's this same ability that helps us understand and empathize with other people who are not like us, or who are different in some way.  Because of this, we're able to recognize the vulnerability of a baby animal and recognize", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet, or PoE, is a standardized system of delivering both electrical power and data via Ethernet cabling. The power can be delivered over the same cable as the data, making it possible to install network devices in hard-to-reach or unpowered locations. \nIn PoE, the data and power are separated by a high-speed transceiver, allowing each to be transmitted over a single cable. \nThe standard defines two modes of operation: low power and full power. Low-power devices only require 44V to operate. \nFull", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason we can see colors is because of a feature called the retina in the eye. The retina is a layer of cells in the back of the eye that converts light into an electrical signal that is sent to the brain. This signal is processed and we see the colors. In other animals, this feature does not exist and they see in black and white.  In addition, the retina has three different types of cells. One of the three types of cells are cone cells, which are responsible for color vision. The three cone cells are sensitive to three different wavelengths of light: red, green, and", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 1.

Lack of education,", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: In the 1980s, the US government had a massive budget deficit and was facing a debt crisis. In order to pay for the debt, the government had to make some cuts. Since the government was the largest employer in the US, they had to make cuts in the size of the government. The government cut the size of the government by making the government smaller, but also making it less expensive to run. The internet was relatively new and was cheap to use. This was a way for the government to save money, but also to be able to work more efficiently. This is why", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cabbage is 92% water. When you add salt to it, it causes the water to come out of the vegetable. The salt has a higher concentration than the water, so it causes the water to evaporate, which is why it releases water over time. The same is true for other vegetables, such as zucchini. They contain about 94% water, so they will also release water when salt is added.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Wrinkly: Our skin is composed of a protein called collagen. Collagen is a protein that gives the skin its strength and structural integrity. When exposed to water, the water molecules are attracted to the collagen. They absorb the water and expand. The result is a loss of collagen and the skin gets a wrinkly appearance.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because the Moon is 384,400 kilometers from Earth, but the equipment is only 2.5 meters away.  Because the Moon is so far away, the light from the equipment on the Moon is very dim and would be difficult to see, even if it were visible.  The equipment is also about 1 meter away from the surface, so it is hard to see due to the dark surface.  The Apollo astronauts also painted the equipment and the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) white, making them hard to see against the dark surface of the Moon.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you drink a liquid, you are swallowing water molecules. This water is lost to the environment, and your body must compensate for this water loss by drawing water from the cells, which can cause dehydration.  Dehydration is a state in which the body does not have enough water to carry out its normal functions.  When dehydration occurs, the body uses the water in cells to support bodily functions.  When this happens, the cells begin to shrink, and the body begins to lose the water that it needs to function properly.  Since the water in", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hispanic is an ethnicity. Latino is an ethnicity or an identity. Hispanic refers to a nationality or a region, while Latino refers to a group of nationalities or a cultural identity. However, many people use the term Hispanic to refer to the Latino identity. \n\nSomeone from the United States with a Hispanic ethnicity may speak English as their first language, but they would still be considered Hispanic. For someone from the United States with a Latino identity, they would speak Spanish as their first language.\n\nSomeone from Latin America", "\n\nHuman: Why do different countries have different outlets?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason for different outlets in different countries is that there are different standards in different countries.  The standards that determine whether a country has a certain type of outlet are based on the country's power supply, the country's climate, and the country's culture.  These are the standards that determine the type of outlets that a country will have:\n\n* 120 V and 230 V (European standard) in Europe\n* 100 V and 120 V (North American standard) in North America\n* 100 V, 1", "\n\nHuman: How exactly does a terror organization claim responsibility for an attack?\n\n\n\nAssistant: For a terror organization, the claim is typically done by one of two ways. The first is a written or oral declaration by the organization or one of its representatives, or by one of its spokespersons. The second is by the act itself, which is often done by a bomb in a car, a suicide bomber, a letter, or even a written note. Sometimes the act is done in a place that is well-known to the public, such as an airport, stadium, or public building. Sometimes the act is done in a place that is known to the organization, like a military base", "\n\nHuman: The Monty Hall Paradox/Problem\n\nI was inspired by reading [this comment](_URL_0_) as well as the explanation given in the movie 21.\n\nThe basics of the problem, taken from the link above:\n\n >  the monty hall paradox, you are given a choice of three doors with a prize behind one, you pick door #3. door #2 is opened, there is nothing behind it. you are given the the choice to switch your choice from door #3 to door #1, doing so increases your chances of winning every single time.\n\nI know this has been posted before, but I can't for the life of me wrap my head around it.

We recommend that you leave tor windows in their original default size.\"\n\nHow exactly does that work?\n\nAssistant: One way to track your monitor size is to have a website ask you to set your monitor size as part of the login process, for example, by asking you to type in your monitor size in pixels or inches.  This allows the website to determine whether you're using a laptop or a desktop, which can be used to track you.  The other way websites can track your monitor size is by having a website use JavaScript to detect your monitor size.  The website may use JavaScript to set the size of the browser window to match the size of your monitor.  Because this is done on your computer, it will be difficult to", "\n\nHuman: How bad is the U.S.'s education really?\n\nI can't seem to find any good sources on the notion that the U.S. sucks at education?

Anyone familiar with this area?\n\nAssistant: Here are some sources you can look at:", "\n\nHuman: Why does it take two separate machines to wash and dry clothes? Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The washing machine and dryer are separate machines because they do different jobs. The washing machine uses water and detergent to remove the dirt from the clothes. The dryer uses a heated air to remove the water from the clothes and make them dry. If you tried to make one machine that washed and dried the clothes at the same time, the clothes would not be clean, and they would be very wet and smelly. The dryer is used because it can remove water from the clothes very quickly, and it can do it without the clothes smelling bad. \n\nThe washing machine is", "\n\nHuman: From crack to current, what is the story behind Toronto mayor Rob Ford?\n\nWhat has Toronto mayor Rob Ford been accused of doing?

This makes your skin feel cold, as it is actually very hot. The reason we can feel hot is that our skin is very good at sensing temperature changes, and we can feel temperature changes even when our skin is wet or covered in sweat. When your skin is wet, it is actually warmer than when it is dry, as the evaporation of sweat cools the skin. This is why you get hot and sweaty when you are running and your skin feels", "\n\nHuman: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: People ask questions they already know the answer to because they want to hear your response. This is called the \"Yes/No game\" and is often used to get people to engage in small talk.  The person asking the question does not care about the answer, but rather is hoping to get a response from the person who they are talking to.  They often ask questions that they know the answer to to make sure the person they are talking to responds.  The person who responds is often trying to avoid the person they are speaking to because they do not know what to say.  If the person who asked the", "\n\nHuman: \"It's the amps which kill you not volts.\" But, wouldn't amps be always constant for given volt, as R=V/I. (Where R of human body is same)\n\n\n\nAssistant: No. Amps are constant for a given voltage. But for a given current, the amps will vary based on resistance. (R=V/I) You can think of it like a water faucet. If the flow is constant, then the pressure will vary.\n\nSo when you plug in the guitar, you may have the same amount of voltage (110V) but because your guitar has a low resistance, the amps will be high. If you have a high resistance guitar, then the amps will be low.\n\nSo why does the resistance of the guitar matter? Because the am", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't there psychotherapists who advertise themselves as working after 5pm?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In general, therapists are not allowed to advertise themselves as 'open after hours'.

This is because they are not allowed to. \nThere are also many psychotherapists who work 5pm-9pm and are not permitted to advertise this. \nIn Canada, psychotherapists can advertise themselves as working after 5pm. \nMost therapists in Canada work 9am-", "\n\nHuman: What is fire??\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fire is a chemical reaction that creates and releases heat, light, and various gases. A fire's flame is the visible portion of the gases, which are produced by the heat of the chemical reaction.

The lungs force air out faster than the diaphragm can contract and relax, so the diaphragm tenses to increase the force of the contraction and relaxation. The tension causes the stomach to tense, which makes us feel like we need to cough to release the air in our stomachs. This is why we tense our stomachs when we cough, and why it feels like we need to cough to release the air in our stomachs"], "self_instruct": ["\n\nHuman: Explain why...(or why not?)\n\nInput: Why should I vote for Hillary Clinton?\n\nAssistant: Because she has the most experience in the White House, she has a strong track record of supporting women's rights, and she has a strong platform for dealing with climate change.", "\n\nHuman: The user is given a list of words, he needs to write sentences using the words. output the sentence index.\nInput: I like to play basketball.\n\nAssistant: 1.
