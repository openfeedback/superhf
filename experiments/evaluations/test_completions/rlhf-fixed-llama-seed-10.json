The principle states that the more precisely the position of a particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa. This principle is a consequence of the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics, as described by the uncertainty principle of Werner Heisenberg.\n\nThe uncertainty principle is a statement of the limitations on the precision of measurements of certain pairs of conjugate variables.
