How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question. \n\nAIV is an injection of fluid into a vein. \n\nWhen a person is given a medication through an IV, the medication may taste slightly different from when it is given orally. This is because when a medication is given by mouth, the medication is absorbed into the bloodstream through the stomach and intestines. When a medication is given by IV, the medication is absorbed directly into the bloodstream through a vein in the arm or hand.
