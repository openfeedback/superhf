I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pulling your back is most commonly caused by a muscle strain or tear. It can also be caused by a ligament sprain. Muscle strains and sprains can be caused by improper lifting techniques, poor posture, or repetitive movements. It can also be caused by a sudden injury. Symptoms of a muscle strain or sprain include pain, stiffness, muscle spasms, and inflammation. In more serious cases, you may experience numbness or weakness in the back, inability to stand straight, or difficulty walking.", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: The value of a currency is determined by how much that currency is traded for on the open market. Currency exchange rates are not fixed, and they are determined by the supply and demand of each currency.", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hippie lifestyle was a lifestyle of young people that started in the 1960s. They were a part of a counterculture that rejected the cultural and political norms of society. The hippie movement was the result of the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War. The term \u201chippie\u201d was first used in the San Francisco area in the 1960s. The hippie lifestyle was associated with the use of LSD, marijuana, and other drugs. The hippies also engaged in sex and prom", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: The Earth rotates about its axis once every 24 hours, and this causes the sun to rise and set. Because of this, the Earth rotates around the sun once every year. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees with respect to the plane of the ecliptic (the plane of the Earth's orbit around the sun).\nThis means that during the northern hemisphere's summer, the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, and during the winter, the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun.\nThis tilt", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers get better because the hardware and software designers have to make them better in order to make more money. That\u2019s why they release new versions of software and hardware. If they don\u2019t, their competitors will and they will lose customers.\n\nThe computer hardware and software designers use the feedback from the customers in order to make more money.", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The calculator will not show 10*10^99 because it only has a maximum of 10 digits.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: You have bad breath and bad breath is usually a sign of bad hygiene. You should make an effort to brush your teeth and floss at least twice a day. Your farts are probably the result of bacteria in your colon causing gas. You should try taking a probiotic supplement or eating more yogurt.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: The taste is caused by the presence of sodium chloride in the solution. The concentration of sodium chloride in the solution is 0.9% w/v and the solution is 0.9% w/v saline, which is a 0.9% solution.\n\nThis solution is called an isotonic solution because the concentration of sodium chloride is the same in the saline solution as it is in the human body.\n\nThe solution is isotonic and will not cause the body to retain water. When the solution is introduced into the body, it is absor", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the position and momentum of a particle can not be known simultaneously with infinite accuracy.\n\nThe equation states that in order to know the position of a particle, you must measure the particle's momentum and the uncertainty in that measurement is equal to the uncertainty in the position.\n\nThe uncertainty in the measurement of momentum is dependent upon the uncertainty in the measurement of position. If the uncertainty in the measurement of position is very small, then the uncertainty in the measurement of momentum is very small, and vice versa.\n\nThe uncertainty in the measurement of momentum is not equal to", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a concept in the physics of materials, which explains the behavior of materials which have a memory. The concept is often used in the field of thermodynamics.\n\nWhen a substance is subjected to a force, the substance will react to that force in some way. A material will have a certain amount of energy associated with it. If this energy is changed in a certain way, it will result in a certain amount of work being done. If a substance is subjected to a force, it will also have a certain amount of work done on it. If the substance is then", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: The most important difference is that Europe is not a single country but a union of many countries. This means that each country is able to implement its own laws and customs, while the EU has a common set of laws and customs that must be followed. This means that the EU is very slow to change, but also that it is very unlikely that you will be able to tell the difference between the laws in the EU and the laws in the USA.\n\nFor example, there are laws in the USA that are not allowed in the EU, such as the death penalty. There are also laws in the EU that are not allowed", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because when we are tired, we want to close our eyes and rest. Rubbing our eyes helps us to close them.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The 6-core AMD CPUs have 6 cores with 12 threads per core, while the 6-core Intel CPUs have 6 cores with 2 threads per core. The AMD CPUs have a higher core count, but the Intel CPUs have a higher thread count.\n\nSo, a 6-core AMD CPU has 6 cores with 12 threads, while a 6-core Intel CPU has 6 cores with 2 threads. The 8-core AMD CPUs have 8 cores with 12 threads per core, while the 8-", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is due to a lack of sleep, which leads to the release of histamine in the body, which leads to twitching. Histamine is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for allergic reactions and inflammation. Histamine causes the body to release other chemicals that are responsible for sleepiness and drowsiness.\n\nHistamine is released in the body when the immune system is activated, which is why this neurotransmitter is often associated with allergic reactions and inflammation.\n\nHistamine is released when the", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: It's very unlikely that a patient with terminal cancer would have no symptoms until their death. In fact, most patients experience a variety of symptoms as their cancer progresses. Some of these symptoms can be related to the cancer itself, and others are a result of treatment.\n\nMany people with cancer feel that their symptoms aren't serious enough to seek medical attention. However, any change in your body is a sign that something is wrong. If you are experiencing symptoms, it is important to see a doctor as soon as possible.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar in and of itself is not bad for you.  In fact, it is an essential part of a balanced diet.  However, it is the excess of sugar that leads to health problems, and not the sugar itself.\n\nSugar is often referred to as \u201cempty calories\u201d.  This means that the calories that sugar provides are not balanced by other nutrients.  For example, when you eat a piece of bread, you are also getting fiber and vitamins.  When you eat a piece of candy, you are only getting calories, and no other", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week. However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: Talk shows typically air five days a week, as opposed to the one day a week that a late-night show would air.

The top voted content are the most popular content. When a post reaches 4,000 votes, there is a lot of people on reddit that have voted for the content. That means that there is not a lot of people left to vote for the content.\n\nThis means that there is a large amount of people that have voted on the content and it is time to move on to the next piece of content.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It would not be able to break through because it is a solid material.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the Xbox One need a brick in between the outlet plug and the console where as the PS4 doesn't?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The PS4 does not require a power brick. The power supply is built into the console itself.\n\nThe Xbox One requires a power brick, which provides power to the console and the power supply. The power supply converts AC power from the wall into DC power that is used to power the console. The PS4 and Xbox One both use DC power and they both use 12 volts DC.\n\nThe PS4 does not have a power supply, which is why it does not require a brick. The power supply is built into the console.\n\nThe Xbox One requires a power brick, which provides", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: Chlorophyll is green because it absorbs light in the visible spectrum. In the light spectrum, all colors are reflected from an object. However, light in the visible spectrum cannot be absorbed by an object. It is only reflected.\nChlorophyll is a green pigment found in plants. Chlorophyll absorbs light in the visible spectrum. The visible spectrum contains all colors of light except the color red. The color red is not found in the visible spectrum. It is in the invisible spectrum.\n\nRed is not in the visible spectrum because it is not reflected. When red light hits an object", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The question is a little unclear. It is possible that the question is related to a runner high and how it can affect performance. In the case of a runner high, cannabinoid anandamide is one of the chemicals responsible for the feeling of euphoria. A runner high is when the runner is in a positive mood and is able to perform well because of the euphoric feeling.\n\nHowever, a runner high is not the same as being high on THC (the chemical in marijuana). A runner high is not caused by THC. Rather, a runner high is caused", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Liquids are substances that have a relatively low viscosity, a measure of a liquid's resistance to flow. For example, water has a viscosity of 1.0 mPa\u00b7s at 25 \u00b0C and human blood has a viscosity of 1.5 mPa\u00b7s at 37 \u00b0C. Viscosity is an important property of liquids, and it is an important consideration in the design of piping systems and engines.\n\nThe viscosity of a liquid is measured by the time it takes for the liquid to flow a given distance", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: The stock price of Skyfleet Airlines was being artificially inflated by Le Chiffre, who owned a large portion of the airline's stock.

Why?\n\nAssistant: Because restaurants have a lot more resources than you do, and they have access to a lot more ingredients and preparation methods.  They have better equipment and trained cooks.  They have specialists to make sure everything is made correctly and served in the correct way.  It's hard to replicate that at home.  If you're really trying to recreate a restaurant dish, you're probably not going to be able to do it.  The food is going to taste very different.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because our eyes do not have the ability to focus on objects at a great distance, our eyes have to work harder to do so, which leads to a tired eye muscle.", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is a type of soda that is carbonated.

It is considered to be an extreme right-wing ideology.\nCommunism is a left-wing ideology that promotes socialism and the common ownership of the means of production. It is considered to be a left-wing ideology.\n\nFascism is a form of government that involves strong authority by a dictator. It is characterized by nationalism, militarism, and a strong central government. The main", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The way you experience time is different because of relativity. You cannot travel faster than the speed of light, so if you could travel the galaxy in one year, you would be traveling at a speed of light. At that speed, time would pass slower for you than for someone on Earth. When you return, time would pass more quickly for you than for someone on Earth.\n\nSo, for you, time passes at a rate of 1 year = 20 earth years. For someone on Earth, time passes at a rate of 1 year = 1 earth year.\n\nYou would not age any", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 1 meter is defined as the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 second.\n\nThe meter was originally defined as the distance between two marks on a bar of platinum-iridium alloy that was deposited in the 1880s at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France.\n\nIn 1960, the meter was redefined as the distance traveled by light in vacuum in 1/29979245", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, the pain of things like getting soap in your eye when you are a child is due to the fact that your nerves are still developing and are not yet fully developed. This causes the nerves to be more sensitive and therefore the pain is more intense. As you grow up, the nerves become more numb and the pain of things such as getting soap in your eye becomes less intense.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's not that scientists can't confirm the existence of Planet X. There are several methods they use to do so, the main two being direct observation and gravitational perturbation.\n\nIn direct observation, scientists use spacecraft to observe a planet. This is difficult to do with Planet X because it is so far away. There is also no spacecraft that has the ability to reach Planet X.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: I believe you are asking about the Cyprus conflict.\n\nThe Cyprus conflict is a dispute over the island of Cyprus, which has been divided since 1974 into the Greek Cypriot-controlled southern part and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern part.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: The reason is that, by the very nature of archaeology, most remains are found in the ground, which is why they are often discovered in graves. This is because they are usually buried with the deceased. If the remains are found in graves, they are usually in a good condition, since they are in the ground. This is why there are more remains of children than of adults, because children are buried with the adults.\n\nIf the remains are not found in graves, they are usually found in natural caves, which is why the children are in good condition. This is because they are", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Lions and humans have very different appearances.", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: A coin toss is a random event, so the probability of heads is 50%.\n\nThe probability of getting tails on the next flip is 50% regardless of what happened on previous flips, because a coin is a random event.\n\nBecause of the random nature of the coin flip, it is impossible to know which way the coin will land.\n\nA coin is a random event, which means the probability of heads is 50% and the probability of tails is 50%.\n\nThis means that the probability of the next flip is 50%,", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun was a very simple device. It had a light source, a lens, and a light detector. The lens would focus a beam of light onto a light sensitive detector. The detector would send a signal to the NES console when the light beam was broken. The NES would then know what to do with the light.\n\nThe NES light gun was first used in the 1987 game Duck Hunt.

Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense.

The immune system uses a number of different mechanisms to fight off viruses. One of these mechanisms is the production of antibodies. The antibodies produced by the immune system attach to the surface of the virus and prevent it from multiplying. This can be a very effective mechanism, but it is not always the case.\n\nOur immune system is also able to produce cells that can kill off the virus.

It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: Anime and manga tend to focus on young adults and teenagers, because the protagonists are often young people who go on a journey of self-discovery. This is especially true for protagonists who start out in a relatively normal life, but experience extraordinary events that change them or their worldview.\n\nFor example, Naruto starts as a shy and unsure boy, but grows into a strong and confident adult.

Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Vietnam War was a tragic and terrible conflict that divided the nation and claimed more than 60,000 American lives. The majority of those who avoided serving did so by claiming conscientious objector status. In fact, the vast majority of those who avoided the draft were not opposed to war in general, but they opposed the war in Vietnam. The draft was reinstated in 1964, just after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which is believed to have been the false pretense used by the Johnson administration to justify the war.

During cooking, the protein in the meat breaks down into amino acids. Shrimp is mostly white, which means the protein is un-denatured. Denatured proteins have a different structure and can not be digested by humans. Therefore, the protein in the shrimp is not broken down, so it stays white. When you cook red meat, the protein is broken down into amino acids, so it turns brown.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: The calculator is not capable of dividing by zero.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because it tastes better and is more convenient.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: I was able to find this answer on a Reddit thread. The explanation is as follows:\n\nIn Iran, the belief is that the soul is male or female, not male or female body.\n\nThis belief comes from the Islamic belief that mankind was created from a single soul that was split into two halves.\n\nBecause of this belief, Iran has a more accepting attitude towards transsexuality than many other countries.\n\nIt is worth noting that this is a minority view in Iran, and that the majority of people would consider transsexuals to be mentally ill and in need", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine?
