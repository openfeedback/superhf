Hair follicles are also sensitive to the female hormone estrogen, and estrogen is produced in the body in response to androgens. This explains why hair loss can be caused", "\n\nHuman: the mechanism allowing or causing flowers to track the sun as it moves across the sky.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, but I can't understand your answer.

The energy is usually electricity, which is produced by burning coal, gas or oil. As the temperature goes down, the air becomes colder, and the air gets thicker. Thicker air means that it takes more energy to push the air out of the way, and so it takes more energy to move the train.", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing.

For example, the largest whale on record was a blue whale and it lived for about 80 years. In comparison, the smallest mammal is the bumble bee and it lives for only about 12 months. The reason is that smaller animals have a higher metabolic rate and require more energy to maintain their body temperature. Larger animals have lower metabolic rates and can maintain their body temperature with less energy.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver stores bile in the gallbladder, and the gallbladder releases bile into the small intestine to help digest fats. Bile is a mixture of water, bile salts, cholesterol, bilirubin, and lecithin. The liver produces bile, which is stored in the gallbladder. The gallbladder releases bile into the small intestine, where it aids in the digestion of fats.

When you eat it, your stomach produces stomach acid, which digests the food. This acid is strong enough to break down the food, but not strong enough to break down the proteins that cause you to feel full. This means that you will feel full for a long time.\n\n Chinese and Mexican food are both sp", "\n\nHuman: How and why did Pokemon win the popularity contest against Digimon?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pokemon's popularity is still strong today.
