They are usually conducted outside of the building where the person of interest is located, and are often held after a public announcement has been made. The person being interviewed is usually a public figure, like a politician, a member of the royal family, a celebrity, a sports person, or a business person. A press conference is not a debate or a discussion. It is a formal interview, where the journalist asks questions, and the person being interviewed answers. A press conference is usually not a one-on-one interview", "\n\nHuman: Scientology\n\nWhat is it? Why is it so bad? or such a big deal?\n\nAssistant: Scientology is a cult that was founded by a science fiction writer, L. Ron Hubbard, in 1953. It is a self-help system that teaches you to improve your life through a series of mental exercises, called \"auditing\". Scientology's teachings are not based on any kind of scientific evidence and are considered to be pseudoscience.

That seems counter-intuitive, since it's the irrational numbers that are infinitely \"moving.\" Please help me understand.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The number line is a one-dimensional space. The dart represents a two-dimensional object. It is not a dart that is moving infinitely, but the dart and the number line. The dart is moving towards a number on the number line, so you can think of it as a vector. The number line is a one-dimensional space, so the dart can't move infinitely. It has to move towards one number or another. The number line is infinitely long, so the dart can only move towards one number at a time. The number it hits will be a rational number.", "\n\nHuman: ELI5: how can babies in the womb spend weeks to months upside down without issue but any person outside of a womb would experience effects or even death in less than a few days?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Babies in the womb are protected by the amniotic sac.

Babies also move inside the womb to help them develop. Babies inside the womb are not upside down. Babies in the womb are very secure and protected. Babies outside the womb are not protected. Babies outside the womb are exposed to the environment.

Proteins are more rigid than starches, so when eggs are boiled, the proteins harden. Pasta is more flexible, so when it is boiled, it softens.", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I don't understand the question.

The definition of a circle requires that the distance from the center to any point on the circle be equal to the radius of the circle. It is impossible to have a perfect circle because the distance from the center to any point on the circle cannot be a fixed length. This is because if the distance from the center to any point on the circle is a fixed length, then the distance from the center to any other point", "\n\nHuman: what's the difference between the blue circle and the check mark and the white circle and the check mark ( on messenger )\n\nI understand that there is a difference between sent and delivered, but what does that difference mean?\n\nAssistant: Sent is when the message is written and delivered is when the message is sent to the recipient.", "\n\nHuman: Explain: The Internet\n\nAssistant: The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide.

This is done by placing a device on a pad or mat that has a coil inside it. The coil creates a magnetic field that induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the device's coil, which is then used to charge the device. This is also known as magnetic induction.", "\n\nHuman: What are sensitive teeth? My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth are the result of exposed dentin, the bone-like tissue below the enamel that protects the teeth. The dentin contains a bundle of tiny tubes called the tubules that connect the tooth to the nerves in the gums. When the enamel is worn away by tooth brushing, acidic foods, or acidic mouthwashes, the tubules become exposed, causing pain.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: Hair is made of a protein called keratin. Keratin is a tough, waterproof material that is used to make horns and claws on animals. Hair is made of the same material as fingernails. Because keratin is waterproof, hair cannot absorb water very well. When hair is wet, water can enter the hair shaft. The water causes the hair to swell up, which makes the hair feel soft and smooth. When hair is dry, the keratin is less flexible and it makes the hair feel stiff and rough.", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it?

The demand for a currency is the total number of units of that currency that people want to buy. The supply and demand for a currency determines its value.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: It is because of the water molecules.\n\nWater molecules are polar, meaning they have a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other end. The positive end is attracted to the negative end, and the negative end is attracted to the positive end. This creates a bond between water molecules. When water molecules are in contact with each other, they form a strong bond. This bond is what gives water its unique properties. It is what makes water wet. It is what makes water float on top of oil, and it is what makes it hard to get out of a pool.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The way you experience time is a result of your location in the universe, yes. The reason for this is that time is not a constant, but a variable that depends on your location in space. \n\nThe reason for this is that time is not a constant, but a variable that depends on your location in space.

I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: The most common answer to this question is because of the target audience of manga/anime. Manga/anime are made for children, so they will usually have a child as the main character. They are also targeted towards young adults, so they will usually have a teenage character as the main character.", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a state of torpor, a form of dormancy in which an animal's metabolic rate is decreased to conserve energy, and its bodily functions are suspended. In animals that hibernate, the heart, lungs and breathing rate are greatly reduced, and the animal's temperature drops to between 3 and 15 degrees Celsius. This decreased body temperature helps the animal to conserve energy by slowing down the rate of chemical reactions in the body. The body also conserves energy by using less oxygen. This is called anaerobic", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because understanding a language is easier than speaking it.", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: They don't.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The Neanderthal genome has been sequenced, and the information is available to scientists.  The question is how to use it.  The first thing that has to be done is to sequence a human genome, and to compare it to the Neanderthal genome.  This will give us a better understanding of the differences between humans and Neanderthals.
