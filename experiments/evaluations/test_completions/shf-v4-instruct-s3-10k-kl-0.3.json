What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Trains pull cars by using a locomotive, which is a powered vehicle that pulls the cars. Locomotives use diesel engines, or they can be electric. Diesel engines are more common because they are more powerful and can pull more weight than electric engines. Diesel engines are also more fuel efficient than electric engines, and they are more reliable than electric engines. Diesel engines can also be used to power other vehicles, like trucks and buses. The maximum weight that a train can pull depends on the type of train and the type of locomotive it uses.

They are responsible for adjusting the amount of light that enters the eye. When light enters the eye, the pupil dilates in order to let more light in. This helps the eye see better in dim light. The pupils also dilate when a person is in the dark, or when a person is afraid. When the pupils dilate, the iris relaxes and the pupils open wider, allowing more light to enter the eye.

Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a state of dormancy in which the body uses less energy and the heartbeat slows down. It is a natural state of hibernation, which helps animals survive the winter. In hibernation, the animal's body temperature drops and the heart rate slows down. The animal usually sleeps during this time. In the spring, the hibernating animal wakes up. It recovers its strength and its body temperature goes back to normal. Animals that hibernate are usually mammals that are cold-blooded.

What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Banks offer interest on deposits because they need to get a return on their investment. Banks invest their money in a variety of investments, including stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments, to get a return on their money. The interest they receive on these investments is what allows them to offer interest to their customers. The more money they have invested, the more interest they can offer, and the more money they can make.\n\nIn addition, banks offer interest because they want to attract customers to their bank, and they want to retain existing customers. Banks want to attract new customers so they", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Income inequality has been a concern for American society since the Industrial Revolution, when the country's economy began to change from an agrarian economy to a more industrial one. The Industrial Revolution led to a rapid increase in the demand for labor, and this was met by the availability of more workers, due to the migration of people from rural areas to cities in search of work. As a result, wages fell for most workers, and those at the top of the income distribution saw their incomes increase. This trend has continued, and today, the income of the top 1% of Americans is about 2", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge?

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Sorry.\n\nIn mathematics, a significant digit or significant figure is a digit used to express a number in a way that indicates how accurate it is. Significant digits are used to indicate the precision of a number in a measurement, a calculation, or a recorded value. A significant digit is a digit that can be used to distinguish a number from other numbers. Significant digits are important because they indicate how accurate a value is. For example, the number 2.34 is less accurate than the number 2.345 because the latter has more significant digits. The number 2.345 is", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Yes, your saliva and pancreas help break down fats, but you also need bile. Bile is a fluid that your liver makes and stores in your gallbladder. Bile helps break down fats so that your body can absorb them. When your liver makes bile, it mixes it with water from your blood to make it into a liquid. The bile goes into your gallbladder, where it waits for food to come along.\n\nWhen you eat fat, your gallbladder contracts and sends the bile into your small intestine.", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: Sorry.\n\nIn natural language processing (NLP), a parser is a program or component of a program that takes as input a sequence of tokens and outputs a parse tree or a parse graph, a representation of the input sequence as a set of nodes connected by edges, where each node is a symbol and each edge is a relationship between two symbols.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cut vegetables release water because they have a high water content, and when salt is added to them, it draws out the water. Vegetables have a high water content because they are made up of mostly water and a small amount of other components. When a vegetable is cut, it loses water because the cells in the vegetable are broken open. The cells of a vegetable are made up of mostly water, so when they are broken open, they release their water into the surrounding area. When salt is added to a vegetable, it draws out the water from the vegetable, causing it to lose", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water is a polar molecule, and so has a negative end and a positive end.
