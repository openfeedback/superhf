Diamond is the hardest natural material in the world, with a hardness of 10. It is a good material for cutting glass. Diamond is formed in the earth's mantle under extreme heat and pressure. When it is brought to the surface it is polished and used in jewelry. Diamond is made up of carbon atoms. When two diamonds are forced together, they scratch each other. This is because diamond is very hard. The diamonds cannot break each other because diamonds are made of carbon atoms and the carbon atoms are not strong enough", "\n\nHuman: Why does the Xbox One need a brick in between the outlet plug and the console where as the PS4 doesn't?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Xbox One has a power supply brick because it needs a large amount of power to function properly.  The PS4 uses an external power supply, but doesn't need as much power.  The PS4 needs to be plugged into the wall and the Xbox One needs to be plugged into a power strip.

The power brick is plugged into a power strip", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: Chlorophyll is green because it absorbs blue light.  In the process of absorbing the blue light, it also absorbs some red light.  The remaining light that is emitted is green light.  The pigment absorbs the blue light to be used in photosynthesis.  The green light that is emitted is not absorbed by anything and is emitted.  The green light is the only light that is emitted and is the only light that is visible to the human eye.  The red light that was absorbed is not visible to the human eye.  The blue light that was", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Cannabinoid anandamide binds to CB1 receptors in the brain. However, CB1 receptors are not located in the lungs, so if you breathe cannabinoid anandamide, it will not cause a positive THC test. Cannabinoid anandamide is also not a metabolite of THC, so it will not cause a positive THC test.\n\nRunner's high is caused by endogenous cannabinoid anandamide that is produced in the brain and binds to CB1 re", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A liquid is a substance that has a definite volume, but flows freely and takes the shape of its container. Liquids are sometimes referred to as fluids. The other two states of matter are solid and gas. A solid is a substance that has a definite volume, but does not flow freely and takes the shape of its container. Gases are also not fluid. They flow freely and take the shape of the container they are in.\n\nA liquid is less dense than a solid or a gas, so it will float on top of the other two states of matter.\n\nA liquid has a definite volume,", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre is trying to gain access to a large amount of money (the Skyfleet stocks) in order to cover his gambling losses.\n\nLe Chiffre had previously lost a large sum of money at the Casino Royale in Montenegro.\nHe had been gambling with the money of his employer, the SMERSH organization.\nLe Chiffre had been gambling to try to pay off his debt.\n\nBecause of this, the SMERSH organization wanted to take the money back.\nSo Le Chiffre was forced to", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: A mouse is a small hand-held device that is used to control the cursor on a computer screen. The mouse has two buttons. The left button is typically used for selecting items and the right button is used for performing actions or providing input.\n\nThe mouse is connected to the computer by a cable. The mouse uses a small optical sensor to detect movements in two dimensions. The mouse sends these movements to the computer, which translates them into cursor movements on the screen. The mouse uses a small ball that spins inside a small box to sense the movement. The ball has a small hole in the bottom, and as the", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a few ways to get around this, and it depends on how the scene is being filmed. The easiest way is to use a special camera called a reflector, which is a mirror that has been placed behind the actor. This is the most commonly used method, and you can see it in movies and television shows all the time.\n\nAnother way to avoid the camera is to use a camera that can be placed in the mirror, such as a video camera or a digital camera. This is very common in television shows that are filmed in a studio, and it can also be used in movies.", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Circumcision, or the removal of the foreskin of the penis, is a common procedure performed in the United States. It is commonly done to newborn boys shortly after they are born. Circumcision is believed to have many benefits, including decreasing the risk of urinary tract infections, penile cancer, and sexually transmitted diseases. In addition, circumcision has been shown to reduce the risk of getting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. There is also some evidence that circumcision can decrease the risk of prostate cancer.\n\nHowever, circumc", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Chess has a finite number of possible moves (20) and a finite number of possible board states (64). Go has an infinite number of possible moves (200) and an infinite number of possible board states (200). The difference is that Go has an additional variable: the number of stones in each player\u2019s territory. Because the number of stones is a continuous variable, it is impossible to count the number of possible board states.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: The main difference is that Chinese food that is made at home tends to be made with ingredients that are more accessible, and so it tends to be lighter on the spices and the seasonings.  The Chinese food that you get in a restaurant is usually more authentic,  and that means it's usually more spicy,  and that's why it tastes so much better.\n\nChinese food tends to be pretty heavy on the spices,  and when you make it at home,  you tend to leave some of the spices out,  so it's not as good.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Squinting is a natural reflex of the eyes. It is a defense mechanism that is meant to protect the eyes from strain. When squinting, the eyes are narrowed to allow only a small amount of light to enter the eye. This is done in order to prevent damage to the retina. It also reduces the amount of light that enters the eye, which helps to preserve the eye's sensitivity to light.\n\nThe eyes are designed to be able to focus on objects that are close to the eyes. When the eyes look at a distant object, the muscles of the eye must work harder", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is a soft drink made by dissolving carbon dioxide under pressure in water. The water is then filtered and bottled. The carbon dioxide gas dissolves in water to form carbonic acid. This acid can be neutralized by adding a base such as sodium bicarbonate. This chemical reaction is called the neutralization reaction.\n\nCarbonated water is often called soda water or sparkling water. It is often used as a mixer for alcoholic drinks.\n\nCarbonated water is commonly sold in stores in 12-ounce bottles.", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Americans spell their words differently to British English because of the way that the English language has evolved over time. America is a new country and is a lot larger than Britain, so the English language in America has changed over time to suit the needs of the people who live in the country. There are many different reasons why this is the case, but the most important one is that Britain and America are two separate countries, so the words that they use and how they use them is different. In Britain the spelling of words is decided by the government. They have a group of people who decide which words should be spelt a certain way", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water temperature is mainly controlled by the amount of hot water, the temperature of the cold water and the type of shower head. The water temperature also depends on the type of heating system.\n\nThe shower head is the most important factor that determines the water temperature. The water temperature is influenced by the size of the holes in the shower head. Larger holes let more water through. The pressure of the water through the holes also affects the temperature. Water pressure is influenced by the flow rate of the water. The temperature of the water decreases when the water is in motion. If the water is moving too", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014. What has happened during the last 12 months? Is the situation better or worse?\n\nAssistant: ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) is a Sunni extremist group that has declared a caliphate and is fighting against Shia Muslims and Kurds in Syria and Iraq. ISIS was formed in 2013 from an alliance of several groups including al-Qaeda.\n\nISIS gained a lot of media attention during 2014 after it took control of large parts of Syria and Iraq, including the cities of Mosul and Tikrit.

It provides the artist with management, distribution, and financial assistance. A record label is usually an independent company or a subsidiary of a larger company.\n\nRecord labels are usually established by managers of artists who have already established themselves in the music industry. Record labels are a great way for artists to establish themselves in the music industry. Record labels provide artists with professional management, help them get studio time, and provide them with opportunities to perform on national stages. They can also help artists get discovered and gain a larger following.\n\nRecord labels help bands in many", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Trains pull cars using a locomotive, which is a powered vehicle that pulls the cars. The locomotive can be powered by steam, diesel, or electricity. The power source is called the prime mover. The locomotive is connected to the cars with a series of rails. The locomotive pulls the cars by creating friction between the wheels and the rails. When the locomotive pushes against the train, the wheels turn, and the train moves. The train can pull as much weight as the locomotive can push. The limit is usually 25,000 tons,", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are many methods for translating ancient texts into modern text. The most common method is to use a translation dictionary. A translation dictionary is a list of words and their definitions. The words on the list are from ancient texts and the definitions are from modern texts. A translation dictionary can be used by a person or it can be used by a computer program. Translation dictionaries are useful for translating modern texts into ancient languages and vice versa.\n\nFor example, if we have a text that says, \"the king rode on a horse\", a translation dictionary can be used to translate the text into \"the king rode on", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Hydrated chemicals are much more volatile than their dry counterparts. Volatility refers to how easily a chemical can turn from a solid, liquid or gas into a vapor. Chemicals that are more volatile have a shorter time until they turn into a gas. Volatile chemicals are also more likely to smell.\n\nVolatility is determined by the chemical structure of the molecule. Some molecules have a lot of bends and twists, making it difficult for them to turn into a gas. Other molecules are very simple and straight, making it easier for them to turn", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator and the largest and most complex scientific instrument ever constructed. It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008 in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries, as well as hundreds of universities and laboratories.

Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fascism is an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing ideology. Fascists believe that the state should be strong and centralized, and that society should be subordinate to the state. Fascists believe in promoting the power of the nation and the authority of the state through a totalitarian state. They advocate a state-led economy. Fascism rejects the idea of class conflict and is hostile to socialism, communism, capitalism, and liberalism. Fascism promotes the use of violence and aggression in order to improve the national or ethnic group, while", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: It's not possible to travel between different galaxies because each galaxy is a different universe and our current understanding of physics does not allow travel between universes. The closest we can get is the theory of a multiverse, which says that there are an infinite number of universes that exist in parallel to ours. However, our universe is the only one we know of that allows for life to exist. \n\nOur understanding of time is that it is a property of our universe, so there is no way to travel between different universes. However, we do know that time is relative to the observer, so if you", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is defined as the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second. This definition was adopted by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960. Prior to this, there were many different definitions of the meter in use around the world. The meter was originally defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator. In 1930, the meter was redefined as the distance traveled", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you are little, your eyes are more sensitive to things that can cause pain. For example, your eyes are more sensitive to light, which is why they hurt when you get soap in them. As you get older, your eyes become less sensitive to light and pain.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The existence of the hypothetical planet, which is called \"Planet Nine\", has been proposed by scientists to explain the presence of a mysterious force that causes the orbits of the dwarf planet Eris and other distant objects in the Kuiper belt to be tilted at a 90-degree angle to the plane of the solar system.\n\nPlanet Nine is about 10 times the mass of the Earth, and is thought to be about 100 times further from the sun than Neptune.\n\nPlanet Nine is a hypothetical", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A newly-mated male black widow spider may eat its partner if it is a male. The male black widow spider is typically 1/20th the size of the female and is usually eaten by the female after mating. The male black widow spider is also typically the first to die of the pair after mating, and cannibalism is not uncommon.\n\nThe female black widow spider is typically 1/4th the size of the male and will continue to feed on its mate in order to grow and produce eggs.\n\nCannibal", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Lemons and limes are not sweet. They are sour. Their sourness is so intense that animals do not want to eat them. But the sourness is not so strong that it prevents them from being transported. The seeds in lemons and limes are covered in a very thin, hard layer of tissue. The hard layer protects the seeds from being eaten. It is thin enough to be penetrated by the teeth of animals that eat the fruit. But it is strong enough to prevent the seeds from being carried away by the animals. The hard layer prevents the seeds", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: Product placement in movies is a marketing technique where products, brands, services, and organizations are featured in movies and television shows. The purpose of product placement is to increase the product's brand awareness and encourage consumers to purchase the product. Product placement is used in movies, TV shows, and even video games. \n\nThe amount that a movie is paid to include product placement varies, depending on the value of the product and the type of product.

My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: Horses are usually killed if they are in a condition that is not treatable or recoverable. For example, if a horse breaks its leg, it is usually euthanized. There are also other reasons such as the horse is too old to be used for breeding, or there is a disease that cannot be cured.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: Cyprus is split in two due to the Cyprus conflict, which is an ongoing ethnic conflict on the island of Cyprus between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. The conflict arose in the aftermath of the end of the British rule and the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus, when the Greek Cypriot majority of the island declared independence in 1960. A Turkish Cypriot minority in the northern part of the island, which was established after the 1974 Turkish invasion, declared itself to be the Turkish Republic of Northern Cypr", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons why archaeologists find more remains of children, compared to adults. Firstly, children are easier to recover from the soil, since they are smaller and lighter, and so they are less likely to be crushed by the soil. Secondly, children are less likely to be buried in an elaborate way, since they don't have much possessions, so they are less likely to be buried with objects. \n\nThere are two main ways in which children are discovered. One is through grave robbing, where grave robbers search for valuable objects to sell. However, this", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The differences between males and females in a species are called sex differences. Sex differences are important because they are the basis for sexual reproduction. In most species, males and females have different body parts. For example, male lions have manes, and females do not. These differences are also used to determine the sex of a baby. For example, babies with a penis are boys, and babies with a vagina are girls.\n\nIn humans, there are many differences between males and females. Some of these differences are more obvious than others. For example, females have a vagina and a", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Theoretically, there is no limit to the amount of information that can be sent over a wire.  In practice, there are limits on the amount of information that can be sent over a cable internet connection.  This is due to the limitations of the technology.  Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transmitted over a given period of time.  This is measured in bits per second.\n\nThe maximum bandwidth of a cable internet connection is 100Mbps.  This means that you can send 100,000,000 bits of data per second over", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Alarm clocks are electronic devices used to wake up people at a certain time. Before the invention of alarm clocks, people used to wake up at a certain time using the sound of bells, whistles, and other sounds. These devices were called time-keepers. People used to set these devices at a certain time to wake up.\n\nAlarm clocks are used to wake up people at a certain time.\n\nPeople used to wake up at a certain time using the sound of bells, whistles, and other sounds.
