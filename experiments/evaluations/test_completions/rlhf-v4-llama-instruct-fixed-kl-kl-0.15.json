And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: The reason is that we evolved on the earth and the earth rotates every 24 hours. This means that we are exposed to a certain amount of sunlight every day. In fact, if you look at the sunlight that we are exposed to, it is actually constant.\n\nHowever, the amount of sunlight we are exposed to changes as we go through the day.

The question is realistic in the sense that it is likely to happen in a book or a movie.\n\nThe reason people with terminal cancer often have no symptoms is because the cancer has spread to every part of the body. When this happens, the cancer cells in the brain may prevent the person from having any symptoms.\n\nIf the person is not having any symptoms, it is probably because the cancer is not growing or spreading. This is the case in many people with terminal cancer", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It's a generic answer, so I'm going to give a generic answer. I'm not a sound engineer so I can't really give you a specific answer, but I can tell you why I think it sounds that way.\n\nI think it's because it's a generic recording. If it's a generic recording, it's probably compressed to a very low bitrate (< 128kbps) and then encoded with a codec that's not going to sound great.\n\nI think the reason why it sounds compressed is because you're not going", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Middle East would sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar can be bad for you in many ways.\n\nThe first thing to consider is that sugar is highly addictive.  This makes it very difficult to stop consuming it.  Sugar will also increase your appetite, making it more likely that you will consume even more calories.\n\nEven if you are not overweight, consuming too much sugar will still make it harder for you to lose weight.  When you consume sugar, you are more likely to consume a lot more calories than you actually need.  In addition, the high sugar content in foods will make you hungry", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

THC is a very specific molecule that has a very specific shape that fits the receptor in the brain. Anandamide is not THC. It is a similar type of molecule, but it's not exactly the same as THC. The reason for this is that the body makes anandamide and it is a very important molecule for the body to use.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Viscosity is a property of matter that measures resistance to flow. Liquid, gas and solid materials all have different properties and each is unique to the other. Viscosity is one of the most important physical properties that affect a material's fluidity.\n\nA liquid's viscosity depends on the temperature of the liquid. When a liquid gets colder, it becomes more viscous. The molecules in a liquid are moving very quickly. However, they are also attracted to each other.\n\nAs a liquid cools, the molecules slow down and become more spread out. This causes", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Well, Le Chiffre was a well-known terrorist, and the world's stock markets were already in turmoil, so the attempted bombing did in fact cause Skyfleet's stock to drop.\n\nNow I understand why he tried to do it. He just didn't understand that the stock market is a bit like the weather, and it's not going to do what he wants.", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form?

Why?\n\nAssistant: Well,  the problem is that  the ingredients  that you have in your fridge and pantry are probably not very good.  When you go to a Chinese restaurant,  they're using high quality,  fresh ingredients.  They're using fresh vegetables,  they're using fresh meat,  they're using fresh fish,  and they're using fresh herbs.  And so,  the result is that the food tastes much better.\n\nBut when you're  cooking at home,  you're using whatever you have in your fr", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Squinting is the normal reflex of the eyes, which is often triggered by bright light. The eye muscles are designed to be able to change the focus of the eyes, from looking at something nearby to looking at something far away. The purpose of the squinting reflex is to protect the eyes from the bright light. When we squint, the pupil of the eye gets smaller to reduce the amount of light reaching the retina. This prevents the pupil from becoming overly dilated and making it more sensitive to bright light.", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is made by dissolving carbon dioxide in water and then adding carbon dioxide to water to make it carbonated.", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Americans spell their words differently from British English because they don't use British spelling conventions.\n\nThere are many reasons for this. One is that American English is a form of English that has developed over the centuries from the language spoken in the British Isles. However, it is not the same as British English.\n\nAnother reason is that American English is an evolving language. American English is more like an evolving language than British English.

A major record label can be a good option for bands that are looking to break into the music industry and have a high budget. In this case, the record label will take care of marketing, distribution, and legal costs, which can be expensive. An indie label can be a good option for bands that don't have a huge budget but still want to get their music out there. Indie labels can also be great for bands that don't need a lot of", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The limit of the amount of weight that a train can pull is determined by the amount of power it can generate. A train can only pull the amount of weight it can generate by applying a force. The more power a train has, the more it can pull.\n\nIf you want to know how a train pulls so many cars, you have to look at how much power the train generates.

For example, if a piece of text is ambiguous, it's easier to translate than one that's not ambiguous.  If the context is ambiguous, it's harder to translate.  Also, if the subject matter is ambiguous, it's harder to translate than one that is not ambiguous.  If it's a subject that is well known and well understood, it's easier to translate.  But if it's a subject that is not well understood, it", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: The smell is not amplified, but the wetness of the surface that is being sniffed is the reason for the increase in smell.\n\nIf the surface is dry, it is difficult for the odor particles to stick to the surface. However, if the surface is wet, the odor particles have a much easier time attaching to the surface.\n\nWater and other liquids are very good at transporting odor particles. If you have ever sniffed something, and then stuck your nose in a drinking glass of the same thing, you might notice that the smell is much stronger", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

Fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree. The fruit is tasty and animals are hungry.\n\nHowever, lemons and limes are a little different. They are not sweet. They are sour and bitter. They are not tasty.\n\nAnimals do not like them. Lemons and limes do not encourage animals to carry the seeds away from the parent tree.\n\nWhy?

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: It's because children are easier to preserve. When people die, they decompose, and eventually turn to dust. Children, however, are usually smaller and their bones are softer, so they decay much slower than adults. Children are also usually less mature than adults, so they don't have as many teeth and bones. This makes them easier to find and identify.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It depends on the species, and also on the physical traits that are most important in a species.

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, but I'm not familiar with the laws in your jurisdiction, but I'm pretty certain that if you're convicted of manslaughter, you'll go to prison.\n\nI know the text says manslaughter, but I'm not sure what the difference is.\n\nIt also doesn't specifically say you're in the car, but I think that's irrelevant.\n\nI'm just trying to make a point.\n\nI don't want to go to prison, so I don't smoke pot.", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived?
