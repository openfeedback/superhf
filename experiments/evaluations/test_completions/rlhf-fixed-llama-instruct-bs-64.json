The Financial Times calculated that Nokia shareholders ended up paying Elop a bonus of 1 million Euros for every 1.5 billion in market capital that Elop was able to destroy while Nokia CEO.\"\n\nI must have zero understanding of how bonuses are supposed to work. This guy is one example, but there are many others. \n\nAssistant: It's called a golden parachute. They give him the bonus because they know he will leave the company to take another job. They hope he will bring a new customer base with him, and he can't take any of the old one with him.", "\n\nHuman: Does a charge of attempted murder include all of the crimes that go into the attempt?\n\nIf you say try to murder someone by kidnapping them, beating them up and then stabbing them several times, is the kidnapping and beating and stabbing included in the attempted murder charge or are all actions charged in addition to the attempted murder?\n\nHow does the law handle that?\n\nAssistant: The crime of attempted murder is a charge that is filed when the defendant attempts to kill another person.  An attempt to commit a crime is an act that is done with the intent to commit a crime.  The defendant may have had the intent to murder, but did not actually succeed in murdering the person.  Therefore, the defendant is charged with the crime of attempted murder.  There are a number of other crimes that are included in the charge of attempted murder.  These crimes include: kidnapping, assault, and battery.  However, the defendant may be charged with additional crimes", "\n\nHuman: What are the functional differences between a Cray super computer and my 2.7GHz i7 desktop?\n\nI know technology has advanced to a point where I can buy for $500 a device with more computing power than anything built in say, 1990.  What made computers like the Cray so large and expensive, and have the features that they were designed to provide been shrunk and mass-produced with our technological progression?\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the explanations y'all.\n\nAssistant: There are a couple of factors at play here.  The most important one is the architecture of the processors.  The Cray was designed as a vector processor, meaning that it could execute many operations on a single instruction at the same time, which was useful for solving large-scale problems like weather forecasting and superconductivity.  Most modern processors today are designed to be general purpose processors, meaning that they can do any single operation at a time.  Modern processors are also designed to be very efficient, meaning that they use very little power to do a lot of work.

And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: When the earth was in its infancy, it rotated very slowly around its axis. In fact, it took 250 million years for the earth to rotate once. In that time, the sun would rise and set several times, and it would take days for the sun to rise and set at the same spot. This meant that there was little difference between night and day, and we would sleep when it was dark and be awake when it was light. As the earth rotated faster, the sun rose and set at different spots every day, and the days began to be more even. We adapted to this change", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year?

How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: That is because you are tasting the sodium chloride in the solution. When you swallow saline solution, the sodium chloride in the solution is not dissolved, but rather passes through the stomach undissolved. When the solution passes through the mouth, the sodium chloride can be detected as a taste.\n\nIn IV medications, there are many substances which are in solution, but which may not taste salty. As an example, you may notice a bitter taste with some antibiotics, and a metallic taste with some antiviral medic", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: There is no simple answer to this question, as it depends on what you mean by \"liberal\". In the US, \"liberal\" and \"libertarian\" are different political parties. In Europe, \"liberal\" means \"left-of-center\" in politics, not necessarily \"libertarian\".  The US is very \"liberal\" in its views on race and religion, but very \"conservative\" in its views on social issues such as abortion and gun control. Europe tends to be very \"liberal\" on social issues and very \"conservative\" on", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This is a complex question, and one that has been asked by many people. To begin with, it is important to understand why we get tired. We get tired when our bodies are worn out. This happens when our bodies use up more energy than they can create. When this happens, the body starts to break down, and the brain starts to send signals that we are tired. These signals can cause us to feel hungry, or sleepy, or to rub our eyes. When we rub our eyes, this can help to relieve some of the feelings of tiredness, and help us to focus. Our eyes are very sensitive", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price.

They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: AMD CPUs have a lot of cores, which means that they can handle lots of tasks at once. Intel CPUs have fewer cores, and they run slower.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know.

I'd imagine that the symptoms associated with cancer would vary from person to person, and I don't think people would just ignore them. I would also imagine that it would be hard to hide the symptoms for a long period of time, especially if you have to go to the doctor. The doctor would probably be able to figure out what's going on and treat it. I guess it's possible that you could have cancer for a long time and not know it, but", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not entirely sure.

The PS4's power supply is located inside the console, so it doesn't need to use a power brick.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: Chlorophyll absorbs light in the 600-700 nanometer range. However, that range of light is not what is most commonly emitted by the sun. In fact, the sun emits light in a much broader range, called the visible spectrum.\n\nThe visible spectrum is a spectrum of electromagnetic radiation that is visible to humans. Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that is emitted and absorbed by matter, and the visible spectrum extends from about 400 nanometers to about 700 nanometers.\n\nThe visible spectrum is broken", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The answer is actually that anandamide is not the same as THC, and is not an endogenous cannabinoid. Anandamide is not a cannabinoid, it is a neurotransmitter that is produced by the body. It is also called the \u201cbliss molecule\u201d because it is the neurotransmitter that is produced when you are feeling happy, and it is released during exercise. The \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d you feel when you are exercising is from endorphins released by the body.\n\nAnandamide is actually not a", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a rather difficult question to answer as it depends on the liquid in question. There are many factors that contribute to the viscosity of a liquid, which makes it difficult to determine the exact viscosity threshold. Some liquids are thinner at higher temperatures and thicker at lower temperatures, which may influence the viscosity. For example, some common liquids such as water, oil, and alcohol become thinner at higher temperatures. Other liquids such as honey and syrup become thicker at higher temperatures. The viscosity of a liquid may also change depending on the amount of", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre had a stock short position.", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: 1. The mouse communicates with the monitor by transmitting a signal that is translated into the movement of the cursor. The mouse does this by using a 2-dimensional array of infrared LEDs and a 2-dimensional array of infrared photodiodes. This array is mounted in a small box that is connected to the motherboard with a cable. The cable contains a wire that transmits the data. The array is attached to the bottom of the mouse. The mouse also contains a single small mechanical switch that is connected to the board by a cable. When the switch is pressed, it completes a", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a great question! Here are some examples of when you wouldn't want the camera in the mirror:", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer to this question is complex. It is important to understand that circumcision is a religious practice, and that many religions have specific religious reasons for performing this procedure. In America, 99% of males are circumcised, despite the fact that it is not required by law. In fact, the American Medical Association (AMA) states that there is no medical reason to circumcise a male. The AMA recognizes that circumcision is a religious and cultural practice that has been performed for thousands of years. The AMA does not recommend circumcision as a routine procedure, and it opposes", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The Chess game has a finite number of possible positions, but the Go game does not. In the Chess game, every square can be occupied by a piece. In the Go game, pieces are not restricted to squares, and in fact some pieces (e.g. stones) cannot be placed on any squares. \n\nThe finite number of positions in the Chess game is the result of the fact that the Chess pieces cannot be placed on any square other than the ones it is allowed to occupy. \n\nThe finite number of positions in the Go game is the result of the fact that the Go pieces", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: I think it's because you aren't a professional chef,  and I'm guessing you aren't using fresh ingredients.  Chinese food is very specific,  and the ingredients have to be fresh.  You'll never get the same flavor that someone who knows what they're doing will get.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When the pupil dilates, light is focused on a small area of the retina, making it more sensitive to light.  When the pupil constricts, it makes the eye more sensitive to light.  This process is called accommodation.  When the pupil constricts, it also makes the eye more sensitive to contrast and it increases the depth of focus.  This process is called convergence.  Convergence allows us to see both near and far objects.\n\nWhen we look at something far away, the image of the object is formed at the back of the eye, and the light", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water is carbonated by dissolving carbon dioxide in water. It's usually done by pumping the water into a tank where the carbon dioxide is injected.  The carbon dioxide dissolves in the water, creating carbonated water.  The water is then put into a tank with  a spout to allow for the carbonated water to be dispensed into a cup.", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The pronunciation of the H in herb is because it was originally pronounced as a letter in the English alphabet. The pronunciation of the H in words like herb and honour is because of the spelling of the word. The spelling of the words in the American English language is different from the English English language.", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: As water flows through the pipes, it loses some heat from the surrounding pipes, walls and floor. The heat is transferred to the air around the shower. The temperature of the shower water is determined by the balance between the temperature of the water in the shower and the temperature of the air around the shower.", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014.

What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are different types of trains. The locomotive pulls the train cars. This is done by applying the force of the engine to the rail cars. The locomotive is attached to the cars by means of couplers. The couplers are a mechanism which allows the cars to be connected to the locomotive. The couplers are made of a hard metal which is able to withstand the force of the locomotive. The couplers are connected to the cars by means of a chain or a rope. The train cars are made of steel and are very strong. The train cars are made of steel and are", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We can't be certain that ancient texts are translated correctly into modern text, since we can't go back in time to verify if the original text accurately reflects the intent of the ancient authors. However, the translation can be verified to some degree by comparing it with other ancient texts and other ancient documents, such as the Rosetta Stone. If we were able to find the original document, then we could compare the modern text with the original and determine if the translation is correct.", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Well, the molecules in the air are more spread out when it\u2019s wet. It\u2019s like a cloud of molecules in the air. In a dry state, the molecules are much closer together, so they\u2019re easier to sense.\n\nWet objects also have more surface area to expose the molecules, so there are more molecules in the air to sense.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that most chemical smells are volatile (they evaporate), so they are less smelly when wet.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator used to study the smallest building blocks of the universe. It is a circular particle collider located at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC is the most powerful particle accelerator in the world, and the largest machine ever constructed.\n\nThe LHC has two 7-kilometer-long (4.3 mi) circular accelerator rings that accelerate protons to 99.99% of the speed of light. The LHC also has four interaction points at which the beams are made to", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is hard to tell what is right and what is left.  There are a lot of different perspectives.  However, it is true that both fascism and communism have some similarities.  Fascism and communism are both authoritarian and  have  very high levels of control over society and the economy.  Both also have a government that has a lot of power and has a  large role in the economy.  These two political systems also have a  high level of government control.  However, communism is more about the government controlling the economy and  fascism is more about the", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Your question seems to involve a lot of assumptions, and it's not really clear what you mean by \"the way you experience time.\"  To answer your question, we need to understand more about the specific scenario you have in mind. Please let me know if you have any further questions.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is defined as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458th of a second. This definition was agreed upon by the 18th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960 and it is now the official definition of the meter. The length of the meter was first defined in 1793 by the French National Convention, using a standard prototype meter bar. This prototype bar was originally made of platinum-iridium, but today most metre bars are made of a", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because as you get older, your nerve endings become more tolerant to pain.  When you are little, your nerves are more sensitive to pain, which is why you don't like getting soap in your eye when you are little.  When you are an adult, you become more tolerant to pain, which is why you don't like getting soap in your eye when you are an adult.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We can tell you about all the planets in our solar system and even ones that are outside of our solar system because we have instruments that detect and measure light that travels from stars and planets to telescopes here on Earth. We can measure the light to tell us the distance, brightness, temperature, composition, size, etc. of the planet or star. We can tell you about the planets that orbit our sun because we have a very good understanding of how gravity works and how planets are formed. We know that planets orbit around the sun in different orbits and at different speeds. We can tell", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The black widow is not a species, it is a genus. The black widow is a spider, not a species of spider. The black widow is a spider that is found in North America, but there are many species of spider that are not black widow spiders. If you want to know the answer to your question, you need to ask a biologist.", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is not fruit in the way that we think of fruit. It is a modified leaf. The fruit of a lemon is actually the ovaries, which are protected by a modified leaf. The fruit of a lime is also the ovaries, but they are not protected by a modified leaf.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: The placement of products in movies is called product placement. Product placement is a marketing strategy to increase sales of a company\u2019s product by integrating it into the plot of a movie. The amount of money a movie maker pays for a product placement depends on how many times the product is featured in the movie. The movie maker has to specify how subtle or obvious the placement is. Product placement is a common strategy used by companies and movie makers. Most companies pay a small amount of money to the movie makers for the placement of their products. Sometimes companies will pay a large", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: Word can use several different methods to generate a link.  Some of the more common ones include:\n\n1. Clicking the link and selecting Copy\n2. Copying the link from the location bar in your browser\n3. Copying the link from a menu\n4.

My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: I believe the answer is the same for both horses and humans. Horses are expensive animals that are used for a variety of purposes. There are many reasons a horse may need to be euthanized, from an injury to an illness. The veterinarian will work with the owner to ensure that the horse is made as comfortable as possible. Horses are killed because they are expensive animals that are used for a variety of purposes. There are many reasons a horse may need to be euthanized, from an injury to an illness. The veterinarian will work with the owner to ensure that the horse", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus in 1974 was a major turning point in the Cyprus dispute. The Turkish invasion was a response to a Greek Cypriot coup d'etat, in which the Greek Cypriot military junta took over the administration of Cyprus, and to a Greek Cypriot National Guard campaign against the Turkish Cypriot minority, in which 3,000 Turkish Cypriots were massacred. The Turkish invasion was supported by the United States and the United Kingdom, who were concerned about the Soviet Union's influence", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Because they're easier to find, and in many cases, easier to identify due to their age.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The main difference between males and females of any species is their reproductive organs, which differ in both form and function.  In most animals, females are the ones that carry the offspring and males are the ones that fertilize the eggs.  In the case of human males and females, the reproductive organs are the same, but they are different in terms of size and function.  The differences between male and female human reproductive organs are what differentiate males from females.  The main difference is that the females have a uterus and the males do not.  The uterus", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's. The amount of information that can be sent over your cable Internet depends on the bandwidth of the Internet. The bandwidth of the Internet can be determined by the upload and download speeds of the Internet.\n\nInternet speed is determined by how much information can be sent per second. The more information that can be sent per second, the higher the bandwidth. Bandwidth determines the amount of information that can be sent over the Internet.\n\nWhen you are using a cable Internet service, you are connected to your Internet through a", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: They woke up when they heard the first roosters crow.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: A coin has an equal probability of landing on heads or tails, so if the first flip landed on heads, the second has a 50% chance of landing on heads and a 50% chance of landing on tails. If the first flip landed on tails, the second has a 50% chance of landing on heads and a 50% chance of landing on tails. \n\nThis is true whether it is the 1st flip, the 100th flip, or the 1000th flip.\n\nThe next", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It was a simple device. The NES light gun was a small handheld device that was shaped like a gun. It had a single trigger button, and a large plastic barrel that had a small lens. The lens was used to point the gun at the TV screen. The gun was very accurate because it was designed to work with the NES. The NES light gun was a peripheral that allowed players to play a variety of games. Some of the most popular games included Duck Hunt, Hogan's Alley, and Wild Gunman. The light gun was used for shooting", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The country would not have to deport someone if they do not have records of where they live, family, etc. However, they may still be able to deport someone if they are able to provide sufficient evidence that the person is undocumented. There may be other reasons for a country to deport someone, such as that the person is a criminal.", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\nThe reason the answer is 0 is because the percentage sign is not a real number. 0/0 is undefined, and therefore 0 divided by 0 is undefined. The percentage sign (%) is not a real number, it is an operator. The percentage sign is used to calculate the percentage of a number. For example, 50% of $100 is $50. If you divide $100 by 50, the answer is 2. However, you cannot divide 0 by 0, as the", "\n\nHuman: why does comcast Internet slow down despite offering 20+mbps\n\nAssistant: If you are using a modem provided by Comcast, then it's likely that the speed you're getting is the speed that the modem is capable of.  You can find the speed of your modem by going to https://www.speedtest.net/ and entering the information on the left.  If you have more than one device connected to the modem, you'll want to check the speed of the modem while only one device is connected.  If the speed is still below the advertised speed, then you will want to call Comcast and troubleshoot with them.  I'", "\n\nHuman: how do apps like prankdial work?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't know what you mean.", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens if you ignore medical bills? [USA]\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The law is very clear. You have to pay the bill. If you don't, you can be sued. If you are sued, you will probably have to pay attorney fees in addition to the bill. If you don't pay the bill and you don't pay attorney fees, you can have a lien placed on your assets, which means they can be sold to pay for the bill. \n\nIf you don't pay the bill and don't pay attorney fees and don't pay the lien, the hospital can take you to court and obtain a", "\n\nHuman: If I smoke pot, and a week later get in a car accident where someone dies, will i go to prison?\n\nI know whenever someone is seriously injured or killed in a car accident, both drivers blood are taken to check for intoxication.  Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: If you are driving at the speed limit, and the other person is driving in the wrong lane of the roadway, and you t-bone them, the court will determine whether or not you are responsible for the accident.  If the court finds you are responsible, you will likely be found liable for the accident.  If you are found liable, you may be held responsible for the damages caused by the accident.  This may include money for any medical bills the injured person incurs, the cost of repairing the vehicle, and the value of the property damaged in the accident.  If the court", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: This word is commonly used in the sense of \"one and other\" or \"each and every other\". It does not have the same sense as \"one another\" in the sense of \"one and the other\". It is used in such sentences as: \"I would like to speak to each and every one of you. I would like to speak to one and the other.\"", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: Well, this is a design feature of the toilet seat. The plastic bolt and wing nut are intended to prevent the seat from becoming loose during use. The plastic bolt and wing nut are also intended to be easily removed by the user in order to facilitate cleaning. A metal bolt and wing nut would be more durable, but they would also be harder to remove. They might also cause discomfort if they were too tight.", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I can give you an answer.", "\n\nHuman: If there's being such serious human rights violations goiing on in Qatar, and FIFA aren't doing anything about it, then how come none of the world governments or the UN are putting pressure on something to be done?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I would ask you to look at the FIFA website. They are doing a lot of work on the subject.  I would also ask you to look at the recent independent report by Qatar\u2019s National", "\n\nHuman: Sure Deposit\n\nI am being told that, despite having deposit in the name, it's just an unrelated fee.  I'm having trouble finding information on sure deposit, it seems like I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nAssistant: I'll be happy to help you.", "\n\nHuman: If viruses such as Ebola have no cure, how come some people recover from the disease?\n\nHow come the virus doesn't keep multiplying until it kills the person?\n\nAssistant: Viruses can multiply as long as there is a host to replicate in. Viruses are very good at finding a host to replicate in, but they are not very good at finding a host to kill. They also need a proper environment to grow.\n\nViruses can be very hard to detect in the body, so people may be infected without knowing it. Once a person is infected, the virus will find a way to enter a new host. The virus will not kill the original host because the original host is still alive and infected.\n\nA virus does not need a host to replicate in", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If you don't wake up in the morning, you will miss out on a lot of things. In the morning, you have the opportunity to wake up, do your exercise, and then go to work or school to do what you love. Also, if you don't wake up in the morning, then you will miss out on the breakfast that your mom makes for you. In the morning, you have the opportunity to eat food that you like. If you don't wake up in the morning, you will miss out on the opportunity to interact with your friends and family. In the morning, you", "\n\nHuman: Why do pupils dilate on drugs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pupils dilate on drugs when the drug enters the bloodstream and binds to the receptors on the cells in the pupil. The drug then binds to the receptors on the cells and causes the cells to release the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which causes the pupil to dilate.", "\n\nHuman: Why do most men go bald, in spite of all the testosterone?\n\nI'm 25, I have a full beard, I have new hair coming out on my back and shoulders but the hair on top of my head have started falling. What's up with that? Are the rules different for that part of the body?\n\nEDIT: What the hell? Ads about hair products started showing on reddit. Ads do get smarter. \n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

Is there a biological dofference in their libido?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not a sexologist so I can't speak for all people. However, I think that the answer to your question is that most people are willing to have sex with a stranger if they think that they will not get caught. Most people do not feel that they are obligated to disclose their sexual partners to their spouse or partners and therefore, they may be more willing to engage in such behavior. I think that this is a result of the fact that most people have a desire to be in a relationship and most people want to be in a relationship with a person that they are attracted to and that they", "\n\nHuman: We have vitamin A , B, C, D, E and K but not F, G, H, I and J. Why?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: You have vitamin A, B, C, D, E and K because they are part of the vitamin group. The vitamin group is composed of a set of nutrients that are essential for the human body, and are all required to maintain the health of the body. These vitamins are classified as vitamins because they cannot be synthesized by the body. Therefore, they must be obtained from food. Vitamin A and vitamin K are fat-soluble vitamins, while vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D and vitamin E are water-soluble", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that sometimes I can poop with perfection only needing to wipe once and other times I need to wipe multiple times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's due to the size of your poop, the consistency, and the location of the poop. If you have a bowel movement that is soft and liquid then you are likely to need to wipe a few times. If you have a bowel movement that is hard and dry then you should only need to wipe once. If you have a bowel movement that is a liquid-like mushy consistency and you are wiping with the toilet paper in an upward motion, you should not need to wipe multiple times. If you have a bowel movement that is a liquid", "\n\nHuman: What Is the Chomsky Grammar Heirarchy and How Does It Work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Chomsky grammar heirarchy is a method of describing the structure of a language. The heirarchy is based on a series of levels in which the structure of sentences is examined. The levels in the heirarchy are:\n\n0. The level of the sentence\n1. The level of the word\n2. The level of the morpheme\n3. The level of the phoneme\n4. The level of the phoneteme\n5. The level of the phoneme-symbol\n6. The level of the phoneme-sign\n7. The level of the ph", "\n\nHuman: why almost every japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children\n\nI have just noticed this trend tbh and i never wondered why this was. It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: The main characters are children because children are easier to relate to. When a character is a child, they have a lot of time to grow in the story, so the story arc is much longer. When a character is an adult, the arc is often shorter. However, when a character is an adult, the story is more relatable to adults, because they can connect to the characters on a more adult level. It is a personal preference to what the author wants, but the reason for why children are more relatable is because children are easier to relate to.", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The hibernation of animals is a form of inactivity during winter when food and other resources are scarce.  During this period of inactivity, the animal\u2019s body temperature drops, and its metabolic rate and breathing rate decrease drastically. Some animals, such as bears and other mammals, are able to lower their body temperature to 5 degrees Celsius below normal. The decrease in metabolic rate and breathing rate allows the animal to conserve energy and to slow its heartbeat. During this period, the animal is essentially in a state of suspended animation. This", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's because you have to know what you want to say and what you have to say before you can say it.  There are so many rules, and you have to know the grammar of the language, and you have to know what your message is and how to say it.  So you have to understand the language before you can say it.  The brain has to work to understand the language, and the brain has to work to say it.  So it's easier to understand a language than to speak it.", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: If you're asking how blind people are able to read braille, then I can tell you that they're taught to read braille at an early age. They start by learning the shapes of letters, and then the sounds that the letters make. Once they know how to read braille, they can read any text that is written in braille.\n\nIf you're asking how blind people know that there is a sign with braille text, then they can tell by the shape of the sign, and they can ask someone.", "\n\nHuman: What volume of water is required to drown a human?\n\nAnd a second, slightly sillier question, can someone drown swallowing only a mouthful of water?\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I don't know.

The pages are usually called\n\"end leaves\" and are usually trimmed so that they fit nicely in the back of the book.", "\n\nHuman: Meditation\n\nHow do I do it? What does it do? Does it actually work?\n\nAssistant: Hi. I'm not sure what meditation is exactly, but I believe it is a form of relaxation that involves the use of various techniques to help calm the mind and body. It is most often practiced as a technique for stress reduction and relaxation, and has been shown to have a wide range of benefits, including but not limited to:\n\n-Improved mental clarity\n\n-Improved focus\n\n-Improved sleep quality\n\n-Improved stress reduction\n\n-Improved self-awareness\n\n-Improved pain management\n\n-Impro", "\n\nHuman: Why can insurance companies charge based on race/sex/age and not be sued for discrimination?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because it\u2019s not illegal to charge based on race, sex, and age. The laws that govern how insurance companies can determine rates are different than laws that govern how private companies can determine rates.\n\nThe Insurance Act of 1938, for example, states that an insurer cannot charge a higher rate to a group of people based on their race. However, it is legal for insurance companies to charge higher rates to men than women and older people than younger people. Insurance companies base rates on the probability that a group of people will file claims.\n\nThe Age Discrimination in", "\n\nHuman: What is the dust on your eyes after you wake up?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: Hello, and thank you for asking. After waking up, the eyes are often dry and irritated due to the lack of moisture. The eyes are moistened by tears produced by the lacrimal glands. When we are asleep, we do not blink as much, which means there is less moisture on the eyes, which can lead to dryness, irritation, and eye strain. The dryness may also be caused by lack of moisture in the air, or even a lack of sleep, which affects our ability to produce tears. This can also be caused", "\n\nHuman: How would a write in candidate win a national election considering that there might be and probably are other people with the exact same name?\n\nIn the context of people talking about write in candidates for this upcoming election, I was just wondering how this works.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: The write-in candidate would have to be running as a write-in candidate.  The candidate would have to submit a paper with their name on it to the elections board and then have the ballots printed.  The ballots would then be sent to the voters.  The voter would then write in their write-in candidate's name.", "\n\nHuman: How did people used to train pigeons to carry mail at the long distance, back in the day?\n\nI was always curious, did they have different pigeon for each address and if not, how pigeon knows whom to send? \n\nAssistant: The answer is quite simple. In the mid-18th century, the first mail delivery service was established by the British government and it was carried out by pigeons. The pigeons were trained to carry messages from one place to another. They had a very high efficiency and were relatively cheap to operate. The pigeons were kept in a special place called pigeon loft and the messages were placed on a small tray, called the pigeon post. \n\nThe pigeons were then released in the air and would fly back to the loft. The messages would be picked up by the", "\n\nHuman: Why are people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war shamed instead of admired? Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think the shaming is a product of the time. It was a very divisive war, and people who served were often looked at with awe. And those who didn't serve were viewed as cowards.", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: There are three things that you need to consider when asking whether or not you could bring back a Neanderthal.  The first is the scientific feasibility of the task.  The second is the ethical feasibility of the task.  The third is the social feasibility of the task.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the science.  While the Neanderthal genome is now sequenced, there is still a lot that we don\u2019t know about Neanderthals.  We know that the Neanderthal genome is similar to the human genome, but there are differences.  We", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender person is someone who is born with a gender different from the one they identify with. A transsexual person is someone who feels that their gender is different from the one they were assigned at birth, and they may or may not have been born with that gender.", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think it's because THC in marijuana is an agonist at the CB1 receptor, which is a G protein-coupled receptor and the most abundant receptor in the brain. It's also a receptor for anandamide, the endogenous ligand for this receptor, which is a ligand for the same receptor. It's a receptor for THC and THC is the agonist for this receptor.", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The answer is that they are able to stay in business because of the large number of people in New England that are willing to buy alcohol in large quantities for personal use. The reason that they are able to sell in large quantities is that they are able to buy alcohol at a much lower price than the general public.", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Shrimp contains more water and less protein than red meat. When heat is applied, water in the shrimp boils away, leaving a protein residue that browns, while the water in the meat boils away, leaving the protein residue, which is red.\n\nShrimp also contain a compound called tryptophan, which is brown when heated.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: It displays error because that is the way it is designed.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I believe this question is based on the 2006 study, \u201cThe Social and Cultural Determinants of Fast Food Consumption in the U.S.: An Analysis of Time Use Data.\u201d The study found that people with lower incomes and lower education were more likely to eat fast food. This is because fast food is convenient and inexpensive. However, there are also many people with higher incomes and education who eat fast food more often than people with lower incomes and education. This is due to the fact that fast food is marketed to all people in a variety of ways. It is marketed through", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: The short answer to your question is that it is a result of an increasingly divided society. The more divided our society is, the more likely we are to have different views about things, which in turn leads to polarization in our politics.\n\nAs for whether this is happening in other countries, it depends on the country. In the US, we are polarized because of our history. In the US, we have two major parties (the Democrats and the Republicans) and each party is associated with a particular view of the world.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the two parties started moving", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods? Meaning, you had to live in the same block/city to connect to it? \n\n\nAssistant: That's right.  It's a service that allows you to exchange information with others using a computer.  A BBS was a centralized computer that people could connect to and share information.  The BBS would be run by someone in the area who would offer to share their computer resources to the public, for a fee.\n\nThe BBS is a precursor to the internet.  When it was first invented, it was a great way to communicate with people.  It was a lot more personal than the internet, since you could read and write messages and talk to people.\n\nIt was also", "\n\nHuman: What is Russell's paradox? and please explain like i am 5, i don't know anything.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Russell's paradox is a paradox in the logic of set theory. It states that a set of all the sets that are not members of themselves contains itself as a member, and so is either a member or not a member of itself, which is impossible because it is a member of itself if it is not a member of itself. The paradox is named after Bertrand Russell, who first described it in 1901. The paradox is the most famous of all set-theoretic paradoxes.\n\nRussell's paradox was the first paradox", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: Iran has a long history of accepting transsexuals, especially those who were born into the opposite sex. In some cases, individuals have been recognized as transgender individuals by the courts and allowed to have their gender identity legally recognized.\n\nIran has a long history of accepting transsexuals, especially those who were born into the opposite sex.

However, 32 bit systems are faster than 64 bit systems, and 64 bit systems are not required for all tasks. For example, most tasks that don't require more than 4 GB of memory do not need 64 bit. 128 bit systems are not required for any tasks, because they don't exist.", "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is because the task manager is a separate process from the application. It has its own memory and it is running independently from the application.\n\nThe application has frozen because the application is trying to access memory that is not available.\n\nIt could be because the application is using too much memory and it is trying to access the memory that is currently being used by the task manager.\n\nIt could also be because the application is trying to access the memory that was freed when the task manager was started.\n\nWhen the task manager is frozen, the application cannot access the memory that the task manager is using", "\n\nHuman: How will new gun laws prevent mass shootings?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand.", "\n\nHuman: Why do banks offer interest? What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Banks have to maintain a large amount of capital to ensure that they have the liquidity to meet their liabilities. When a bank offers a loan, it takes in the principal amount and offers a smaller interest rate. However, when the loan is repaid in full, the bank can then use that capital to make more loans.", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Income inequality in the United States is a measure of the distribution of household or individual income in a country. The term can refer to inequality between households or individuals, or inequality between countries. Income inequality is a common measure of economic stratification, or social inequality.

This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: In cold weather, the air is denser, which allows sound waves to travel farther. The denser air increases the loudness of the sound.", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure what you mean by \"correlated\" so I'll respond to the first part of your question.\n\nThere's been a lot of research on this topic, and I can't really do it justice. However, there is a clear correlation between higher education and liberalism. I'll share a few things I've learned from the research.\n\n1. There's a lot of research on this topic, and I can't do it justice. However, there is a clear correlation between higher education and liberalism.\n\n2. The correlation is not perfect. There", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Well, it's due to the way the muscles in your vocal cords work. When you speak, the vocal cords are relatively relaxed, so the sound produced is quite soft and subtle. When you sing, you have to use your vocal cords to create a sound that is louder and with more variety. The vocal cords have to be tightened and relaxed more to create these different sounds, and this takes energy, so you need to have energy in order to sing. This is why some people's voices sound terrible when they sing, because they don't have the energy to sing", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is because of the updrafts and downdrafts in the atmosphere. As a cloud passes through a downdraft it gets compressed into a smaller space, and when it passes through an updraft it gets stretched out. These forces are balanced by the upward force of gravity on the cloud itself, which is proportional to the weight of the cloud water.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because smaller animals have a relatively lower metabolic rate, and thus need less energy and resources, and can live for longer periods of time. Larger animals on the other hand, need a higher metabolic rate, and thus require a higher amount of energy and resources to sustain their life. As a result, they are unable to live as long as smaller animals.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Mom and dad are both words for parent, but the use of both words may be considered somewhat informal. In more formal speech, people often use titles such as Mr. and Mrs. instead of their first names. In speech and writing, people sometimes use Mr. and Mrs. or the equivalent titles for people who are not parents, such as aunts or uncles. However, in most cases, it is considered polite to use Mom and Dad to refer to a parent, and people may often use Mom and Dad when they speak or write to a parent. The use of Mom and", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: The significant digits are the digits to the right of the decimal place. So in your example, the significant digits would be 3 and 4. The number 25.75 has 4 significant digits.", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure of the mechanisms of the liver and bile production, but the liver does produce bile and stores it in the gallbladder. The liver is a very important organ in the body, as it produces bile, detoxifies the blood, removes toxins from the blood, and produces proteins to help maintain healthy blood cells and clotting factors.\n\nThe pancreas is also an important organ that produces bile. The pancreas has a very important role in digestion and metabolism. The pancreas produces enzymes that help", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: It is the interference between the AM and FM  radio  station  signals  which  are  on  the  same  frequency  and  the  noise  generated by the electronics of the TV. When the TV is turned on, the TV tuner is tuning in the AM station  frequency  and  the  TV  is  making  noise. When the TV is turned off, the TV tuner is tuning in the FM station frequency and the TV is making noise.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries run out of power because the chemicals inside them start to degrade. This happens over time, and is accelerated by high temperatures, as well as high current draws. This causes the batteries to not be able to store as much energy, and eventually not be able to store any at all.\n\n\\strong{TL;DR}\nBatteries run out of power because the chemicals inside them start to degrade. This happens over time, and is accelerated by high temperatures, as well as high current draws. This causes the batteries to not be able to store as", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: Maybe it's just a natural instinct?", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological theory of the origin and evolution of the Universe. It states that the Universe was in a state of extreme high temperature and density, which expanded at an exponential rate in the first fraction of a second of its existence.  A theory of this type is needed to explain the observations that 1) the Universe is expanding at an accelerating rate; 2) the Universe is uniform and isotropic on large scales; 3) the Universe contains no evidence of a previous state of non-uniformity; 4) the Universe contains no evidence", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,", "\n\nHuman: The Jerry Springer Show\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is your question?", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: These animals are often cute because they are  young and  adorable, just like humans. They also have a certain  cuddly  quality to them.\n\nIn addition, it is important to understand that many of these animals are  endangered.  Many  people  do not realize that these animals can be  very  dangerous. Even when they are not  dangerous, they can still harm people. The best way to protect people from these animals is to educate  people. When people are educated about these animals, they can be  more cautious around them.

The other is that we have always had the ability to see colour, and that we are just sensitive to different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum than other animals.", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Let's start with the definition of a 3rd world country. A third world country is a country that is poor, underdeveloped and is in the process of developing. This is based on the 1950s definition. Since then the term has changed to 3rd world countries, which are countries that are not developed but not as underdeveloped as the 3rd world countries. The countries are categorized by their GDP per capita, which is the gross domestic product divided by the population. The reason they are underdeveloped is because they are developing. There is a process of development,", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: That's because they aren't on a network.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but I do know that water is a solvent.  It dissolves things.  I think the water molecules are attracted to the salt (which is a solute) and the water moves into the salt.  Then the salt molecules are attracted to the water molecules.  You end up with the salt dissolved in water.  That's why we can't drink it directly because it's too salty.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water softens the skin, because the skin is 70% water and it tends to be soft. The more you are in water, the more your skin gets soft, because it is more hydrated. This is because your body gets hydrated and the more hydrated you are, the softer you are. Water softens skin because it is a solvent that is able to dissolve other molecules and it is a good solvent for fats. \n\nWater is also able to keep your skin hydrated, and since it is a solvent for fats, it keeps your", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The light from distant objects is not visible to the human eye, but it can be observed with telescopes. The light from objects on the Moon is visible to the human eye, but it cannot be observed with telescopes.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's important to keep in mind that all liquids can be dehydrating. If you're thirsty, you should drink water. However, if you're not thirsty, don't drink water. This can lead to water intoxication.
