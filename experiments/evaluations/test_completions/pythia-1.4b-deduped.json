The higher the aperture, the more light is reflected and the less it falls on the sensor. This effect is known as the Rayleigh criterion. The Rayleigh criterion states that the light that is reflected from an object is proportional to the square of the distance to the object. The Rayleigh criterion is the same as the inverse square of the distance. When you have a large aperture, you have a large distance and therefore a large number of reflections, which results in a smaller depth of field.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: We don\u2019t have a specific answer to that question.", "\n\nHuman: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Expiry date is the date the medicine is expected to last the longest, for example, if a medicine has a 20-year expiry date, it may not be safe to use in the first 10 years, but after the 10 years it may still be safe to use.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: You can\u2019t eat anything.", "\n\nHuman: why do giraffes have horns?\n\nI was just wondering...\nEdit: thanks for all the responses you guys even the bad ones :D And no I don't think that giraffes have ended their evolution process, your reading into it to much.\n\nAssistant: why do giraffes have horns?", "\n\nHuman: Can you change the temperature of a subject with sound alone?\n\nTo clarify I don't mean temperature produced by whatever produces the sound.
