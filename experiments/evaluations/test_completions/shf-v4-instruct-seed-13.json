How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The way you experience time depends on your location in the universe, because of the relative speed of light. When you travel far from the Earth, the light from the Sun, and the other stars, travels much slower than it does when you are on Earth. This causes the stars to appear much dimmer and much farther away, and the Sun to appear much smaller and much farther away.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: The coin flip is independent from the previous ones. \nThe probability of getting heads on a single flip is 50%. \nThe probability of getting heads on the next flip is 50%. \nThe probability of getting heads on the next flip is 50%. \nThe probability of getting heads on the next flip is 50%. \nAnd so on. \n\nCoin flips are independent, therefore the probability of getting heads on any single flip does not change from one flip to the next. \nCoin flips are independent,", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit video game console that was released by Nintendo in North America in 1985.

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?

The paradox states that if the class of all sets that are not members of themselves forms a set, then this set must be a member of itself. But if the set is a member of itself, then it is not a member of itself, and so it cannot be a member of itself. This paradox was formulated in 1901 by the British logician Bertrand Russell. The paradox has important philosophical implications regarding the nature of sets and their definition.\n\nThe paradox is named after", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: Iranian culture has a strong connection to the Persian Empire, and the Persian Empire was known for its tolerance of LGBT people.", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: Depression is a side effect of many prescription drugs. This is because some of these drugs, especially those that are used to treat mental illnesses, are thought to cause depression.\n\nDepression can also be a side effect of some medications that are used to treat physical health conditions, such as antidepressants and pain medications.\n\nDepression can also be caused by some medications, such as antidepressants.

They can hold a large amount of ammunition, which allows shooters to fire more bullets without needing to reload.\n\nBanning assault weapons", "\n\nHuman: Why do banks offer interest? What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Banks offer interest to attract customers, and to make money. Banks lend out money that customers deposit with them, and charge customers interest on the money that they borrow. The interest that banks earn is called interest income.\n\nBanks use interest to make money because they can charge more interest than the interest they pay. This difference is called the spread, and it\u2019s the bank\u2019s profit.\n\nThe more money that a bank lends out, the more interest it can earn. This means that banks need to make sure that they lend out a lot of money. For example, if", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Income inequality in the United States is the level of inequality of household or individual income distribution. Income inequality is measured using the Gini coefficient, which ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality. In the United States, the Gini coefficient for household income was 0.47 in 2018, compared to 0.39 in 1980. The Gini coefficient for individual income was 0.47 in 2018, compared to 0.40 in 1980.

If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: The purpose of those signs are to warn drivers of the height of the overpass and whether they are too tall to pass under it. The signs are usually placed at a distance of 100 feet or so before the overpass. The signs are not placed on the overpass itself, because the sign is not visible until the vehicle is very close to the overpass.\n\nThe signs are important because they let drivers know if they are too tall to pass under the overpass. If the driver is too tall, the driver needs to make a decision whether to go under the overpass or go around it. If the driver", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly. I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: The shell exploded and the blast wave from the explosion caused severe injuries to the man. The injuries included burns, which is what you described. The injuries were severe enough to kill him instantly.\n\nThe blast wave is a high pressure pulse that moves through the air at the speed of sound. The air is compressed and then expands rapidly, creating a pressure wave that travels at the speed of sound (about 770 miles per hour). The pressure wave is the energy that causes the damage to the man. It causes the air to become compressed and then expands rapidly", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: The sounds are not louder in the winter. It is simply that the air is colder in the winter, and as a result, it is denser. The denser air can carry sound better. As a result, the sound waves are able to travel farther and reach the ears of the listener.\n\nThe same effect happens in the summer, when the air is warmer and less dense. The sound waves are not carried as far and reach the listener less effectively.\n\nThe density of the air can vary due to a number of factors, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The effect is", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: A number of factors can explain why people are more likely to be liberal, democratic, or left-wing as their education increases. For one, people with higher educations tend to be more likely to be exposed to liberal ideas and perspectives. For example, many colleges and universities are known for being more liberal or left-leaning.  Secondly, people with higher educations are more likely to be exposed to liberal ideas and perspectives in their own fields of study.  Thirdly, people with higher educations tend to be more likely to have jobs that require them to think critically about issues", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: When you sing, you use your vocal cords to produce sound. The pitch and volume of the sound are controlled by the speed and tension of the vocal cords. The vocal cords are located in the larynx, also known as the voice box. The larynx is located in the throat, at the top of the trachea, and is made up of two sets of muscles, called the cricothyroid and cricopharyngeal. The vocal cords are attached to these muscles and are held in place by a membrane called the vocal ligament.\n\nThe", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Clouds are made of liquid or solid water droplets or ice crystals. The droplets or crystals are so small they are suspended in the air. When the wind blows, it causes the cloud to move. The wind also causes the water to evaporate or freeze and fall as rain or snow. The water droplets or ice crystals are so small, they can be suspended in the air even when the wind is blowing them around. Because the droplets or crystals are so small, they take up little space and don't need to be in", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: Animals with longer lifespans live longer because they have more time to reproduce. This is an evolutionary advantage because more offspring can be produced. However, smaller animals may live longer because they have a better chance of surviving environmental changes and predators. A fly, for example, can be killed by a human in a matter of seconds, but a whale can live for several decades and therefore can reproduce more. \n\nThe lifespan of animals is also influenced by their diet and the environment they live in. For example, a large animal such as a whale may eat large quantities of food and", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Mom and dad are the common names for a parent.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are the digits that are used to express the exact value of a number, rather than a rounded value. The number 22.3 has three significant digits because there are three digits that are used to express its exact value. 22.3 has three significant digits because the first digit is 2, the second is 2, and the third is 3.\n\nThe number 3.45 has one significant digit because there is only one digit that is used to express its exact value. 3.45 has one significant digit because the first digit is 3, the second", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Your liver is one of the largest organs in your body, and it helps with many functions. It is responsible for detoxification, the production of bile, and the storage of fat.\n\nYour liver has many functions. The most important function of your liver is the production and storage of bile. Bile is a substance produced in your liver that helps to break down fats.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them because the salt pulls out the water in the vegetable. This is similar to what happens when you boil vegetables.\n\nThe water in the vegetable molecules is held together by strong bonds. When you add salt, the salt molecules attract the water molecules in the vegetable and pull them away from each other. This makes the bonds weaker and the water molecules can easily escape.\n\nIn boiling, the water molecules are also held together by strong bonds. Heat from the boiling water causes the bonds", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Our skin is composed of two main layers: the epidermis, which is the outer layer that protects our skin, and the dermis, which is the deeper layer. The dermis is responsible for giving our skin its strength and elasticity. When we get wet, our skin absorbs the water and expands, and the dermis stretches to accommodate for the increased volume. The dermis has a very low concentration of collagen fibers, and when it stretches, these fibers get damaged. This damage is repaired by the body, but the collagen fibers never", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The Apollo astronauts left equipment on the Moon in the form of scientific instruments, a variety of rock and soil samples, and a television camera.
