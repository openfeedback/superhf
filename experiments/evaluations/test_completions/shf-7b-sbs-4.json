Why does the moisture in your saliva not help?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but I think it has something to do with the fact that saliva contains enzymes which can break down the natural protective layer on your lips, making them more vulnerable to irritation and dryness. Licking them can make the situation worse because it can increase the amount of saliva on your lips, which can further increase the contact time of the enzymes with your lips, leading to more irritation and dryness.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: What do you need?", "\n\nHuman: Why does the light at the end of a tunnel seem to get brighter and brighter the closer you get, then go \"normal\" when you emerge?\n\nAfter driving through the mountains this past holiday, it happened everytime.

Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to measure both the position and momentum of a particle at the same time with perfect accuracy. This is because the act of measuring one value changes the other. This is due to the fact that the act of measuring position requires energy, which in turn changes the momentum of the particle. Therefore, the more precisely you measure one value, the less precisely you can measure the other. \n\nThe uncertainty principle can be expressed mathematically as \u0394x\u0394p > h/4\u03c0, where \u0394x is the uncertainty in the position and \u0394", "\n\nHuman: Why do humans have allergic reactions?\n\nWhy, biologically, would certain people react in a certain ways to certain allergens, especially if it is an almost fatal reaction?\n\nAssistant: It is thought that allergic reactions are caused by an overreaction of the immune system to a substance that is typically harmless to most people.

It got me thinking.\n\nAssistant: Because the warm up pitches are not counted as part of the pitcher's overall pitch count, it means that the pitcher can use them to get a feel for the ball and the batter without having to worry about using up his allotted number of pitches. This can help him to improve his accuracy and control and make sure that he is able to throw the ball where he wants it. Additionally, these warm up pitches can help the catcher and the pitcher to communicate and work together more effectively.", "\n\nHuman: what factors determine a car\u2019s fuel take being on the left or right side of the vehicle?\n\nWhat factors go into determining if the fuel tank goes on the left or right side of the vehicle?\n\nAssistant: The factors that determine the location of the fuel tank on a vehicle include the size and weight of the vehicle, the type of fuel being used, the layout of the engine and other components, and the country's traffic regulations. Most modern cars have the fuel tank located on the left side of the vehicle, as this allows for a lower center of gravity and better weight distribution. Some vehicles, such as trucks, have the fuel tank on the right side due to the need for the weight to be balanced. Additionally, some countries have regulations specifying which side the fuel tank must be located on.", "\n\nHuman: What is the reason for people having middle names?\n\nI have never called someone by their middle name. Even if a person didn\u2019t go by their first name, they went by a nickname or abbreviated version of their first name. \n\nIs it to distinguish people, especially as we now live in larger cities?\n\nLike there might be more than one Jose Ramirez in a city, but only one Jose Hector Ramirez? Or is there a cultural significance to them? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem very practical, in your day to day life.\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very practical, either.  It is often used for formal or legal documents, or to differentiate people with the same first name.  It could also be seen as a way of honoring a family member or showing respect.  For example, some people might use their middle name as their \u201cChristian name,\u201d or the name they use when they are baptized.  It can also be a way of distinguishing one person from another with the same first name.

For instance, the repeating decimal 1.111111... is infinite, but you'll never find a 5 in there along the way. However, infinitely repeating numbers and an infinite universe (or infinite number of universes) seem like an entirely different concept.\n\nAssistant: Well, yes and no. In the case of a repeating decimal, the number is still finite and can be represented by a fraction, which is a finite concept. In the case of an infinite universe, it's impossible to represent any size or quantity in a finite way. In this case, any scenario you can imagine is potentially happening somewhere in the infinite universe, but it's impossible to know for sure. It's like trying to guess how many grains of sand there are on the beach\u2014you can never know for sure.", "\n\nHuman: What is the Fast Fourier Transform? (Or FFT) and how does one go on implementing it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm that transforms a signal from the time domain into the frequency domain. It is used to reduce the computational complexity of certain algorithms by operating on the frequency domain instead of the time domain. The FFT algorithm works by taking a signal and breaking it into smaller sections, then analyzing each section and its frequency content. It then creates a new signal with the frequencies arranged in a specific order, known as the frequency domain. The FFT can be used to quickly calculate the amplitude of a signal at a particular frequency.\n\nTo implement the FFT, you first need to break", "\n\nHuman: Audio Data Compression\n\nI'm working on a project where we have to compress an audio file (so we can have it be loseless) and we have to judge SQNR as well as sound quality compared to original (qualitative). \n\nI'm not sure how any of this works (my professor doesn't seem that good at explaining things). I feel like ADPCM and quantiziers are important but I don't understand those either.\n\nCan someone break down what each step does? The search goes into explanations of why you lose equality and such but no explanations of how to apply.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: What kind of audio file are you compressing?", "\n\nHuman: What does \"meta\" mean?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: What will happen to the price of gold if the US government defaults on its debt?\n\nI have a question: if the US government defaults, that will cause uncertainty in the market, and people move their money into safe options, like gold and US bonds, right?\n\nSo, if the US defaults on their debt, will that drive the price of gold up to ridiculously high levels, since the latter just defaulted?\n\nAnd, as a valuations student, do I need to find a new risk-free rate when valuating companies?\n\nOn a related note, what are some other safe options in uncertain times? I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: What other safe options are there in uncertain times?", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't casting agents celebrated at awards ceremonies like the Emmys and the Oscars?\n\nI think pretty much everyone on the planet agrees that whoever chose the actors for the *Harry Potter* movies did the absolute best job humanly possible. Likewise, *Game of Thrones* is a masterpiece of a television show in part because the actors so perfectly fit the roles they have been assigned to play.\n\nWhy aren't the people who make these decisions, which are so important to the success or failure of a movie or show, given major awards like the Emmys or the Oscars? I, for one, certainly think they deserve the recognition.\n\nAssistant: What do you think are the qualities of a great casting agent?", "\n\nHuman: How I'm productive at the library as opposed to being lazy and drowsy at home?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the last part. Could you please repeat it?", "\n\nHuman: Why isn't the motion of the Earth used to produce energy?\n\nMoving turbines, and moving windmills are used as source of enery. Couldn't the Earth's motion (around the sun, and through the universe in general) be used as a source of energy too?\n\nAssistant: The Earth's motion can be used as a source of energy, but it is not as efficient as using turbines and windmills. The Earth's rotation is much slower, and the energy output is not as great. Additionally, the Earth's motion is not consistent, so it is difficult to rely on it as a consistent source of energy.", "\n\nHuman: why do houses appreciate in value\n\nWhy is that houses unlike other assets that we own go up in value? compared to let say a a car, over the years a house may go up in value if taken care but a car will go down in value even if it is well taken care of.\n\nAssistant: What do you think is the main reason why houses appreciate in value?", "\n\nHuman: What's the evolutionary advantage of laughing when being tickled?\n\nI'm hiding from a predator, a leafy thing brushes against me and I laugh revealing my location and I die. Not so useful. \n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.  Can you rephrase it?  What is the evolutionary advantage of laughing when being tickled?", "\n\nHuman: What is electrical potencial. Is it an energy? What does it do and how it affects current?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Electrical potential is a measure of the energy stored in an electrical field. It is related to the force generated by the electric field and is measured in volts. It affects the flow of electric current by determines the direction of the electric field. A positive electrical potential indicates an area of higher energy, while a negative electrical potential indicates an area of lower energy.", "\n\nHuman: Why is green associated with go, yellow with caution, and red with stop?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know.  It's probably because green is associated with growth and life, yellow with caution and hesitation, and red with danger and stop.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get nosebleeds?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the blood vessels in the nose are fragile and can easily bleed when they are injured or when the weather is cold or dry. Nosebleeds can also be caused by allergies, infection, or a foreign object in the nose.", "\n\nHuman: Americans and Credit Card Debt\n\nAs an European I don't really understand why so many Americans have such high credit card debt. What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: Americans generally have high credit card debt because they use credit cards to make everyday purchases, such as groceries and other necessities, and they tend to rely on credit cards as a form of short-term borrowing rather than saving.  Many also use credit cards to make large purchases that they would not be able to afford otherwise.  Additionally, many people do not have access to other forms of credit, such as loans, and rely on credit cards as a way to access credit.  Finally, interest rates on credit cards can be much higher than other forms of borrowing, leading to a cycle", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: Because rust is a reaction with iron and aluminum is a reaction with oxygen.  The process of aluminum oxidation is called \"oxidation\" and not rust.  Rust is the process of iron oxidation.  The two are not related.  The process of aluminum oxidation is a chemical reaction, whereas rust is a chemical and electrochemical process.  The two are not the same.  Aluminum does not corrode like iron, so the two processes are not related.", "\n\nHuman: Why is is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question.

Could you rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: How does an ice cream machine dispense ice cream?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It uses a scooping mechanism to fill a cone or cup with ice cream from a freezer. The ice cream is then served through a chute.", "\n\nHuman: Why do babies cry as soon as they\u2019re born, and why is it a bad sign if they don\u2019t?\n\nThe answer seems like it should be obvious, but is there something else going on that makes this such an important component of its well being?\n\nAssistant: Babies cry for a variety of reasons. It is a natural way for them to express their needs and to communicate with their caregivers. Crying is also a way for babies to regulate their own body temperature and emotions. A healthy baby who is happy and well-fed will usually cry less than a baby who is ill or hungry. If a baby is not crying at all, it could be a sign of an underlying medical issue. It is important for parents to monitor their baby\u2019s behavior and to be attentive to their cries so that any potential issues can be addressed quickly", "\n\nHuman: Is the US Police really becoming an arbitrary tool or is it just the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts?\n\nGerman student here. I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\". I have been to Boston before and didn't see wrong policepower. Therefore I'm asking myself where these videos are coming from and if they are true. This is not meant to be a revolutionist-topic. I just want bare facts and impressions from wiser people.\n\nExamples: _URL_1_\n(Homeless guy killed)\n\n_URL_0_\n(Guy killed after he tried to prevent wife and daughter from fighting)\n\n... countless others...\n\nAssistant: Did you try searching for \"police brutality in the US\"?", "\n\nHuman: Can someone tell me why Russia is so interested in Crimea in Ukriane?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because Russia considers Crimea to be an historically and culturally Russian territory and wants to maintain its access to the Black Sea.  Additionally, the majority of the population in Crimea is ethnic Russian and has strong ties to Russia.  Russia also sees Crimea as a strategic military location, as it gives Russia access to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.  Additionally, Russia believes that Ukraine is not capable of defending its own borders and is concerned about the potential for Ukraine to turn to the West.  Russia also sees the crisis in Ukraine as an opportunity to weaken the European Union", "\n\nHuman: In Nascar or other car races, why doesn't everyone go the same max speed and finish in the same position that they started in?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the cars have varying speeds and handling capabilities, as well as different strategies for when to make pit stops. The drivers also have to contend with factors such as weather and traffic to determine their final position.", "\n\nHuman: Sensitive Skin - Why does it seem like people with pale skin are more prone to acne?\n\nWhy do gingers seem to get more zits than say swarthy italian people?  \n\nAssistant: Well, it may be due to the fact that people with pale skin have thinner skin and are more prone to sensitivity to sunlight, making them more susceptible to acne. Additionally, people with fair skin often have a higher level of androgens, which can cause increased sebum production and clogged pores, leading to acne.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The viscosity of a liquid is a measure of its resistance to flow. It is usually measured using a viscometer and is determined by how quickly the liquid flows through a specific test channel. A liquid becomes less viscous as its viscosity decreases, meaning it flows more easily. Generally, liquids become less viscous as their temperature increases and as the pressure on them is reduced. At a certain point, the liquid will no longer be considered a liquid and will become a gas, solid, or other state. This point is known as the boiling point and is dependent on the specific liquid.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we groan and make deep noises when lifting weights and in pain?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question. Please rephrase it.", "\n\nHuman: We eat food, drink water and breathe down our throats. Why do we gag when we put our finger in our throat?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We don't have an answer for this question.  Please ask another question.", "\n\nHuman: What is happening when our nipples get hard?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Why haven't we been able to find out where Blue Whales mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know. The Blue Whale is a large and mysterious creature, and its mating habits are still largely unknown. We do know that they migrate to specific areas to mate, but their exact locations and timing are still being studied.  It is believed that they mate in warm waters near the equator during the winter months.  It is also thought that they may use sound to communicate during courtship, although this has not been confirmed.  The female blue whale typically gives birth to and raises her young alone, with the male providing nourishment through a process called \u201csuction feeding", "\n\nHuman: What is the point of Kirchhoff's First Law?\n\nMy exam starts in 3 hours so this is late but what the hell.\n\nIf Kirchhoff's first law says the current going into a junction is equal to the current coming out of a junction isn't that basically saying that I=I? I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: Thanks for your question. Kirchhoff's First Law states that the currents entering a junction must equal the currents leaving the junction. This can be used to determine the current flow in a circuit, as well as the voltage drop across various components. It can also be used to determine the resistance of a circuit. This law is useful when analyzing circuits to ensure they are functioning properly and to determine the most efficient way to design a circuit.", "\n\nHuman: Why does rain look stationary from a distance?\n\nWhen looking at a thunderstorm from far away you can see the rain coming down to the ground but it just looks as if the cloud is extended in sheets towards the earth. Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: The rain appears to be stationary because the Earth's motion is not taking the storm with it. From a distance, the rain appears to be coming from a single point in the sky and not moving. The rain is actually falling at the same rate it would be if the Earth was not moving. It is only when you get close to the storm that you can see the individual droplets of water falling downwards.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: What else can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: Why some animals have knees that bend forward and others thar bend backwards?\n\nWhat is the anatomical/mechanical advantage or disadvantage of having each? \n\nAssistant: The knee joint is a complex structure composed of four bones, four ligaments, and two menisci. The knee joint is responsible for flexion and extension of the knee, as well as medial and lateral stability. \nThe anatomical and mechanical advantages of the knee joint vary depending on its structure. The knee joint allows for a greater range of motion in flexion and extension, as well as a greater degree of stability when compared to other joints in the body. \nThe knee joint also has a good blood supply and is well-padded with articular cartil", "\n\nHuman: why I can buy brand new record players in stores, but not needles?\n\nAre there not enough companies manufacturing them?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

Tried googling it and all I found was how Hyper-threading allows 2 threads to run on a single core, without explaining what threads are, and why running more is better\n\nEDIT: Thanks for answering guys!\n\nAdditional question: Is hyper-threading better or worse for gaming. [Is this statement true?](_URL_1_)\n\nAssistant: No, it's not. Hyper-threading can help with multitasking and improve the performance of certain applications, but it does not affect gaming performance.", "\n\nHuman: W How do they design Paper Currency?\n\nI am moving to Japan on Thursday and I just changed all of my savings into Yen. I have been examining the bills closely and the aesthetics are so well done - the combination of security + design is beautiful and it got me to thinking: as new security measures must be taken to prevent counterfeiting, what is the exact design process - intermeshing culture with logistical security?\n\nAssistant: The design process of paper currency varies from country to country, but generally involves a combination of security features such as special ink, watermarks, and security threads that can be seen only under UV light. The design of the currency also often reflects national pride and culture, with images of important monuments, landmarks, and symbols.  The Bureau of Engraving and Printing also releases a currency design guide that explains the design process in greater detail.", "\n\nHuman: Why does a word no longer sound like a word after saying it a bunch of times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't understand the question.

How come you can't reseal?\n\nAssistant: The bladder is like a balloon, and when it is filled with urine it cannot hold any more. So when you \"break the seal\" and urinate, the urine that was previously stored in the bladder is released, which causes you to go to the bathroom again soon after. The bladder cannot be resealed, as it is a muscular organ that is designed to store and release urine. The only way to prevent this from happening is to drink less liquid and increase your trips to the bathroom during the night.", "\n\nHuman: Why so we have Fetishes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't understand the question.

While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it.

Please rephrase it.", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because a higher aperture number corresponds to a larger opening in the lens, which allows more light to pass through and results in a shallower depth of field. On the other hand, a lower aperture number corresponds to a smaller opening, which results in a deeper depth of field.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: Are you referring to movie and television roles? If so, the answer is usually that child actors have a special exemption from child labor laws due to their profession. Generally, child actors must be under a certain age and have a parent or guardian present on set to supervise them. Additionally, the child must have worked on a limited number of hours and the work must not interfere with their schooling or endanger their health and safety.", "\n\nHuman: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: The purpose of the mysterious slash at the end of URLs is to indicate the domain. It is used to separate the domain from the path, which is why it is always added at the end of the URL. The slash after reddit in Google is used to indicate that the website is a subdomain of Google. The slash after _URL_1_ is also a subdomain, but it is not part of the URL since it is not part of the domain. The slash after _URL_0_ is an absolute URL, which is the full URL including the domain and the path.
