This is a bit tricky, because it is not as simple as it seems.  Let me try to explain.\n\nSuppose we have a particle with a certain position and momentum.  We want to measure these two quantities.

The object's internal state determines its performance, and its current performance depends on its internal state. For example, an object might have an internal state that determines its temperature. Changing the object's internal state (e.g., heating it) changes its temperature.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar isn't inherently bad for you, but it is not a nutrient.  It does contain calories, but so does fat.  The body does need sugar for energy.\n\nHowever, the calories in sugar do not come with any other nutrients, so if you eat a lot of sugar, you are missing out on nutrients.
