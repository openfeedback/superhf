As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: I will explain it in detail.\n\nEggs are surrounded by a membrane which contains albumin, a protein which is responsible for the egg white and the shell. When an egg is boiled, the heat causes the albumin to denature and form cross-links between the proteins. This causes the egg white to thicken and harden and the egg shell to become tough.\n\nPasta is made from flour. When the pasta is boiled in water, the starch in the flour is converted to glucose. This is why pasta softens when it is boiled", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, but I don't understand.

The nerves and muscles are connected to the brain. When the nerves and muscles are stimulated, they cause the eyelids to close and then open. When the eyelids close, the eyes are covered and protected from light and dust. When the eyes are covered, the eyes feel comfortable and the person feels relaxed. When the eyelids open, the eyes are exposed to light and fresh air. This process allows the eyes to get rid of dust and dirt that may", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price.

It's a great question, and I'll give you a very basic overview of how the body processes sugar.  Hopefully, this will help you understand why sugar is \"bad\" for you.\n\nSugar is a simple carbohydrate, which means it is easily broken down by the body.  It is made up of one molecule of glucose.

If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Time is relative. The rate at which you experience time is relative to your location in the universe.

First, I think that there is a difference in the average libido between men and women.  The average man has a higher libido than the average woman.

Second, I think that men are more likely to have casual sex with a stranger than women.  This is partly because men are more likely to be promiscuous than women.", "\n\nHuman: We have vitamin A , B, C, D, E and K but not F, G, H, I and J.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver has two functions that are very important to the digestive system. It makes bile, which helps digest fats, and it makes blood. When you eat, the liver has to make more blood because your blood volume increases and your blood has to flow faster to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the cells. The liver also has to make more bile, because bile helps digest fats. Bile is stored in the gallbladder, which releases bile into the small intestine. Bile breaks down fats so that they can be absorbed into the body", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high pitch ringing noise is called a sine wave.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries run out of power because they are used up.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: You are talking about water escaping from the cabbage when it is cooked. When vegetables are cut, they release some water. This is because the cells of the vegetable release water, and the more you cut the vegetable the more water it releases. If you add salt, the cells release more water because the salt draws water out of the cells. The water is released through the cut surface, which is why it appears to be escaping from the cut surface.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you put your hands in water for a long time, the water molecules enter your body, and the water molecules enter your body, and the water molecules enter your body, and the water molecules enter your body, and the water molecules enter your body, and the water molecules enter your body, and the water molecules enter your body, and the water molecules enter your body, and the water molecules enter your body, and the water molecules enter your body, and the water molecules enter your body, and the water molecules enter your body, and the water molecules enter your body,", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The Moon is a reflector of light.
