Sometimes to the point of it making me nearly blind until I got out of the tunnel. Even though it wasn't super bright out to begin with. \n\nAssistant: No idea.", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact momentum and position of a particle with absolute certainty. This is because the more precisely you measure the momentum of a particle, the less precisely you can measure its position, and vice versa. This is due to the fact that the act of measuring one value changes the other.  In other words, the more precisely you measure one value, the more imprecise your measurement of the other value will be, and vice versa. This is known as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.", "\n\nHuman: Why do humans have allergic reactions?\n\nWhy, biologically, would certain people react in a certain ways to certain allergens, especially if it is an almost fatal reaction?\n\nAssistant: That is an interesting question. We don't know for sure, but we do know that allergies are the result of an overreaction of the body's immune system to a particular allergen. It is believed that this overreaction is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is also possible that certain people are more likely to develop allergies due to their genetic makeup, making them more sensitive to the allergens around them.", "\n\nHuman: What is the best way to learn a new language?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many ways to learn a new language.

This DC electricity is then converted into AC electricity, which is used in homes and businesses.", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the music industry implement a Steam-like pricing system?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they want to maximize their profits by charging whatever the market will bear.", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What type of TV do you have?", "\n\nHuman: Why did purple became a 'dangerous' colour? (Like potraying poison)\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: Because of its association with royalty and the nobility, purple became a colour of power and status. In many cultures, it was seen as a symbol of authority and wealth. As a result, it was often used to indicate danger or warning. For example, in ancient Rome, a purple rope was used to demarcate a boundary between the common people and the emperor, and anyone who crossed it was subject to severe punishment. In the middle ages, purple was also associated with the occult and the supernatural, making it a symbol of fear and mystery.", "\n\nHuman: In baseball, why does the pitcher's warm up pitches not contribute to his overall pitch count?\n\nI was watching the game last night and noticed that not only do they throw warm up pitches (pretty fast ones too) before the game but also between innings. It got me thinking.\n\nAssistant: Those are not considered part of the pitcher's overall pitch count, as they are not part of the actual game.", "\n\nHuman: what factors determine a car\u2019s fuel take being on the left or right side of the vehicle?\n\nWhat factors go into determining if the fuel tank goes on the left or right side of the vehicle?\n\nAssistant: The factors that determine the location of a car's fuel tank include engine placement, vehicle design, safety considerations, and local regulations. Generally, cars with rear-mounted engines have their fuel tank on the left side, while cars with front-mounted engines have their fuel tank on the right side. Vehicle design, such as the size and shape of the car, also affects the placement of the fuel tank. Safety considerations, such as minimizing the risk of fuel leakage in the event of a crash, can also influence the positioning of the fuel tank. Finally, local", "\n\nHuman: What is the reason for people having middle names?\n\nI have never called someone by their middle name. Even if a person didn\u2019t go by their first name, they went by a nickname or abbreviated version of their first name. \n\nIs it to distinguish people, especially as we now live in larger cities?\n\nLike there might be more than one Jose Ramirez in a city, but only one Jose Hector Ramirez? Or is there a cultural significance to them? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem very practical, in your day to day life.\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure if there is a practical reason, but it is a cultural tradition in some countries to give people middle names. In some cases, it can be a way of honoring someone or something, such as a family member or a location. It can also be a way of differentiating people with the same name.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: What makes the palms of our hands different than other areas of our skin?\n\nThe palms of our hands have more sweat glands, more sensory nerve endings, and fewer protective oils than other areas of the skin. Additionally, the skin on the palms of our hands is thinner and more delicate than other areas. This makes them more vulnerable to irritants, such as chemicals and contact dermatitis. It also means that they may be more likely to develop eczema or other skin conditions.", "\n\nHuman: How can human smugglers illegally ship migrants to a different country?

Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a period of inactivity and metabolic depression in animals and other organisms, in which the body burns stored fats and muscle tissue for energy and body temperature is lowered in order to conserve energy. It is different from sleep in that it is a state of inactivity and metabolic depression, while sleep is a state of rest and relaxation. Hibernating animals typically sleep in the same position, but they may move slightly if they are disturbed. They recover quickly because they use up less energy in hibernation than they would in activity, and their body temperature", "\n\nHuman: Does Listening to An Audiobook Affect the Brain the Same Way Reading a Book Would?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between an audiobook and a podcast?", "\n\nHuman: how do we know the taste of highly poisonous substances? Or do we have no idea about it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We can determine the taste of highly poisonous substances through experimentation and observation. Some substances, like cyanide, are so toxic that even a small amount can cause an unpleasant taste, while other substances require much more to cause a taste response.", "\n\nHuman: We have vitamin A , B, C, D, E and K but not F, G, H, I and J.

Is there any conjecture that there was a common source of this idea?  Or (I assume) it was just advantageous for the chieftains to perpetuate?\n\nAssistant: Well, there is evidence that certain religious groups have long held the belief that dying in battle could lead to a better afterlife, but it's hard to say for sure where this idea originated.", "\n\nHuman: Why does Steam always have to install Microsoft C++ Redistributable 2005 when I install a game?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What kind of game are you installing?", "\n\nHuman: What does the term \"too big to fail\" mean?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It means that an institution or organization is considered to be of vital importance to the economy or society, and so it cannot be allowed to fail. It is usually applied to financial institutions, such as banks, which are considered too important to the economy to be allowed to collapse.", "\n\nHuman: what are laser beams  &  how are they different from light beams?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?", "\n\nHuman: Why do headphones sometimes sound better after being used a bit?\n\nBefore I bought my current headphones, I found that reviewers would say that certain headphones did or did not require a \"burning-in\" time or something like that. Why is that, and why do some need it and some others don't?\n\nAssistant: The \"burning-in\" process is a way to reduce the resonances of the headphones and make the sound more natural. It's a way of equalizing the sound over time, so that the sound is more balanced and consistent. It's common for headphones to sound better after a burning-in period, since the resonances and sound characteristics are more in balance.", "\n\nHuman: What social factors caused Austin, a liberal hipster enclave, to develop in the middle of a highly conservative state?\n\nIt's something I've thought about fairly often lately. The idea of the 'blueberry in the tomato soup' is a bit hard to understand when you really get down to it. I love sociology and I've got some ideas of how this could have developed, but I'm still learning and I haven't managed to piece this one together on my own so far.\n\nAssistant: What do you know about the history of Austin?\n\nI know that it was settled in the late 1800s as a small farming community, and it slowly began to grow and develop into a college town with the founding of the University of Texas in 1883. It became the capital of Texas in 1885, and has since developed into a vibrant and diverse city.

Doenst that hurt their international market?\n\nLays- Walkers\n\nWalls-Frigo-Ola\n\nAssistant: Well, it depends on the brand. Some brands change their names to make them sound more appealing to the local market, while others do it to make it easier for customers to remember. For example, Walkers in the UK are known as Lays in other countries. In some cases, it can also be a way for companies to take advantage of regional or cultural references. For example, in Mexico, Frigo-Ola is a popular brand of frozen foods.", "\n\nHuman: What are those white tabs on football helmets that players pull outwards whenever they're done with a drive?\n\nThey're just two white tabs on the sides of the football helmet that the players pull to release them.  I'm guessing they help hold the helmet, but please, ELI5?\n\nAssistant: Are those white tabs on football helmets that players pull outwards whenever they're done with a drive?\n\nYes, they are.  They are called \"chin straps\" and they are designed to help hold the helmet in place.  They are usually made of a stretchy material and are attached to the sides of the helmet.  When the player is done with a drive, they can pull on the chin straps to release the helmet from their head.", "\n\nHuman: How does the world keep track of time and who decides, or how do we know what the time is in terms of smallest negative powers of second?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The world keeps track of time using atomic clocks, which are very precise instruments that use the vibrations of atoms to measure time. These atomic clocks are set to a global time standard called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). UTC is the same everywhere in the world, and it is the same as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

Gluons are the particles that mediate the strong nuclear force, the force that binds quarks together in atomic nuclei and in atomic nuclei themselves. Gluons are massless particles, meaning they have no mass and do not interact strongly with other matter. Gluons are responsible for the color charge of quarks, which is why two quarks of the same color will attract each other strongly and form a bound state, while quarks of different colors will repel", "\n\nHuman: What exactly a \"deductible\" is when it comes to health insurance.\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is a deductible?", "\n\nHuman: Theoretically, if the universe does turn out to be infinite (or there are an infinite number of universes), does that mean any scenario I can possibly imagine is actually happening somewhere right now?\n\nFathoming probability when it comes to infinity is something I can't really wrap my mind around. For instance, the repeating decimal 1.111111... is infinite, but you'll never find a 5 in there along the way. However, infinitely repeating numbers and an infinite universe (or infinite number of universes) seem like an entirely different concept.\n\nAssistant: The universe is infinite, so it is possible that any scenario you can imagine is happening somewhere in an infinite number of universes.", "\n\nHuman: What is the Fast Fourier Transform? (Or FFT) and how does one go on implementing it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a mathematical algorithm used to convert a signal or data from one domain to another.

For example, a web page may have a meta description that describes the page's content.", "\n\nHuman: What will happen to the price of gold if the US government defaults on its debt?\n\nI have a question: if the US government defaults, that will cause uncertainty in the market, and people move their money into safe options, like gold and US bonds, right?\n\nSo, if the US defaults on their debt, will that drive the price of gold up to ridiculously high levels, since the latter just defaulted?\n\nAnd, as a valuations student, do I need to find a new risk-free rate when valuating companies?\n\nOn a related note, what are some other safe options in uncertain times? I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: What is the risk-free rate?", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't casting agents celebrated at awards ceremonies like the Emmys and the Oscars?\n\nI think pretty much everyone on the planet agrees that whoever chose the actors for the *Harry Potter* movies did the absolute best job humanly possible. Likewise, *Game of Thrones* is a masterpiece of a television show in part because the actors so perfectly fit the roles they have been assigned to play.\n\nWhy aren't the people who make these decisions, which are so important to the success or failure of a movie or show, given major awards like the Emmys or the Oscars? I, for one, certainly think they deserve the recognition.\n\nAssistant: What would you like me to do next?", "\n\nHuman: How I'm productive at the library as opposed to being lazy and drowsy at home?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What are the distractions at the library?\n\n[removed]", "\n\nHuman: Why isn't the motion of the Earth used to produce energy?\n\nMoving turbines, and moving windmills are used as source of enery. Couldn't the Earth's motion (around the sun, and through the universe in general) be used as a source of energy too?\n\nAssistant: The Earth's motion is used to produce energy, in the form of gravitational potential energy. This potential energy is converted into kinetic energy through the process of tidal energy, which is then used to generate electricity. Additionally, the Earth's rotation is used to generate kinetic energy, which is then converted into electrical energy through the use of wind turbines.", "\n\nHuman: why do houses appreciate in value\n\nWhy is that houses unlike other assets that we own go up in value? compared to let say a a car, over the years a house may go up in value if taken care but a car will go down in value even if it is well taken care of.\n\nAssistant: The appreciation of a house is usually due to the demand for housing in a given area and the availability of housing stock. When demand for housing is high and the supply is low, prices will tend to increase. Additionally, improvements to the property, such as renovations or additions, can also increase its value.", "\n\nHuman: What's the evolutionary advantage of laughing when being tickled?\n\nI'm hiding from a predator, a leafy thing brushes against me and I laugh revealing my location and I die.

I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\". I have been to Boston before and didn't see wrong policepower. Therefore I'm asking myself where these videos are coming from and if they are true. This is not meant to be a revolutionist-topic. I just want bare facts and impressions from wiser people.\n\nExamples: _URL_1_\n(Homeless guy killed)\n\n_URL_0_\n(Guy killed after he tried to prevent wife and daughter from fighting)\n\n... countless others...\n\nAssistant: Are there any other questions?", "\n\nHuman: Can someone tell me why Russia is so interested in Crimea in Ukriane?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Russia has a long-standing naval base in Crimea and a large ethnic Russian population in the region. It also seeks to maintain influence in the area as part of its wider policy of expanding its influence in the Black Sea region.", "\n\nHuman: In Nascar or other car races, why doesn't everyone go the same max speed and finish in the same position that they started in?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, the cars are not all the same, and the drivers have different skills and strategies. Some cars are faster than others and some drivers are better at maneuvering their cars. Additionally, the track conditions and weather can also affect the outcome of the race.", "\n\nHuman: Sensitive Skin - Why does it seem like people with pale skin are more prone to acne?\n\nWhy do gingers seem to get more zits than say swarthy italian people?  \n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the boiling point of water?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we groan and make deep noises when lifting weights and in pain?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is a reflex action to express discomfort or pain.", "\n\nHuman: We eat food, drink water and breathe down our throats. Why do we gag when we put our finger in our throat?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We don't have an answer to that.", "\n\nHuman: What is happening when our nipples get hard?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Our nipples become hard when our body temperature rises or when we are aroused. It is an evolutionary adaptation that helps us to keep warm and to attract a mate.", "\n\nHuman: Why haven't we been able to find out where Blue Whales mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they mate in deep, remote ocean regions which are difficult to access.", "\n\nHuman: What is the point of Kirchhoff's First Law?\n\nMy exam starts in 3 hours so this is late but what the hell.\n\nIf Kirchhoff's first law says the current going into a junction is equal to the current coming out of a junction isn't that basically saying that I=I? I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: You'll have to explain a bit more about what you're trying to do. What is the context? What is the problem?", "\n\nHuman: Why does rain look stationary from a distance?\n\nWhen looking at a thunderstorm from far away you can see the rain coming down to the ground but it just looks as if the cloud is extended in sheets towards the earth. Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: Because from a distance, the rain appears to be falling horizontally, parallel to the ground. This is an illusion caused by the way our brains interpret the visual cues from the environment.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: What else can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: Why some animals have knees that bend forward and others thar bend backwards?\n\nWhat is the anatomical/mechanical advantage or disadvantage of having each? \n\nAssistant: Bending forward allows for better stability when walking or running on uneven terrain. Bending backwards allows for greater flexibility when moving in tight spaces or reaching for objects.", "\n\nHuman: why I can buy brand new record players in stores, but not needles?\n\nAre there not enough companies manufacturing them?\n\nAssistant: Well, I'm not sure why exactly, but it could be because the demand for needles isn't as high as it is for record players.", "\n\nHuman: Why airplanes only record audio during flights and not video? Wouldn\u2019t video be more valuable for the NTSB in case something bad happens?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a great question. The answer is that airplanes are typically equipped with audio recorders, but not video recorders. This is because the sound of a plane's engines is much louder than the sound of the environment, so the audio recorder is able to pick up sound more accurately than a video recorder. Additionally, the vibrations from the video recorder would cause the plane to be unsafe to fly.", "\n\nHuman: Radioactivity. Some analogy would be very helpful\n\n\n\nAssistant: Can you give me an example of how radioactivity works?", "\n\nHuman: regarding the latest net neutrality ruling, is it possible it is a good thing because it will push google to role out google fiber in more areas? Are there any upsides for consumers on that ruling?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a great question! The FCC's net neutrality ruling could benefit consumers by allowing them to access more content without having to worry about internet service providers (ISPs) charging them extra. Additionally, it could lead to more competition in the industry, which could lead to better quality services and lower prices for consumers. It could also lead to the development of more innovative services and products, as ISPs are no longer able to block or throttle user's access to certain services.", "\n\nHuman: What are you thinking before developing language ?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm thinking about what features would be useful for the language development system.", "\n\nHuman: When and how did banks switch from actual paper money to the computerized system they use today?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?", "\n\nHuman: Why are there diseases/viruses/etc that harm the human body, but never anything that enhances or improves us?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the human body is designed to be self-sustaining and maintaining a balance within the body, any foreign substance that enters it can potentially disrupt this balance and cause harm. Over time, the body can build up defenses against certain viruses and diseases, but new ones can always emerge.", "\n\nHuman: Why is a cup the prize the team/individual gets when they win something instead of the subject related item. (In most cases.)\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the prize for winning a game?", "\n\nHuman: difference between iPhone jailbreaking and Android rooting\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between jailbreaking an iPhone and rooting an Android device?", "\n\nHuman: CPU Hyper-threading and Threads\n\n[In this video](_URL_0_), the guy talks about how i7s aren't better than i5s just because of the hyper-threading, and he shows the performance benchmarks\n\nWhat really is Hyper-threading? Tried googling it and all I found was how Hyper-threading allows 2 threads to run on a single core, without explaining what threads are, and why running more is better\n\nEDIT: Thanks for answering guys!\n\nAdditional question: Is hyper-threading better or worse for gaming. [Is this statement true?](_URL_1_)\n\nAssistant: Is this statement true?\nHyper-threading is better for gaming.", "\n\nHuman: W How do they design Paper Currency?\n\nI am moving to Japan on Thursday and I just changed all of my savings into Yen. I have been examining the bills closely and the aesthetics are so well done - the combination of security + design is beautiful and it got me to thinking: as new security measures must be taken to prevent counterfeiting, what is the exact design process - intermeshing culture with logistical security?\n\nAssistant: What exactly do you mean by 'design process'?", "\n\nHuman: Why does a word no longer sound like a word after saying it a bunch of times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: What happens when you \"break the seal\" while you have been drinking?\n\nBasically, why does this cause you to go pee every 20 minutes after you go pee the first time? How come you can't reseal?\n\nAssistant: When you break the seal, your body responds by releasing more urine to try and return the levels of water and salts in your body to normal. This can cause you to need to pee more frequently. The seal cannot be resealed, because it is the body's natural response to dehydration.", "\n\nHuman: Why so we have Fetishes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they help us to find someone special and to remember them. They can be an object, a place, an animal or even a person. They are a way of making a connection with someone and to feel close to them even when we are apart.", "\n\nHuman: The British National Front\n\nWhat are their ideologies and goals? What kind of people are a part of NF? Have there been any important court cases or something like that involving the NF?\n\nAssistant: The British National Front (BF) is a far-right political party in the United Kingdom. They seek to promote British nationalism and a white-only homeland for the British people. They are strongly opposed to immigration, multiculturalism, and other minority rights. The BNF is largely considered a hate group and has been involved in many violent incidents and criminal activities. In recent years, the BNF has experienced a sharp decline in membership and support.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Taco Bell chicken brown in Canada, but white in America?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I can't understand your question. Can you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: How does a Skype call continue to function even when the program itself stops responding?\n\nTried searching for this answer. Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: How does a Skype call continue to function even when the program itself stops responding?", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because a higher aperture number corresponds to a smaller opening in the lens, which allows less light to pass through, resulting in a shallower depth of field. Conversely, a lower aperture number corresponds to a larger opening, which allows more light to pass through and results in a greater depth of field.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: What type of work are we talking about?", "\n\nHuman: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The medicines become ineffective or even harmful beyond their expiry date as they may contain chemicals or bacteria that can cause illness.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the food is spicy and stimulates the digestive system.", "\n\nHuman: why do giraffes have horns?\n\nI was just wondering...\nEdit: thanks for all the responses you guys even the bad ones :D And no I don't think that giraffes have ended their evolution process, your reading into it to much.\n\nAssistant: Giraffes have horns for defense against predators. They also use them to communicate with other giraffes, by using their horns to touch other giraffes in the herd and then sniffing each other's scent.", "\n\nHuman: Can you change the temperature of a subject with sound alone?\n\nTo clarify I don't mean temperature produced by whatever produces the sound. I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure if that's possible. It might be possible to increase the temperature of a liquid by using sound waves, but I'm not sure how much of an effect it would have. It might be worth looking into further research into the topic.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the ink is dry. The ink needs to be moist in order to write on paper. If the ink is dry, it won't come out. Try wetting the tip of the pen with your tongue or by dipping it in an ink bottle before you start writing.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we drool when we sleep? More specifically during daytime naps...\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but it might have something to do with the body's temperature regulation. When we sleep, our body temperature increases and saliva production also increases in order to help cool the body down. This can cause drooling while sleeping.", "\n\nHuman: What's the purpose of the mysterious slash at the end of URLs?\n\nExample 1: type \"reddit\" in Google. Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: What is the purpose of the mysterious slash at the end of URLs?", "\n\nHuman: Why does the US have to be close allies with Saudi Arabia?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you think are the advantages of being close allies with Saudi Arabia?\n\n[removed]", "\n\nHuman: How is Hacking possible.\n\nThis is a really hard concept for me so please bear with me. I don't quite understand how it is even possible for someone to enter into a private or secure server or computer and bring about changes. The only way I see it working is if you some how let the virus into the system.\n\nAssistant: Well, it depends on the type of hacking. There are different methods of hacking and they each have different ways of accomplishing the same goal. For example, social engineering is a type of hacking that relies on human interaction to gain access, while other types of hacking use sophisticated software and code to gain access to a system without any physical contact. Other types of hacking involve using vulnerabilities in software or hardware to exploit the system and gain access.", "\n\nHuman: why do things like metal and lava turn red when they are are hot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What type of metal and lava?", "\n\nHuman: why pillows, blankets, etc have those tags that are \"penalized by law\" if removed by anyone but the consumer\n\n\n\nAssistant: why is the sky blue?", "\n\nHuman: Why is there a statute of limitations?\n\nIt seems like it only really protects criminals (i.e. Bill Cosby), so why do we have it?\n\nAssistant: Because it encourages people to report crimes and come forward as witnesses without fear of reprisal. It also helps to ensure that evidence is not tainted by the passage of time, which can be an issue when a crime has been committed years ago.", "\n\nHuman: How do people accidentally die from auto-erotic asphyxiation?\n\nIf the human brain can survive for upwards of 3 minutes (no training) without oxygen, how do so many people accidentally kill themselves while asphyxiating themselves/having their partner asphyxiate them during sex/masturbation? Can't they just stop choking themselves when it gets sketchy? And once they pass out, doesn't the body automatically breathe for them/if applicable their partner would stop choking them?\n\nAssistant: Well, people can accidentally kill themselves while engaging in auto-erotic asphyxiation for a variety of reasons. It is possible for people to pass out or become unconscious before they can release the choke hold, or for their partner to not realize the severity of the situation and let go in time. Additionally, the amount of time a person can survive without oxygen varies greatly from person to person, and some people may not have the physical strength or mental awareness to be able to release the choke hold before it is too late.", "\n\nHuman: The movement of long string-like things through the air/water\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the next word?", "\n\nHuman: How did humanity get this far with only recently having clean, filtered water to drink from ?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the last part of the sentence.", "\n\nHuman: What is athletes foot and why does it hurt?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Athletes foot is a fungal infection of the skin that causes itchy, red and scaly skin between the toes. It is caused by a fungus that thrives in warm, moist environments, such as sweaty feet. The fungus attacks the upper layer of the skin, causing it to become itchy and inflamed. Left untreated, the infection can spread to the surrounding skin and even to other parts of the body."]}
