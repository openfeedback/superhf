Whenever you have a foreign substance in your mouth, the nerve is stimulated, sending a signal to your brain that there is something in your mouth.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar has been around for a long time and it has been a part of the human diet since the Stone Age.  In the Stone Age, people used to get most of their calories from fat, protein, and carbohydrates.  Sugar was an occasional treat and was not a part of the normal diet.

Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: That is called a life expectancy and it is a function of the size of the organism. The smaller an organism is the shorter its life expectancy will be. This is because the smaller the organism the more quickly it will use up its energy and resources. For example, a mouse will eat a lot of food and use a lot of energy in a short amount of time, compared to a whale. The whale has a longer life expectancy because it has more energy available to it than the mouse.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I am sorry, I do not understand.

What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are the number of digits that are needed to determine the accuracy of a measurement.
