They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The AMD 6-core CPU is a Ryzen 5 3600, and the 8-core is a Ryzen 7 3800X. 6-core CPUs have 6 physical cores, and 8-core CPUs have 8 physical cores. The AMD 8-core CPU has a higher core count and higher clock speed than the Intel 6-core CPU.\n\nThe AMD CPUs also have a higher cache and are more power efficient.\n\nAs for the difference in performance, the 6-core Intel CPU is a 6", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Your eyelids twitch when you haven't gotten enough sleep because they are getting dry. If you don't blink enough, your eyes will dry out and cause irritation. The best way to prevent this is to blink often. \n\nAnother possible explanation is that you're having a muscle spasm. Muscle spasms are usually caused by stress, dehydration, or fatigue.\n\nIf you have a muscle spasm in your face, try to relax your face and stop using your face muscles. This can help with the spas", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: It is very rare that a person with a terminal illness has no symptoms until the very end. In reality, it is very common for people with terminal illnesses to have a long period of time where they have few or no symptoms. This can last anywhere from a few weeks to several years. It is actually very uncommon for a person to have symptoms for only a few days. For example, the average person with end-stage lung cancer may experience symptoms for several months to a year before the end stage of the disease is reached. \n\nWhile most people with terminal illnesses have sympt", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hold music is typically recorded in a studio with professional singers and musicians.  This ensures that the music is of the highest quality.  This also ensures that it can be played back at any time.  If it was recorded in a live setting, it would be difficult to replay at any time.  Canned and compressed music is used to reduce the amount of storage space that is required for the music.  This allows the music to be played back in a much smaller file size.  This also allows the music to be played back faster and more efficiently.  When music is compressed, it is", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There would probably be a lot of chaos and disorder, but over the long run, there could be a lot more peace in the Middle East. The region has been the site of much of the world's bloodiest conflict for the last century. There have been multiple wars fought between the Ottoman Empire and the British Empire and the French Empire. There have been many wars fought between Israel and its neighbors. There have been wars fought between Sunni and Shia Muslims. There have been wars fought between the Iraq and Iran. There have been wars fought between the Arabs and the Persians. There have been", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is considered bad for you because of the calories it contains.  For example, if you consume 100 calories of sugar, you will feel like you are fuller than if you consume 100 calories of meat.  Therefore, in a day where you need to consume 3000-3500 calories, it may be wise to limit your sugar intake to 200 calories to avoid gaining weight.  Sugar also contains fructose, which the body has a harder time metabolizing than glucose.  This may lead to", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week. However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: They do this to ensure there's always a show to talk about.  In the US, there's a constant stream of entertainment news to discuss, from the Oscars, to award shows, to the latest film releases, to the latest TV show that's been cancelled or renewed.  By airing five times a week, they have a constant stream of topics to discuss.  Additionally, it helps to create a sense of familiarity in the audience.  If they only aired once a week, the audience would be less familiar with the show, and therefore, less likely to tune", "\n\nHuman: Origin of \"In Mother Russia...\" jokes\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The \"In Mother Russia...\" jokes are a collection of jokes, usually told by English speakers, that begin with the phrase \"In Mother Russia...\" They are usually puns or play on words. The jokes are often about Russian culture and history. The jokes are often told as a joke, often making light of Russian culture or history. The jokes are often told in English, even though the Russian language is not a common language in the English speaking world. The jokes are often told by people who are not Russian, and often told by people who are not from Mother Russia. The jokes are often", "\n\nHuman: Colloidal silver?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Colloidal silver is silver that has been suspended in a solution of pure water. Colloidal silver is an antibiotic that can be used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections, acne, and wound healing. However, there is no evidence to support the effectiveness of colloidal silver for these uses. Colloidal silver has also been linked to a number of adverse effects, including kidney damage and neurological disorders. Colloidal silver is not regulated by the FDA and is not recommended as a treatment for any condition.", "\n\nHuman: Why do you \"drive\" a car, but \"pilot\" a boat, plane, etc.?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The term \"pilot\" is used for any person who controls a vehicle, whether it is on land, water, or in the air. In some cases, the person who controls the vehicle is referred to as a \"driver,\" but in most cases, the person in control of the vehicle is referred to as a \"pilot.\" A common example is the term \"pilot\" being used to refer to an airplane pilot. When referring to driving a car, the term \"driver\" is used instead of \"pilot\" because a car is a vehicle that is on land and not in the air.", "\n\nHuman: Why do popular reddit posts tend to cap out around 4k up votes when there is such a big amount of people using reddit?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the early days of reddit, the upvote system was a lot more fair. There were a lot of users who would upvote posts to try to help the post get to the front page. This allowed posts to gain a lot of upvotes quickly. As the number of users on reddit increased, the number of users upvoting posts decreased as the number of users who upvote posts for the sake of upvotes decreased. This means that the posts that are on the front page are the posts that are the most interesting and relevant to the community. This means that the most popular posts tend", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece, then the harder material would break through the softer material.  The harder material is stronger than the softer material, so it would break through.  The softer material is weaker than the harder material, so it would break.  There would be a gap between the pieces of the hardest material and the softer material.  This gap would be a small area because the harder material is smaller than the softer material.  The hardest material would have a smaller area than the softer material.  The hardest material would not have a", "\n\nHuman: Why does the Xbox One need a brick in between the outlet plug and the console where as the PS4 doesn't?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Xbox One uses an AC adapter to power the console. The PS4 uses an AC adapter to power the console and also the DualShock 4 controller. The PS4 does not have a separate brick in between the outlet plug and the console.  The PS4 has a cable with a plug on one end that plugs into the controller, and a plug on the other end that plugs into the console.  The Xbox One has a cable with a plug on one end that plugs into the console, and a plug on the other end that plugs into the console.  The Xbox", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: The green color of the chlorophyll is due to the fact that it is a pigment that absorbs blue light and reflects green light.  It has the same chemical structure as hemoglobin, a pigment that carries oxygen in the blood.  When the plant absorbs the light energy, it is transformed into chemical energy.  The process of photosynthesis is a series of chemical reactions that happen in the chloroplast, the organelle that contains the chlorophyll.  When the energy is released, it is used to create sugars that the plant can then", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Runner's high is caused by the chemical anandamide. Anandamide is a chemical that is produced in the brain and body. It is a neurotransmitter that acts on the cannabinoid receptors. It is also the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling in marijuana.\n\nAnandamide can be detected in the urine and blood, which is how it is tested for in athletes. It has a short half life and is quickly removed from the body. In order for it to be detected in the urine, the athlete must have", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A liquid becomes a solid when the viscosity becomes so great that the molecules cannot move through the liquid.  For example, water is a liquid at room temperature.  The molecules in water are not so tightly bound that they cannot move, so the viscosity is low enough that water can flow through a pipe.  When water freezes, the molecules in the liquid are so tightly bound that the viscosity of the liquid increases and the molecules cannot move.  As a result, water can no longer flow through a pipe.  This is why water can be poured into a glass,", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre was trying to gain by short-selling the stocks, which would result in a huge drop in price. He would then buy them back for a profit.", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: Mouse and monitor communicate with each other by using electrical signals.  The monitor sends out electrical signals which can be received by the mouse. The mouse translates the electrical signals into motion. The movement of the mouse is then translated into motion on the screen by the monitor. The mouse and monitor have a similar relationship as a human and their keyboard. The keyboard sends electrical signals to the monitor which the monitor then translates into letters, numbers, and symbols. The letters, numbers, and symbols are then displayed on the monitor. The monitor sends these signals to the keyboard which translates them into a series of electrical", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A mirror shot is a common technique in film and television, where the camera is placed behind the mirror, and the camera operator shoots the reflection of the actor in the mirror. In most cases, the camera is hidden behind the mirror, and the camera operator is in the same room as the actor. The director or cinematographer will give the actor a cue to look at the mirror, so they know when to do their close-up. In most cases, the actor will look at the mirror, and then continue to look at it for a few seconds, before the camera operator will get the shot. The camera operator will", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Circumcision is still a common practice in America because it is still the preferred way to prevent HIV infection, and HIV infection is still a common problem in the United States.  Circumcision also prevents other diseases such as UTI and STIs, and it is recommended by the CDC.  Many people choose to be circumcised for religious reasons, and it is still a common practice in many Jewish and Muslim cultures.  Circumcision is also practiced in many other cultures, including some European cultures, so it is not exclusive to American culture.  Circum", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons for this. First, Go is played on a larger board. This means that the number of possible board configurations is larger, and so it is harder to enumerate them all. Second, Go is a much more complex game than Chess. It has many more possible moves and many more possible outcomes, which makes it harder to enumerate all possible moves.\n\nGo is a board game similar to Chess, but played on a larger board and with more pieces. It is one of the most complex games ever created, with a huge number of possible board configurations. Chess, on the other hand, is", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: Chinese food is very labor intensive, and that is what makes it taste so good.  It\u2019s the same with any type of food.  If you are cooking something at home, you aren\u2019t going to use the same time or effort as if you were cooking it in a restaurant.  For example, when I\u2019m cooking a dish, I\u2019m going to cut up all the ingredients in advance and then put it together when I\u2019m ready to cook.  If I\u2019m cooking in a restaurant, I\u2019m not going to go to that much effort.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We squint when we try to look far away so that our pupils are smaller and the light enters the eye better. If the light is entering the eye better, our brain will receive more information about what we are looking at. This is important when we are trying to look far away so that we can make out the shapes and features of what we are looking at. \n\nIf we were looking at something far away and squinting, our pupils would be small and the light would be entering the eye very well. This means that our brain would be able to receive a lot of information about what we are looking at", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is a type of water that has carbon dioxide gas dissolved into it. The carbon dioxide is added to water at a controlled temperature, pressure, and time. The carbon dioxide is removed from the water at a controlled temperature, pressure, and time. This process is called carbonation. \n\nThe process of carbonation is used in the production of sparkling mineral water and soft drinks. The production of sparkling mineral water involves the addition of carbon dioxide to natural spring water. The process of carbonation increases the water's carbonation level, which gives", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the United States, the spelling of words is often based on the Latin or Greek etymology of the word. This is not always the case, but it is the most common. British English, on the other hand, often follows the spelling of words in the French language. For example, the French word \"herbe\" means \"herb,\" while the British English spelling of the word is \"herb.\" While the spelling differences between British and American English are often small, some words differ quite a bit. For example, the British English spelling of the word \"colour\" is \"color\"", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The temperature of the shower water changes so much with a tiny push because the water flowing through your showerhead is not just water but air as well. The air is not heated by the hot water in the pipes. When the water flowing out of the showerhead is warm, the air is heated, and when the water flowing out of the showerhead is cold, the air is not heated.", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014. What has happened during the last 12 months? Is the situation better or worse?\n\nAssistant: ISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014. What has happened during the last 12 months? Is the situation better or worse?\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was a self-proclaimed caliphate established in 2014. ISIS was active in Iraq and Syria, but also in other countries. Since the beginning of 2017 ISIS has been in a state of decline. The ISIS caliphate is now almost completely destroyed. It", "\n\nHuman: How does having a record label help bands, and how would an indie label differ from a major label?\n\nI've searched this many times but have yet to get a clear answer. anyone have a simple explanation that could be a little more clear?\n\nAssistant: 1. A record label is a company that helps manage and distribute the music of a band.", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are several different methods trains use to pull cars. In general, trains are pulled using a series of locomotives that are hooked up in a series. The locomotives use electricity or diesel fuel to generate power. The locomotives are coupled together using metal or rubber clamps that can transfer power from one to the next. This is known as a train consist. The length of the consist is limited by the number of locomotives used, and the weight of the train is limited by the weight of the locomotives. There is no limit to the number of cars a train can pull, as long as it is", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics are accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference by using the following methods:", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: The molecules of whatever is wet are more able to be transferred into the air and be detected by the nose. This is why when we sweat and it is hot out we smell, but when we are cold and wet we don't smell as much. \n\nWetness also allows things to be more slippery which is why people slip on wet floors.\n\nThings like spilled water, or a dog that just got out of the rain smell because the molecules of the liquid are being transferred into the air. \n\nThis is why we have \"water\" par", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator that will allow scientists to discover what the universe is made of, and how it was formed. The LHC is located near Geneva, Switzerland and is a large underground tunnel that is almost 17 miles long. It is the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world. The LHC is a linear particle accelerator, meaning that the particles are accelerated in a linear direction. There are two circular accelerators that are used to accelerate the particles. The LHC has a tunnel that is 16.8 miles long", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Right-wing politics is based on the idea that the individual is best served by a strong, centralized state that exerts strict control over the economy. In practice, this means that private property is heavily regulated, and that citizens must obey the state. Right-wing political parties are typically nationalist, and advocate for strong borders. \n\nLeft-wing politics is based on the idea that the individual is best served by a strong, democratic state that exerts strict control over the economy. In practice, this means that private property is heavily regulated, and that citizens must obey the state. Left", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: This is a really good question. First of all, the time you experience on earth is a very small part of the universe. It's the size of a grain of sand on the beach. The universe is so large that it is impossible to be in every place at once. So, when you think of time, you are thinking of a very small part of the universe.\n\nSo, if you were to travel to a different part of the galaxy, the time you would experience would be different. For example, if you were to travel to the center of the galaxy, you would experience time much slower.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter was created in 1793 by a Frenchman named Joseph-Louis de Lagrange. The meter was defined as the distance from the North pole to the equator through Paris, France. The reason for this distance was because Paris was the center of scientific activity during the 18th century. The meter was defined as the distance from the North pole to the equator through Paris, France. The reason for this distance was because Paris was the center of scientific activity during the 18th century. The meter was defined as the distance from the North pole to the equator through Paris, France. The reason", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a good question. The pain that you feel from something like a soap in the eye is called a 'reflex'. This is something that our body can do without us having to tell it to do it. A reflex is an automatic response to a stimulus. \nA reflex can happen in any part of the body. A reflex in the eye is called a 'lacrimation' and it makes your eyes water. The water helps to flush the soap out of your eye and it also protects your eyes from more soap getting in. \nWhen you are a little kid, you don't", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Scientists are able to determine the presence of planets light years away using the transit method. It works by measuring the dips in light of a star when a planet passes in front of it. However, the existence of a ninth planet in our solar system has not been confirmed, because it is very difficult to observe from our planet. The ninth planet was first predicted by scientists in 1984, but it was only confirmed in 2018. The ninth planet is so far away from us that it is only visible with the biggest telescopes on earth. The ninth planet", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Newly-bedded black widow spiders eat their mates to digest the sperm and get rid of it. This is a common practice in many spider species. This behavior is very rare in other animals, which means that it must be beneficial for the spider to do this. \n\nAfter mating, the male black widow spider will try to hide in a crevice and wait for the female to find him. The male has a very short life span, and the female will eat him to absorb the sperm. This will allow the female spider to lay eggs later in the", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is believed that citrus fruits are sweet because their seeds are not viable and thus do not need to be dispersed to new locations. In this case, they are not meant to encourage animals to eat them and carry the seeds away from the parent tree.\n\nLemons and limes, on the other hand, do have seeds that can be dispersed and thus are a viable food source for animals. \n\nLemons and limes also have a very high amount of citric acid which is bitter and acidic. It is likely that this was a means of discou", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: The payment is usually not disclosed. If it is, it is usually a percentage of the movie's budget. A company can have a lot of say over the placement of their product and the number of times it is shown in the movie.\n\nThe most common way a product is placed in a movie is to have the product displayed or used by a character. The product may also be mentioned or shown in a scene.\n\nFor example, in the movie \"Wonder Woman\", the character Diana Prince wears a branded watch. In the movie, this watch is used by Diana Prince to track the", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: In Word, there are several steps that Word takes before it sends the link to the browser. It sends the link to the browser, but before it does, it has to generate the link, open a new tab, copy the link, close the tab, send the link to the browser, and finally, open the link in the browser. \n\nIf Word does all of this and sends the link to the browser, it is much slower than simply clicking on the link in Word and having it open in the browser. The extra steps that Word takes to generate the link and send it to the browser are what cause Word to slow", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: Horses are not killed.  Horses are euthanized or put down if they are in constant pain or if they have a terminal illness.\n\nIt is a common misconception that horses are killed after being injured.  Horses are put down after being injured when they are in constant pain and are not able to be treated to recovery.  Horses are also put down when they are terminally ill, such as when they have cancer or have a contagious disease that would be passed onto other horses.  Horses are euthanized at the owner\u2019s dis", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: Cyprus was divided in 1974 when the Turkish Cypriots invaded the island. The UN, US, UK, and other nations have tried to bring the two parties together and to have a settlement, but it has never been achieved. As a result of this, Cyprus is still divided, with the northern part of the island under Turkish control. The island is recognized by the UN as a sovereign nation and has been a member of the EU since 2004.", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: This is a good question. The general idea is that children are the easiest to preserve. They do not grow as much as adults and their bones are lighter and more fragile. They are also more fragile than adults and break more easily so it is much easier to find the bones of children. This is also aided by the fact that children are small and are often buried in small graves. They are also buried in different ways to adults which means that they are often buried in a more vertical position (with their legs and head sticking up). This means that their bones are more likely to", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The most common answer to this question is that sexual dimorphism is the result of sexual selection. The species in which the sexes are very different in size, appearance, and behavior have a very high probability of being the result of sexual selection. Sexual selection is the process by which traits are favored in the breeding process based on their effects on reproductive success. A good example of this is the peacock, who has an impressive tail that serves no practical function. However, females are attracted to males with impressive tails, and thus the males are more likely to survive and pass on their", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: There is a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet.  The limit is called bandwidth.  There are two types of bandwidth.  One is the rate at which information can be sent.  This is called upstream bandwidth.  The other is the rate at which information can be received.  This is called downstream bandwidth.  Upstream bandwidth is usually limited to 15mbps.  Downstream bandwidth is usually limited to 25mbps.  These are limits set by your internet service provider.

They do this by going to bed earlier, or by sleeping outside.  Many people also prefer to wake up with a bell or music, rather", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: You are correct that the coin flip is independent of any previous flip.  In fact, the coin flip is independent of any flip that happened in the past, and any flip that will happen in the future.  In other words, the coin flip is truly random.\n\nThere are three reasons that the coin flip is truly random.\n\nFirst, the coin flip is a physical process.  The coin is not a computer, and the coin flip is not a decision-making process.  The coin flip is an actual physical process, and thus cannot be influenced by the", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun was a peripheral that used a light sensor to determine when the gun was pointed at a screen. The gun's light sensor was a triangular array of light-emitting diodes that fired a beam of infrared light at the television screen. When the beam hit a pixel, the light sensor measured the time it took for the light to reach the pixel and return to the gun. The gun's computer calculated the distance to the pixel from the delay time and angle of the incoming light. The gun also had a laser sight on the front, which was used as a visual targeting", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The US has no formal system for deporting non-criminal undocumented immigrants. This is because the US has a very large number of undocumented immigrants (estimated to be more than 11 million people) and many of these people have been in the country for decades and have family and community ties. This is why ICE generally only targets violent felons and those who have been deported before. However, there are a number of cities that have made it a policy to cooperate with ICE, which has led to a number of non-violent undocument", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The percentage sign is not defined for 0 divided by 0. In fact, the percentage sign is 0 divided by 0.0.\n\nThe reason for this is that percentage is a ratio of two numbers. 0 divided by 0.0 is a number, but it is not a ratio. 0 divided by 0.0 is the same as 0 divided by 0. \n\nWhen you divide two numbers, you get a number. For example, 1 divided by 1 is 1. When you divide two numbers, you can divide by 0, but you will get", "\n\nHuman: why does comcast Internet slow down despite offering 20+mbps\n\nAssistant: Comcast Internet is a shared connection, which means that your speed is not guaranteed. In addition, the amount of data that you are sending and receiving at any given time can impact your speed. \n\nIf your internet connection is slowing down, there are a few steps you can take to improve your speed. \n1. Check your speed. You can do this by going to speedtest.com or using the Comcast Speedtest app. \n2. Use your phone's cellular data connection instead of WiFi to watch videos, stream music, and download files. This will help ensure your Comcast Internet", "\n\nHuman: how do apps like prankdial work?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Some apps like PrankDial (https://www.prankdial.com/) have a website which allows users to create their own pranks. The app then calls the number on the website and plays the prank.", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens if you ignore medical bills? [USA]\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It depends on your state. If you ignore medical bills, you may have to pay collection costs. If the bill is more than $5,000, the bill may be sent to a collection agency. \nOnce you have medical bills sent to a collection agency, the debt will be reported to the credit bureaus and will affect your credit score. \nIf you ignore medical bills and fail to pay them, the bill will go to collection. \nIf you have a medical bill sent to collections, your credit score will be damaged. \nIf you have a medical bill", "\n\nHuman: If I smoke pot, and a week later get in a car accident where someone dies, will i go to prison?\n\nI know whenever someone is seriously injured or killed in a car accident, both drivers blood are taken to check for intoxication.  Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: I do not have enough information to answer your question, but it is very possible that you could go to prison.  It would depend on the state you are in, the circumstances of the accident, and any evidence found in the car to suggest that you were high.  In California, it is a crime to be under the influence of any mind altering substance while driving, and you can go to prison for up to 10 years for that.  So it would depend on your state.\n\nHowever, I do not believe that it would be a manslaughter charge, since the accident was not your", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: One another is a phrase that has been around for centuries. It is derived from the phrase 'one and another' which is an expression that was used in the 17th century to mean 'one and another' (as in one and another person).  The phrase is grammatically correct and is often used to mean 'one more person' or 'another person' (as in one more person to take a particular job, or one more person to join a group or team).  For example, one and another person (or people) may be added to a team or a group.  The phrase can also be used", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: The plastic bolt and wing nuts are used to keep the toilet seat from falling off the toilet. It's a safety feature to prevent children and pets from falling into the toilet. \n\nIf you don't use the wing nuts, you will have a loose toilet seat that can fall off the toilet. \n\nThe plastic bolt is used to prevent the toilet seat from falling off the toilet. \n\nTo avoid the plastic bolt coming loose, you should use the wing nuts. \n\nIt", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: Growing up is like a journey. You begin as a child and then slowly, but surely, you grow up and become an adult. Along the way you learn many things. You learn that you should do what is right and not what is wrong. You learn how to be responsible. You learn how to make decisions for yourself. You learn that sometimes you need to be independent, and sometimes you need to depend on others. You learn to appreciate the world around you and the people in it. You learn that there is no right or wrong, just a lot of gray areas.\n\nAs you grow older, you", "\n\nHuman: If there's being such serious human rights violations goiing on in Qatar, and FIFA aren't doing anything about it, then how come none of the world governments or the UN are putting pressure on something to be done?\n\n\n\nAssistant: FIFA are a private company with a global brand, if they were to be pressured by other governments or the UN they would lose their global brand and they would be unable to continue their work. They are heavily dependent on Qatar to help fund their World Cup tournaments and will not risk that income stream. If FIFA are not doing anything about the human rights abuses going on in Qatar then the governments are not going to intervene as they are also benefiting from the World Cup being held in Qatar. The UN have not intervened as they are not an intergovernmental organisation and they have no real", "\n\nHuman: Sure Deposit\n\nI am being told that, despite having deposit in the name, it's just an unrelated fee.  I'm having trouble finding information on sure deposit, it seems like I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nAssistant: Sure deposit is a fee for sure deposit, not a deposit, and is not unrelated to your deposit. It is the fee that the bank charges you if you want to deposit a check immediately. The fee is a percentage of the check amount, usually 1-2% of the check amount. It is a fee the bank charges you for a service. It is not unrelated to your deposit, it is a service provided by the bank.", "\n\nHuman: If viruses such as Ebola have no cure, how come some people recover from the disease?\n\nHow come the virus doesn't keep multiplying until it kills the person?\n\nAssistant: This is a great question. The reason that a virus doesn't keep multiplying indefinitely is because the immune system keeps killing off the virus. This means that the body is trying to kill the virus. This is a good thing! We want the immune system to keep fighting off viruses.\n\nThe reason that people can recover from a virus is because the immune system is able to keep fighting the virus until it is defeated. This can happen because the virus is not strong enough to keep multiplying or because the virus is weakened by the immune system.\n\nAnother way that a virus can", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Getting up in the morning is hard because you have to get out of bed, face the day, and get to work or school. This is dreadful because it takes up time that you could be spending doing something more enjoyable, such as sleeping or watching TV. It is also hard because you have to do it every day, and that can be tiring. If you don't get enough sleep, then it can be even more difficult to get up in the morning. \n\nGetting up in the morning is dreadful because you have to face the day and get to work or school. This is hard", "\n\nHuman: Why do pupils dilate on drugs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Dilation of the pupils is a sign that a person is under the influence of drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine. A healthy pupil will dilate in response to light. This is a protective mechanism to prevent damage from excessive light. If a pupil does not respond to light, this is a sign of a problem in the brain.\n\nPupils dilate when a person is under the influence of drugs. Dilated pupils are an indication that the person has taken a drug that causes the pupils to widen. The pupils will dilate", "\n\nHuman: Why do most men go bald, in spite of all the testosterone?\n\nI'm 25, I have a full beard, I have new hair coming out on my back and shoulders but the hair on top of my head have started falling. What's up with that? Are the rules different for that part of the body?\n\nEDIT: What the hell? Ads about hair products started showing on reddit. Ads do get smarter. \n\nAssistant: In most men, baldness is due to the action of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on the hair follicles. DHT is an androgen hormone that is derived from testosterone. Although testosterone is the primary androgen in men, DHT is the androgen that is responsible for male pattern baldness. \n\nDHT causes the hair follicles in the front of the scalp to shrink, resulting in the balding pattern seen in most men. \n\nIt is not clear why men are more susceptible to male pattern baldness", "\n\nHuman: the mechanism allowing or causing flowers to track the sun as it moves across the sky.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Heliosim is the mechanism allowing or causing flowers to track the sun as it moves across the sky.\n\nThe flower petals of many plants, including morning glories and sunflowers, are able to track the sun's movements across the sky. This is because the petals have a specialized set of cells called heliosomes that can sense the direction of the sun's light. These cells can sense light and actively move to keep the flower in the direction of the sun. The heliosomes are able to sense the direction of the sunlight because they contain a pigment called phy", "\n\nHuman: why does so many people hate the Baby boomer generation?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Baby boomers are generally thought of as a large group of people born between 1946 and 1964. The name originated from the post-World War II economic boom and the rapid population growth that occurred in the United States during that time period.\n\nBaby boomers are the generation that came after the World War II generation, and they were often considered to be more rebellious than the generations before them, such as the Silent Generation. The term \"Baby boomers\" became widely used in the 1960s and 1970", "\n\nHuman: [deleted by user]\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: [removed]\n\n- [deleted by user] is a [deleted by user]\n\n- [deleted by user] is not a [deleted by user]\n\n- [deleted by user] is a [deleted by user]\n\n- [deleted by user] is not a [deleted by user]\n\n- [deleted by user] is a [deleted by user]\n\n- [deleted by user] is not a [deleted by user]\n\n- [deleted by user] is a [deleted by user]", "\n\nHuman: Why are many guys perfectly fine with having sex with a stranger if they're attractive, while few girls would? Is there a biological dofference in their libido?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It is commonly believed that men are more sexually promiscuous than women. This is because the former are more likely to have multiple partners in their lifetime, and they are also more likely to have had premarital sex. However, this is not always the case. According to the study published in the Journal of Sex Research, 28% of men and 41% of women have had sex with someone they did not know well. This suggests that gender is not the only factor that determines sexual behavior. Other factors such as sexual orientation, social status, and culture also play a role. \n\nFor", "\n\nHuman: We have vitamin A , B, C, D, E and K but not F, G, H, I and J. Why?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Vitamins A, B, C, D, E and K are fat-soluble vitamins and can be stored in the body. They are used to maintain the health of our skin, eyes, and immune system. The remaining vitamins such as F, G, H, I and J are water-soluble vitamins and are not stored in the body. The body does not store them and needs regular supplies. They are used to maintain the health of our bones, teeth, and skin.  \n\nF, G, H, I and J are water soluble vit", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that sometimes I can poop with perfection only needing to wipe once and other times I need to wipe multiple times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The perfection of your poop is a result of a couple factors. The first factor is the type of food that you are eating. Certain foods can cause you to have a less than perfect poop. For example, eating too much dairy can cause constipation. So, if you are eating a lot of dairy, you are more likely to have a less than perfect poop. The second factor is the amount of water that you are drinking. If you are not drinking enough water, your poop will be hard and dry. This will lead to more times needing to w", "\n\nHuman: What Is the Chomsky Grammar Heirarchy and How Does It Work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Chomsky's grammar heirarchy is a set of rules that are used to describe how human language is structured. The basic rules are:\n1) Every sentence has a Subject, a Verb, and an Object\n2) Every sentence has a Subject and a Verb\n3) Every sentence has a Subject and an Adjective\n4) Every sentence has a Subject and an Adverb\n\nThe heirarchy has 4 levels, the first level being simple sentences, the second level being compound sentences, the third level being complex sentences, and the fourth level being compound-complex sentences", "\n\nHuman: why almost every japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children\n\nI have just noticed this trend tbh and i never wondered why this was. It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons why this is the case.\n\n1) It's easier to write a story about children because you can make the antagonist more \"adult\" and therefore more complex, and it makes it more engaging.\n\n2) It's easier to develop a child's personality, since the audience is more willing to empathize with them.\n\n3) It's easier to portray the struggles of childhood, and the audience can more easily relate to them.\n\n4) It's easier to portray \"coming-of-age\" stories with", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a state of deep sleep during the winter where animals do not eat or drink, and where their body temperature drops to below freezing. A hibernating animal's heartbeat slows down and their body metabolism slows down to match their reduced activity levels. If a hibernating animal needs to move they can do so in an instant.\n\nHibernating animals are often found in burrows and tunnels, where they can sleep in one place without the worry of being eaten by predators. Hibernation is not the same as sleeping, as hibernation", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The main reason why it is easier to understand a language than speak it is that learning a language in a classroom setting is generally a slow process. Students take years to learn a language. Once they have learned it, they can understand it, but they are not ready to speak it yet. The best way to improve speaking skills is to practice speaking the language with others. It is easier to understand a language than to speak it. \n\nIn contrast, when people learn to speak, they learn to pronounce the words, how to put them together to make sentences, how to use the tenses, and how to use", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: The Braille alphabet was invented in 1824 by a man named Louis Braille. Braille is a tactile alphabet, so it is designed to be read by touch. The Braille alphabet has six dots, which are raised, and three dots which are sunken. The dots are arranged into cells. The six raised dots are arranged in two parallel lines, with three dots in each line. The three dots in each line are arranged in a triangular formation. The three dots that are sunken are arranged in two parallel lines, with one dot in each line. The d", "\n\nHuman: What volume of water is required to drown a human?\n\nAnd a second, slightly sillier question, can someone drown swallowing only a mouthful of water?\n\nAssistant: The correct answer to the first question is that the volume of water required to drown a human depends on the size of the human. A standard adult human, for example, weighs about 140 pounds, and the volume of water required to submerge that weight in water is about 60 gallons. In other words, the volume of water required to drown a person is roughly 60 gallons. The volume of water that a person can swallow in one gulp is not known precisely. The volume of water required to drown a human is so large that a person could not", "\n\nHuman: what is the reason for those few extra blank white pages in the back of a book?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That space is for the printer to leave room to print the last page of the book. It also allows the reader to see that the book ends on a full page, and not a page with a few lines at the bottom.", "\n\nHuman: Meditation\n\nHow do I do it? What does it do? Does it actually work?\n\nAssistant: Meditation is a practice that has been around for thousands of years. It\u2019s used by many religions and cultures to help us connect with our inner selves, and the universe. Many people who meditate report that it helps them feel more centered, calm, and happy. Meditation is something that anyone can learn to do, and it\u2019s often done with the help of a teacher, or a group. It can take as little as 5 minutes, or it can take hours to complete a session. Meditation can be done anywhere, and it can be done on your own. There are many techniques, and", "\n\nHuman: Why can insurance companies charge based on race/sex/age and not be sued for discrimination?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The insurance company cannot be sued for discrimination because they are a for-profit company that is in the business of making money. In order to make money, insurance companies need to know the risks of who they are insuring and how much to charge them for their insurance. This is why insurance companies can charge different rates for different people. A person\u2019s age, race, and gender are all indicators of their health and their susceptibility to certain illnesses.\n\nInsurance companies are also required to follow the guidelines of the Fair Housing Act (F", "\n\nHuman: What is the dust on your eyes after you wake up?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: Dust on your eyes is the residual debris from your eye lashes that may have been deposited on your eyelids during the night. This is a common problem, and you should clean your eyes every morning to prevent it from getting worse over time. This debris can be removed with a soft cotton swab dipped in warm water. \n\nIf you have a large amount of debris that is hard to remove, you can try a slightly abrasive scrubbing solution. You can make a simple homemade solution with one part baking soda to three parts", "\n\nHuman: How would a write in candidate win a national election considering that there might be and probably are other people with the exact same name?\n\nIn the context of people talking about write in candidates for this upcoming election, I was just wondering how this works.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: If a write-in candidate wins, it is because he has won the votes. The votes are cast for the write-in candidate and not the name on the ballot. The name on the ballot is just a reference for the write-in candidate. The write-in candidate must have a significant number of votes to win.\n\nThe only way to make sure a write-in candidate wins is to write-in their name. Voting for any other name would be a vote for the name on the ballot.\n\nIf there are multiple candidates with the same name, the votes will be counted for the candidate", "\n\nHuman: How did people used to train pigeons to carry mail at the long distance, back in the day?\n\nI was always curious, did they have different pigeon for each address and if not, how pigeon knows whom to send? \n\nAssistant: 1. Pigeons were trained to carry messages or mail from one place to another. \n2. Pigeons were trained to carry messages by pairing a bird with a human. \n3. Pigeons were trained to carry messages by using a pigeon post bag which would be attached to the pigeon\u2019s leg. \n4. Pigeons were trained to carry messages by the human training the pigeon to recognize the message. \n5. Pigeons were trained to carry messages by using the message to train the pigeon. \n6. Pigeons", "\n\nHuman: Why are people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war shamed instead of admired? Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure if I agree with you that it was a bad idea. It was a war that was fought because of political reasons. The US and Viet Nam were in a proxy war between the Soviet Union and the United States. The US was fighting a proxy war for the Soviet Union. The Vietnamese were fighting a proxy war for China. The Americans were fighting to stop the spread of communism, the Vietnamese were fighting to stop the spread of imperialism. Both were fighting for very different reasons, but the US and Vietnam were fighting the same enemy. It was a war that was fought to defend the US and", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: It is unlikely that we will be able to bring a Neanderthal back into existence, and the reason is that we do not know the precise genome of a Neanderthal.  As of today, we have only sequenced 2 Neanderthal genomes, and they were from two different individuals.  The Neanderthal genome is different from the modern human genome, but it is still not clear how different.  It is not clear that it is possible to synthesize a Neanderthal genome from the modern human genome.  It is possible that a virus could be", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender person is someone who identifies as the opposite gender than the one they were born with. A transsexual person is someone who has a physical sex change (e.g., hormone treatments, surgery). There is also a third category of transgender called genderqueer, which refers to people who do not identify with any particular gender.\n\nThere are many different reasons why people may identify as transgender or transsexual. Some people are transgender because they are not comfortable with their birth gender. Other people may have always felt like the opposite gender than the one they were born with. Some", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because smoking marijuana increases the levels of the hormone dopamine in the brain. The brain receptors for dopamine are located in the reward system of the brain, which is responsible for pleasure and fun. So when the levels of dopamine increase, it makes people feel better and more funny.\nIn addition, smoking marijuana also increases the levels of the hormone anandamide, which is also responsible for making people feel good.\nWhen marijuana is smoked, it contains a compound called THC, which is a cannabinoid, that", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: First, they are all locally owned. There are no national package stores like Wine and Spirits in New England. \nSecond, New Englanders love their beer and wine. So, these package stores have a lot of products that people love and buy on a regular basis.\nFinally, these package stores are in neighborhoods, so people can easily walk to get what they need.\nSo, if you live in a neighborhood with a package store, you will have easy access to your favorite beer, wine, and other beverages.\nTherefore, you can go to your favorite package store to", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Shrimp turns orange when cooked because it contains a pigment called astaxanthin. Astaxanthin is a carotenoid, which is a family of compounds that are found in plants and animals that give them their red, orange and yellow colors. Carotenoids are used by animals to protect their skin from UV rays, and so shrimp use astaxanthin to help protect their bodies from UV rays in the ocean. Carotenoids are also used by animals to signal health and status. Astaxanthin is a carotenoid, so it is used by", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: The calculator is trying to do division and it doesn't know how to do it because the answer would be infinity. The calculator doesn't try to do anything else, just displays an error.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: People love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food because it is easy to get, fast to prepare, and tasty.\nPeople love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food because it is easy to get, fast to prepare, and tasty. It is easy to get because most fast food restaurants are open 24 hours a day and have drive-throughs to make it easier to get food. Fast food is also fast to prepare because it does not need to be cooked for a long time. The food is prepared quickly because the food is already", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: This is a very good question. There are a few reasons why American politics are becoming more polarized.\n\nFirst, the two main political parties are more and more alienated from each other. This is because they represent two very different views of how to solve social and economic problems.\n\nThe Democratic Party is a party of the social and economic left, which favors big government and higher taxes. The Republican Party is a party of the social and economic right, which favors small government and lower taxes.\n\nIt has become increasingly difficult for members of the two parties to find common ground and to work", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods? Meaning, you had to live in the same block/city to connect to it? \n\n\nAssistant: BBS was the original form of online bulletin board system.  BBS was the original form of online bulletin board system.  It was an early online community that connected local users.  The software was simple, but it allowed users to connect to a local BBS and share messages with other users.  The BBS allowed users to connect to a local BBS and share messages with other users.  A BBS is the first form of online community, and it allowed users to connect to a local BBS and share messages with other users.  The software was simple, but it allowed users to connect to a local", "\n\nHuman: What is Russell's paradox? and please explain like i am 5, i don't know anything.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Russell's paradox is a statement that refers to the problem of self-reference. The paradox is that it is impossible to construct a set of all sets which are not members of themselves. \n\nIf we create a set called S that contains all sets that are not members of themselves, then we would need to add ourselves to the set S. If we do this, then we would be a member of the set S, and therefore we would not be a member of S.\n\nIf we don't add ourselves to the set, then we would not be a member of S, and we would", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: In Iran, there is a tradition of a person having a _Surgery_ to change gender. This is something that has happened throughout history. This surgery is called _Sex Reassignment Surgery_, or SRS. The idea is that a person is born in the wrong body, and needs to undergo surgery to change their gender. This is a fairly common thing, and has been for many years.\n\nI don't know the history of this practice, but I believe it has been a long tradition in Iran. It is not something that has been done in the last few decades,", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: Depression is a side effect of many prescription drugs because many prescription drugs can be addictive, and it can be difficult to stop taking them. They are also designed to address only a specific problem, but that problem can create other problems that require another drug to address. This can lead to the side effect of depression. \n\nSome medications, such as antidepressants, can be addictive and can cause depression. Other medications, such as narcotic pain relievers, can cause depression. \n\nWhen people take medications, they usually take them for", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear? Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: Water is blue/green because of the reflection of the sky. When sunlight hits the water, it is scattered. This causes the light to reflect off of the water. The water will reflect the blue color of the sky, and the green color of the sky. This is why the water appears blue. There are many living organisms in the water. These organisms are called plankton. These organisms are microscopic. The organisms that live in the water are mostly algae and small fish. These organisms are responsible for the color of the water. When the light hits the algae or fish, it", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES zapper for Duck Hunt was a plastic gun that was used to shoot ducks on the NES. The gun had a light that would flash when you shot the duck, and the screen would show the duck flying. The zapper also worked as a light gun on other games like Galaga. The zapper has a light gun that shines a beam of light on the TV screen, and the screen would show the light beam hitting the target. The zapper gun was a passive gun that did not have a battery in it. The gun did not require any active circuitry to work", "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between 32 and 64bit computer systems, and why aren't there, say 128bit systems.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 32-bit systems have 32-bit registers and are limited to 4GB of memory. 64-bit systems have 64-bit registers and can address 18446744073709551616 bytes. 128-bit systems would have 128-bit registers and be able to address 524288230948198511728 bytes. 128-bit systems are currently not practical and not really used. 32-bit", "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Some programs, such as Microsoft Outlook, will keep running even when the system is frozen.  Ctrl+Alt+Del is a way to manually restart the entire system, which will allow all applications to start again.  Some applications, however, will keep running even after the system is restarted.  In this case, the task manager may be able to manually kill the application in question, which will allow the system to start again.  However, sometimes the application may be stuck in a loop and cannot be killed.  In this case, it is best to restart the entire system again and hope that the application will", "\n\nHuman: How will new gun laws prevent mass shootings?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The best way to prevent mass shootings is to reduce the supply of guns in the USA. That is why new laws are being passed. The new laws require background checks for all gun sales and also ban certain semi-automatic guns. The laws are expected to reduce the number of mass shootings in the USA, which currently have a rate of 25.4 per million people per year, compared to 2.9 per million people per year in Japan. \n\nThe laws will not make it impossible to get a gun, but will make it much harder for people who are likely to use a gun to kill people", "\n\nHuman: Why do banks offer interest? What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Banks offer interest to depositors because they want to attract depositors. Banks want to attract depositors because they want to earn money through interest. Banks make money through interest by taking in deposits from people and lending out the money to other people. This is what is known as the \u201cmoney multiplier\u201d effect. Depositors want to get interest because they want to make money through interest. Banks have to pay interest to depositors because they want to attract depositors. \n\nBanks also make money from interest when they lend to other banks. Banks borrow money from other banks", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There is a growing consensus that inequality has been rising in the United States for at least the last few decades. However, there is also a debate about whether the level of inequality today is actually higher than in the past. Some researchers argue that the levels of income inequality we are seeing today are much more extreme than in the past. They base their argument on the fact that the historical levels of inequality were measured at the time using different standards. The measurement standards of today are different, so we can only compare the levels of inequality today to the levels of inequality that we know from the past. \n\nOthers argue that", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge? If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: The height of an overpass is displayed so that trucks can avoid overpasses. A truck has a large blind spot in front of the cab, and if a truck is too tall it could be too tall to clear the overpass. This is especially important for overpasses with low clearances.\n\nIf you are driving a car, you are unlikely to be too tall to clear the overpass, but a semi-truck is likely to be too tall.\n\nIf you are driving a car, you should take it slow, and look for overpass signs that tell you how tall the over", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly. I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: The shell was a large one. The fireworks were set off immediately. The shell was not designed to burst into a large fireball. It was designed to explode from the concussion of the fireworks going off and the blast from the fireworks. \n\nIt was probably a shell made of gunpowder. It would have exploded and the concussion would have killed him instantly. It would have caused a great deal of damage to his head and body and he would have died from the injuries. \n\nA fireball would not be produced from a shell of this type. It would have", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: A couple of reasons: \n\n1.  The air is drier in winter, which leads to the air being less dense.  When air is less dense, sound waves are longer and thus can travel further.\n\n2.  The trains are less likely to have ice on them in winter, and thus are more likely to be louder.  This is a minor effect, but trains are also less likely to be passing by at night in winter, and the noise of the trains going by is amplified by the silence of the night.\n\nThe train noise may also be amplified by the wind", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: Some people feel that a higher level of education is what leads to a more liberal perspective. This is because liberalism emphasizes the rights of individuals to be treated with respect and equality. This is an idea that is not easily found in the right-wing political sphere.\n\nBeyond the idea of liberalism itself, education tends to lead to a more liberal perspective. This is because education tends to lead to more worldly experience. This is because the more educated someone is, the more they tend to have experience with other cultures, other ideologies, and other people. As a result, they are more likely to be", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Many factors contribute to how people sound when they sing. First of all, singing is a completely different use of the voice than speaking. The voice is a complex instrument and when we sing, we use different muscles in the throat and mouth than when we speak. These muscles have different shapes and strengths and are made up of different tissues and structures. When we sing, these muscles are activated in different ways than when we speak. \n\nAnother factor is the size and shape of the vocal tract. When we speak, we shape our mouth and tongue differently than when we sing. This affects the", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water vapour is a gas. It is in a constant state of motion. It is also in a constant state of seeking equilibrium. For a cloud to form, water vapour needs to be cooled to a temperature where it can condense into a liquid. Once condensed, the liquid will continue to cool until it becomes a solid. A cloud can be formed as soon as a single water droplet can form. As the water droplet cools, it will grow in size. As it grows, it will attract more water vapour. The droplet will grow until it is too", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: There is a great deal of variation in the lifespans of different animals. There are a few theories on why this is. The first is that larger animals have larger bodies which means they are more efficient at carrying out processes that use energy. This means that they require less food and energy to live. In comparison, smaller animals require more food to maintain their body and this means they require more time to find food and this is more energy intensive. As larger animals have more energy available to them, they have more time to live and reproduce.\n\nThe other theory is that smaller animals have a higher metabolic rate. This", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In the English language, \"mom\" and \"dad\" are the terms for the parents of a child. This is because both are terms used to refer to the person who is the mother or father of another person. In many other languages, the parents of a child are referred to by their given names. For example, in Spanish, a child's mother is called \"mam\u00e1\" and their father is called \"pap\u00e1\", while in French, a child's mother is called \"maman\" and their father is called \"papa\". In both languages, however, the child's father is", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are used to determine if a number is an exact value or just a rough estimate. For example, 123.25 would be a precise number, while 123.5 would be a rough estimate. When adding numbers, you would want to add the exact number of digits to the final number. If you only add the first two digits, then the final result is 22.3 + 3.45 = 25.75. However, if you add all the digits, then the final result is 22.30345 + 3", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Your liver breaks down fat and releases bile into the small intestine. The gallbladder stores bile. Fats are broken down by the pancreas and saliva. The liver makes bile and stores it in the gallbladder. The liver and gallbladder work together to digest fat. Fat digestion is complicated. The liver makes bile which is stored in the gallbladder. Fat is digested by the pancreas and saliva. The pancreas and liver work together to digest fat. The liver makes bile", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high pitch ringing noise is called \"dead air\" and it is usually caused by a faulty capacitor. The ringing noise when turning off an old TV is called \"dead wiring\" and it is usually caused by a faulty solder joint. \n\nDead air is caused by a faulty capacitor. \nCapacitors are passive components that store energy. They can be in the form of an electrolytic capacitor, ceramic capacitor, or a tantalum capacitor. In an electrolytic capacitor, a liquid is used to store", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many reasons why batteries run out of power. The biggest reasons are:\n\n1. The chemical reaction that occurs inside a battery will eventually wear out the chemicals inside the battery.\n2. If the battery is not being used often enough, the chemicals inside the battery will begin to wear down.\n3. If the battery is being used too often, the chemicals inside the battery will wear down faster.\n4. The battery is defective.\n\nThese are the most common reasons why batteries run out of power.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that batteries have", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: In general, children are less inhibited than adults and so are more likely to act on impulse. Also, a lot of kids love to pretend they are a ball. \n\nI'm guessing that there are also some specific reasons for spinning in circles. For example, it is common for kids to spin around when they are happy. \n\nIt is also possible that there is something about the act of spinning in circles that is innately pleasing, and that's why kids like it so much. \n\nThis article talks about the psychology of spinning", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Big Bang Theory LI5 is the process of how the universe started and how we arrived here today. It is the theory that the universe was created in a singularity. A singularity is a point of infinite density, meaning that matter was so compressed in a single point that space and time did not exist. A singularity is the only point in the universe that can generate a black hole. There is no way to prove that a singularity existed, but it has been proven that the universe expanded from a single point. Since we know that the universe expanded from a singularity, the Big Bang Theory is the most widely accepted", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Beats are the number of times a single measure repeats. Each measure is a bar.\n\nTo count beats and bars, you count the number of measures in the song. Then you count the number of beats in each measure. The number of beats is the same as the number of bars.\n\nCounting beats and bars can help you figure out where to start or stop playing. For example, if you're playing a song that repeats 4 times, you can start playing on the 3rd measure and the last measure.\n\nBars are a measure of time. The number", "\n\nHuman: The Jerry Springer Show\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The Jerry Springer Show is an American syndicated tabloid talk show hosted by Jerry Springer. It debuted in 1991 and became a staple of daytime television in the United States and Canada. It is distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and is produced by NBCUniversal Television Distribution and Debmar-Mercury. The show's original title was The Jerry Springer Show, but it was changed to simply Jerry Springer in 2018. The program is broadcast in most markets on weekday afternoons. It is a talk show in which brawls,", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: This is actually a very interesting question, because it is not only humans that find animals cute.  For example, one study found that 84% of people surveyed found baby pandas cute, while only 26% found baby crocodiles cute.  In addition, the study found that the cuteness of a species is not related to how dangerous it is.  For example, many people find baby alligators and baby bears cute, while at the same time people find baby tarantulas and baby scorpions very creepy.  This suggests that cuteness may be an evol", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet is a technology that allows a single cable to carry both electrical power and data.  Because there is only one cable, it is possible to use power over ethernet instead of power cords.  This makes it possible to easily add a device to a network by simply plugging the power cable into a power outlet and the data cable into a network switch.  This technology has many advantages, including reduced wiring and improved safety.  It is also much more convenient for customers.  Power over ethernet is available on most modern networks and is a preferred technology.  It is also becoming", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We can see colours because we have cone cells in our retina that have different sensitivities to different wavelengths of light.  These cells, when stimulated by light, send signals to the brain which, via our visual cortex, perceives colours.  This is different to most other animals, because most animals only have rod cells in their retina.  Rod cells are only sensitive to black and white.  They are useful for night vision and other low light situations, but they do not allow us to perceive colours.  The difference is that we have three types of cone cells, whereas most other", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a lot of reasons why 3rd world countries are so underdeveloped. Some of the reasons are that they are very poor in terms of natural resources, they have a lack of technology, they have a lack of infrastructure and they are not able to keep up with the rest of the world. Another reason why they are underdeveloped is because they are very poor in terms of education, they are unable to provide their children with proper education. Also, 3rd world countries are very poor in terms of healthcare, they are unable to provide their citizens with proper healthcare and they are not able to keep up", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: Many government agencies are required to provide public access to information. As a result, government agencies are required to create public websites that provide information about the agency and the services it provides. \n\nThese websites are often required to provide a variety of information, including how to contact the agency, how to file a complaint, how to access information, how to apply for certain services, and many other types of information. \n\nIn order to accomplish these goals, many government agencies rely on third-party contractors to manage their website. This means that the government agencies are not actually responsible for creating", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: I've always wondered this myself. My guess is that when you cut vegetables, you expose the stomata (openings on the surface of the leaves) to the salt, and this causes the release of water.\n\nI believe that salt also triggers the same reaction in fruit, so that when you add salt to a fruit bowl, the fruit releases its water.\n\nI've also read that this is why cabbage and other leafy greens are not a good choice for salads - the release of water reduces the amount of food available to eat.  It is best to only cut the", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Our hands get wrinkly or soft when in water for a long time because of the moisture in the water. Our skin is a protective layer that helps us keep in our body heat. When in water for a long time, our skin absorbs a lot of the water that is in the water. Our body has to try to keep our body temperature stable so it works harder to keep us warm. The moisture that is absorbed by our skin can take longer to evaporate. This causes our skin to get wrinkly. When we are out of the water our skin is able to dry faster and", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: This is because the light from the objects are so far away that it takes many years for it to reach us, but the equipment left on the Moon is close enough that the light takes only a few seconds to reach us. In the same way that we cannot see the Sun at night, we cannot see the equipment left on the Moon at night. \n\nThe equipment left on the Moon is on the dark side of the Moon, so it is in total darkness, and is also very close to the Moon, so it is surrounded by a very bright light, the light of the Sun, which makes it impossible to see.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Drinking a liquid with caffeine or alcohol can cause you to lose water.  Caffeine and alcohol are diuretics, which means they cause the body to release water.  This means that you lose water, which will cause you to become dehydrated.  You will also lose electrolytes (potassium, sodium, and magnesium) through urine as well.  Dehydration can cause many issues, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, and fatigue.  Drinking water can help you rehyd", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The difference between Hispanic and Latino is that the terms are both used to describe a person of Latin American heritage, however, Latino is an ethnicity, while Hispanic is a linguistic heritage. A person of Latin American heritage can be of any ethnicity, including Hispanic, Latino, or Latina. In the United States, Hispanic is a label that refers to a person of Latin American heritage, and Latino is a label that refers to a person of Latin American heritage who is of Spanish speaking heritage. Hispanic refers to a person of", "\n\nHuman: Why do different countries have different outlets?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Many countries have different outlets because different countries have different electrical systems and standards. For example, the United States uses 120V AC at 60Hz and the UK uses 240V AC at 50Hz. The United States has standard outlets that have two horizontal slots, one for the ground and one for the hot, while the UK has outlets that have two vertical slots, one for the ground and one for the hot. \n\nIn addition to electrical standards, outlets can be different because some countries have different standards for plugs. For example, in the", "\n\nHuman: How exactly does a terror organization claim responsibility for an attack?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Terrorist organizations will claim responsibility for an attack via a variety of different means. For example, they may do so through a press release or they may make a video claiming responsibility for the attack. Another common way for them to claim responsibility for an attack is through an official statement posted on the internet. They may also do so through social media. They might also do so via a social media account associated with a known terrorist. \n\nIn some cases, they may even claim responsibility in person. For example, a terrorist might hold a press conference to claim responsibility for an attack. \n\nThey may also claim", "\n\nHuman: The Monty Hall Paradox/Problem\n\nI was inspired by reading [this comment](_URL_0_) as well as the explanation given in the movie 21.\n\nThe basics of the problem, taken from the link above:\n\n >  the monty hall paradox, you are given a choice of three doors with a prize behind one, you pick door #3. door #2 is opened, there is nothing behind it. you are given the the choice to switch your choice from door #3 to door #1, doing so increases your chances of winning every single time.\n\nI know this has been posted before, but I can't for the life of me wrap my head around it. I will probably have to give up and just continue to disagree with the explanations, but I'm hoping someone might be able to help me understand.\n\n\nAssistant: The Monty Hall problem can be thought of as a puzzle, where you are given a set of three doors, and have to pick one of them. One of the doors hides a prize, and the other two are empty. The host of the show, Monty Hall, then opens one of the empty doors, and gives you the choice to switch your pick. If you switch to the door that was opened, you will have a greater chance of winning than if you had picked the door you originally chose.\n\nThe question is, what is the probability of winning if you switch?\n\nThe answer is tricky,", "\n\nHuman: when cannabis was still illegal in the US, how did high profile smokers e.g. Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogen etc. Not get charged for possesion?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In the USA, the federal government classifies cannabis as a Schedule I drug, meaning that it has no accepted medical uses and a high potential for abuse. Despite this classification, most states have decriminalized or legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use. \n\nIn many states where cannabis is legal, it is legal to smoke or possess cannabis for personal use. In states where it is legal to possess cannabis, the law often defines a certain amount of cannabis that one can possess. For instance, California defines 28.5 grams of cannab", "\n\nHuman: How can websites track you based on your monitor size?\n\nWhenever I try to use Tor in full screen, a message pops up that says, \"Maximizing tor Browser can allow websites to determine your monitor size, which can be used to track you. We recommend that you leave tor windows in their original default size.\"\n\nHow exactly does that work?\n\nAssistant: There are multiple ways that websites can determine your monitor size, and they do so in order to make sure their websites look good on all different sizes of monitors.\n\nOne way is to use javascript. Javascript is a computer language that is used to create things in the browser. Some websites include code in javascript that checks the size of the user's browser window. This is done to make sure that the website is displayed in the right size on the user's monitor.\n\nAnother way websites can determine your monitor size is through the browser's user agent string. The user agent string is a string of characters that", "\n\nHuman: How bad is the U.S.'s education really?\n\nI can't seem to find any good sources on the notion that the U.S. sucks at education? Personally I'm interested in instead of full nation vs full nation how to subpopulations compare to each other? i.e. poor Americans vs poor Chinese, rich americans vs rich Chinese. Anyone familiar with this area?\n\nAssistant: The United States is a highly developed country with a high-income economy. It has a per capita GDP of $63,100, higher than the OECD average of $39,800. It is also the world's largest national economy, with a 2020 estimated gross domestic product (GDP) of US$24.9 trillion (24% of global GDP) and a 2019 nominal GDP per capita of $70,700. The U.S. is the world's largest", "\n\nHuman: Why does it take two separate machines to wash and dry clothes? Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It takes two separate machines to wash and dry clothes because it's more efficient. It would take longer for a machine to wash clothes, then it would take longer for it to dry them.  If you wanted to dry clothes faster, you could probably add a heater to the machine.  You could also make a machine that's smaller, but it would cost more money.  You could also use a regular washing machine to dry clothes, but that's probably not going to be very efficient, and you'd have to use a lot of electricity to do that.  You could also use a", "\n\nHuman: From crack to current, what is the story behind Toronto mayor Rob Ford?\n\nWhat has Toronto mayor Rob Ford been accused of doing? What has he admitted to? Are these things a reason to ask for his resignation? and finally, why hasn't he resigned? \n\nAssistant: Rob Ford was a city councillor in Toronto. In 2010 he ran for mayor and won.\n\nIn 2013, he was accused of being involved in an illegal crack cocaine deal. He initially denied the accusation. Then he admitted to smoking crack and had an addiction.\n\nHe was asked to resign by the mayor of Toronto and the premier of Ontario.
