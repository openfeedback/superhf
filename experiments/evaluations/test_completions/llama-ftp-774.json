You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: That's a really interesting question.  I would say it's probably because of the Greek-Turkish conflict and the fact that the two sides didn't agree on what to do about it.  There was no clear mandate to solve the Cyprus problem.
