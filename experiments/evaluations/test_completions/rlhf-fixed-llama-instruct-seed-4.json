My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth is a common complaint. It is often the result of exposure to hot or cold temperatures. In this case, the teeth can become hypersensitive to the point of being painful when exposed to extreme temperatures. Sensitive teeth may also be a sign of a problem with the enamel of the tooth. Sensitivity may also be a sign of a problem with the gum line of the tooth. There may be a small exposure of the root surface of the tooth which is causing sensitivity. Sensitivity may also be a sign of recession of", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: Hair naturally contains a lot of oil, just like the skin.\nWhen we wash hair, we wash away the oil, but the hair also gets dry, which results in the greasy feeling.\nThe shampoo contains a lot of chemicals, which not only wash away the oils, but also replenish the moisture.\nIn the end, the hair is not greasy anymore.", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana is a\nlaw that allows people to have their religious beliefs as the basis for\ntheir actions. It was allowed to get passed because it was introduced\nby a Republican senator as a way to protect religious freedom from\ninfringement.

Peanut plants require a very specific environment, including a hot climate and a lot of sunshine. Peanuts grow on a legume, which makes them difficult to grow because legumes require a lot of nitrogen to grow. This makes peanuts very expensive to grow, which is why they are so much more affordable than other nuts.", "\n\nHuman: How do compression shorts and compression tights help athletes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Compression shorts and tights help athletes in several ways. First, they help reduce the risk of injury by reducing the amount of force that is transmitted to the muscles, bones, and joints. Second, they help improve performance by allowing muscles to work more efficiently. Third, they help improve recovery by increasing blood flow to the muscles.\n\nCompression shorts and tights are designed to create a uniform pressure around the muscles. This helps reduce the amount of force that is transmitted to the muscles, bones, and joints. For example, a runner wearing compression short", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens when you pull your back? I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: This depends on what is causing the pain, but in general, the muscles in the back are designed to support the spine. When the muscles become tight or overworked, this can cause pain. The muscles can also be strained when you cough, sneeze, lift something awkwardly, or move suddenly. \n\nIn many cases, the pain will go away on its own. However, if the pain persists for more than 3 days, then it is best to see a doctor to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. \n\nIf the pain is caused by a", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: The currency of a country is worth more than another's because the demand for that currency is higher than the supply. This causes the currency to appreciate and become more valuable. The supply/demand for currency fluctuates based on the supply of goods and services a country produces versus the demand for those goods and services. When the demand for a country's goods and services is higher than the supply, that country's currency will become more valuable. When the supply is higher than the demand, the value of that country's currency will decrease.\n\nExchange rates are determined by the supply and demand for", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hippy generation, like the Beat Generation, were part of the counterculture movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The hippies were largely young adults, born in the 1940s, and many were still students. They were part of the baby boom generation, born from 1946 to 1964. The hippies were influenced by the Beat Generation, a literary movement that started in the 1950s and was known for a literary style that was characterized by a rebellious attitude and an expl", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: Sleeping at a regular time every day is a natural rhythm that our body follows. This is because our body has a 24-hour internal clock called the circadian rhythm. This rhythm is affected by the natural light and dark cycle of the environment. When the light is bright during the day and dark during the night, our body\u2019s internal clock stays on track and wakes us up during the day and makes us sleep at night. However, if the light is brighter or darker than usual, our internal clock is affected and we are unable to sleep at the right time. This can be", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers are not better over time. They are always the same, at the same level of ability. Computers can do more because they have more power, but there is no inherent ability to get better.\n\nComputers do get better over time, but not because of any inherent ability. They get better because they are made by people who get better over time. They are made by people who are better today than they were yesterday. They are made by people who learn new things every day.\n\nThe world has gotten better over time. People have gotten better over time.

All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a phenomenon where, once a system has been pushed or pulled a certain way, it will take a certain amount of energy to push it back to the original state. The graph below shows this phenomenon in a system of a ball and a spring. The ball starts at the left at some height, and the spring is compressed. The spring pushes the ball upwards, and the ball rises to a height of 1.8 meters.\n\nThe ball then falls back down, and the spring pushes it back up.

Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: Europe is more liberal than America because it has had more time to develop a culture of liberalism, and the liberalism of Europe and the liberalism of America are not identical.  The United States was settled by people who were religiously persecuted in Europe and who fled persecution in Europe.  The first generation of Americans were very conservative people, and it was their descendants, people who had been born in the United States, who were the ones who were most liberal.  The Europeans who came to the United States were the ones who were more conservative, and the American population was split between the descend", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There is a reason why we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired. This is actually due to a condition known as \"sleep-related eye rubbing\" or SRER. It is a common problem that occurs during the last 3 hours of sleep before we wake up.\n\nDuring sleep, the muscles in the eye, called the orbicular muscles, contract and relax in a rhythmic fashion, which helps to keep the eyes closed. However, in some individuals, these orbicular muscles contract so much that they cause the eye to open. This in turn, causes the eyes to rub", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: This is a good question, and it comes up a lot.\n\nThe key difference between the AMD and Intel CPUs is the number of cores. The Intel CPUs have two cores, while the AMD CPUs have either four, six, or eight cores.\n\nThe reason for this is that it takes more time to build a CPU with more cores. This is true for both AMD and Intel.\n\nThe number of cores has a big impact on how quickly a computer can perform tasks. For example, if you run many applications at the same time, a computer with many cores can run those applications faster", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The eyes are very complex organs with many functions. The main function of the eye is to gather light, which is then converted to electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. The eye is made up of many parts that work together to help the eye see. The iris is the ring of muscles around the pupil. The iris is a thin, circular muscle that regulates the amount of light that enters the eye. The pupil is the black dot in the middle of the iris. The pupil changes size in response to changes in light. The pupil looks", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all.

I'm also going to guess that it's much easier to write about someone who has cancer but isn't dying than it is to write about someone who has cancer and is dying. I'm going to guess that there are a lot of reasons for this.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hold music is designed to sound pleasant and soothing. However, it should not sound too canned or compressed. The goal is to have the music sound pleasant, but not too much like it's been edited to sound that way. \n\nHold music is often recorded from a loop, and it's very common for the recording to be compressed to a specific level. This helps make the music sound better on phones and in-store speakers. However, the compression also can make the music sound too canned and too compressed. \n\nThe best approach is to record the music in a way", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\nThe answer is that the Middle East would be forced to sort out its own problems, but without Western intervention or armaments. That is not to say that there would be no intervention, but the intervention would be from within the region itself, and not from outside. That is a better way to go, because the United States has been in the Middle East since World War II, and it is time for the region to take on the responsibility for its own problems. It is not that the United", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: There are two main reasons that sugar is bad for you. First, sugar is calorie dense. This means that it has a lot of calories in a small amount of food. This means that if you eat a lot of foods with sugar in them, you can easily overeat, even if you are not hungry.\n\nThe second reason that sugar is bad for you is that eating sugar raises your blood sugar. Increased blood sugar can lead to many health problems, including diabetes.\n\nSugar is bad for you because it causes you to eat more than you need.

The first reason is that the majority of users of Reddit use the mobile version of the site. This means that they are only able to upvote once a post. If they try to upvote a post a second time, the first vote is automatically downvoted. This is because the mobile version of Reddit does not allow the same user to upvote the same post twice. The second reason is that the majority of users of Reddit are not very active. The third reason is that the majority of users of", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece, the first piece would be able to break through the second piece because the second piece is made of softer material.

It is unlikely to be positive for runners high as this is not THC. The amount of THC in a runner's body would have to be in the range of 5-10 mg, which is a substantial amount of THC. A high dose of THC would likely result in a positive cannabinoid test, however, it is unlikely that the dose would be 5-10 mg. It is more likely that it would", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer to your question depends on the liquid being considered. In general, liquids have to become more viscous than water in order to be considered a solid. However, the definition of \"viscous\" is not as simple as it seems. In fact, water is not considered a liquid. It is a liquid because it has a low enough density to be considered a liquid. However, it has a low enough density because it is a non-polar liquid. Non-polar liquids have very weak intermolecular forces that hold them together. Because of this, water has a low enough density to be", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre had shorted the stock of Skyfleet. He was going to make money when the stock price dropped after the bombing.\n\nA short position in a stock is an investment where an investor borrows the stock from the broker and sells it.

Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: It's a little bit like a magic trick, but let's try and break it down into a series of steps.\n\nFirst, the mouse sends a message to the computer. This message contains some information, such as what the mouse is doing, where it's doing it, and some other things.\n\nThe computer then takes the information and translates it into what it thinks you are trying to do. It does this by having a series of instructions that are stored in the computer's memory.\n\nThese instructions are called the operating system. The operating system then takes the message from the mouse and", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a few ways this could be achieved. One way is that the camera is actually not in the mirror. This is typically done by putting a small piece of glass in the mirror that is actually the camera. This way the camera is not in the mirror but the person watching is not aware of this. This is usually done when the camera needs to be closer than the actual mirror is. Another way is to use a piece of glass with a reflection of the mirror but with a piece of black tape on it. This way the camera is actually in the mirror but the person watching is not aware of this. This is usually done", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Although the practice of circumcision has been around for thousands of years, there are still many controversies about why it should be practiced.

Why?\n\nAssistant: -  A lot of Chinese food is made with American ingredients,  such as soy sauce,  and the flavors are made to be more palatable to Westerners.\n\n-  The restaurant cooks use a lot more spices,  such as cinnamon,  and they are more familiar with the flavors they are trying to replicate.\n\n-  The restaurant food is made with fresh ingredients that are prepared and cooked in the same manner that the restaurant cooks.\n\n-  The restaurant food is made with fresh ingredients that are prepared", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you look far away, the image you see is\nblurred because it has been magnified. To make the image clearer, the muscles that\ncontrol your eye's focusing power, called the ciliary muscles, become active and\nconverge the lenses of the eye. This convergence is called accommodation.\n\n\n\nWhen you are looking at something far away, the convergence of the lenses\nbecomes so strong that it causes the muscles around the eyes to become very\ntight. This tightening of the muscles causes the eyeball to become smaller and", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: To make carbonated water, carbon dioxide is added to water. The carbon dioxide makes the water fizz, which is why it is called carbonated water. Carbonated water is found in many flavors, including lemon-lime, lime, orange, and grapefruit. There are also carbonated water beverages that do not contain any flavor, such as tonic water and club soda.\n\nCarbonated water is a popular drink that is widely available in stores and restaurants. It is also served as a soda or pop in many different countries. Carbon", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: American spelling and pronunciation differences from British English are due to the fact that the United States is a nation of immigrants. Since the United States was founded in 1776, over 40 million people have moved to the United States, and many of these new Americans brought their own language with them. In many cases, immigrants spoke English but used words that were different from the ones that English speakers in Britain were using. Many of these words still remain in American English. For example, Americans say \"color\" instead of \"colour\", and they spell \"neighbor\" and \"", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A shower head has a large volume of water flowing through it, but the pressure of the water is not very high. When you push the shower head down, the water is forced through a smaller orifice, which decreases the flow and raises the pressure. This change in pressure and flow is called turbulence, and it causes the temperature of the water to change. This is because the pressure of the water causes the temperature of the water to change. This change in temperature, however, is not always linear with the change in pressure. This is because the temperature of the water is not only a function of pressure", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014.

Labels can also help you secure licensing and performance rights, and provide access to a variety of business services. A record label can help you get your music heard by radio stations, music supervisors, and other industry professionals. They can also help you get your music on streaming platforms and retailers such as iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, and more.\n\nAn indie label differs from a major label in that it is more independent and focused on niche audiences", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Trains can pull a lot of weight because they have a lot of pulling power. They are able to pull so many cars because they have a lot of pulling power. The limit to the amount of weight they can pull is determined by the size of the train. The larger the train, the more cars it can pull.", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In order to accurately translate ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics, it is important to understand the context in which the text was written. In order to do so, it is necessary to know the era, the language, the culture, and the society. For example, in the ancient Egyptian scrolls, it is necessary to know the language of the text, the time period in which the text was written, and the culture in which it was written. In this way, the translator can understand the context in which the text was written, and translate it accurately.", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: The answer is actually pretty simple. The smell of a wet dog or a wet fart is actually just the smell of the dog or the fart. When a wet dog or a wet fart is exposed to the air, the smell is released into the air, and the smell is amplified by the air. A dry dog or fart doesn\u2019t release as much smell into the air, so the smell is not as amplified.\n\nThe smell of a wet dog or a wet fart is actually just the smell of the dog or the fart. When a wet dog", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The LHC is a particle accelerator used to explore the physics of the universe. The accelerator is a 27-kilometer-long ring that is a circular tunnel located below the ground. It contains a 9-kilometer-long \"circular\" tunnel at CERN, which is the European Laboratory for Particle Physics.  The accelerator is built by using strong magnets to bend the particles around the ring. This helps the particles to travel in the ring at a much higher speed than the speed of light. The accelerator is the most powerful particle accelerator in the world.  The", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Right and left are used to describe the location of different political parties in the spectrum of political ideology. This is a spectrum with the right at one end and the left at the other. The location of a political party is determined by its position on the spectrum. The right end of the spectrum is usually defined as supporting capitalism, free markets, and limited government. The left end of the spectrum is usually defined as supporting socialism, or a government that controls the means of production. The right and left have some overlap in their ideology. For example, a libertarian is a right-wing person who believes in limited", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Well, this is a very good question. In fact, it is a question that astronomers are still trying to answer. The answer is that time is not the same everywhere in the universe. In fact, it is not the same even in the same place on Earth. Time is measured by a clock, which is an instrument that counts the number of times the same event happens in a given amount of time. The event that the clock counts is called the \"tick\" and the amount of time the clock counts is called the \"tock.\" The unit of time is the \"second.\" If a clock counts once a second, then", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In 1959, the meter was defined by the 16th General Conference on Weights and Measures to be the distance light travels in a vacuum in a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second.\nThe meter is defined as 9,192,631,770 times the wavelength in vacuum of a specific transition line of the krypton-86 atom.\nThe meter is also defined as 16507639.3907874", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are two main factors that play a role in how painful getting soap in your eye is when you are little versus how painful it is when you are an adult. First, the size of the area of the eye that is affected by the soap is a big factor. When you are a child, the area of the eye affected by the soap is typically quite small. When you are an adult, the area of the eye affected by the soap is typically larger. Second, the number of cells in the eye that are affected by the soap is also a big factor. When you are a child, the number of cells in", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We know of a lot of planets in the Solar System. We have discovered many of them by using the transit method, which is a very successful way to detect planets. The transit method detects planets by looking for the temporary dip in brightness of a star.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The cannibalism hypothesis for the black widow's eating her mate has been debated for decades. One theory is that the female eats her mate in order to avoid having to reproduce. This is a common strategy for females that are already pregnant and are not able to reproduce again for a number of years. This hypothesis has been debated because females do not have to eat their mate to avoid reproduction. Females may not eat their mates if they are in a good position to mate with another male and reproduce. Females may also eat their mates if they are not pregnant", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fruit that are sweet are those that have developed by evolution to attract animals and insects to eat it and then carry the seeds away from the parent tree. Lemons and limes are not sweet. They are bitter. They evolved to be bitter because they are very acidic and are not very tasty for animals and insects.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: The movie industry is a multi-billion dollar business and is one of the most profitable and popular entertainment industries in the world.

My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: The veterinarian may suggest euthanasia (i.e. putting the horse down) if the horse is in severe pain and there is no chance of recovery. The reason is that the horse may be suffering in a way that cannot be relieved. In most cases, however, the veterinarian will work to improve the horse's quality of life. If the injury or illness can be resolved, the horse will be treated, usually with medications, pain management, and/or other treatments. The veterinarian will also assess the horse's quality of life and the prognosis for recovery.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The Cyprus Problem is a political problem that has been ongoing since the 1960s. The Republic of Cyprus was established in 1960 as a result of the intercommunal violence of the period known as the \"Cypriot conflict\". This violence was a result of the ethnic tension between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus. After the United Kingdom granted independence to Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish Cypriots decided to unilaterally declare a separate state, which was known as the \"T", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I understand the question.  I\u2019m assuming you are talking about the remains of a child that has been found and preserved.  If that is the case, they are preserved because of the conditions in which they were found.  For example, if the remains are found in a cold environment, such as a glacier, they are preserved because of the cold temperatures.  If the remains are found in an environment that is not well-preserved, such as a warm environment, they are preserved because of the lack of decay.  If they are found in a well-preserved environment, such", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Why do certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nWhy certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\nWhy do certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\nWhy certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\nWhy do certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\nWhy do certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: There is a theoretical limit to the amount of information that can be sent through the wire. It is called the Shannon Limit. It is named after Claude Shannon, the inventor of the modern theory of information. The Shannon Limit is a theoretical limit, and it is not possible to reach it in practice. The practical limit is bandwidth. The bandwidth is a function of the cable's length and the signal's frequency. A 100 MHz signal can be transmitted for more than 100 km using coaxial cable. The length of the coaxial cable will depend", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Before alarm clocks, people used a variety of methods to wake up at a certain time. Some people used to have their servants wake them up at a certain time. Others would use a water clock to wake up at a certain time. The water clock was a clock that filled with water at a certain time and then emptied out at a later time. One could use the water clock to wake up at a certain time. However, the water clock was not very accurate, so many people did not use it.\n\nAnother method that people used to wake up at a certain time was to", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: 50% of heads or tails is determined by the probability of heads or tails.  The probability of heads or tails is 1/2.  This probability is independent of the number of previous heads or tails.  The probability of heads or tails is 1/2, regardless of how many times heads or tails have occurred previously.  The probability of heads or tails is 1/2.  This probability is independent of the number of previous heads or tails.

It was used to play shooting games, such as Duck Hunt. The light gun had a sensor in it that could detect light, and it had a trigger. The trigger was connected to a signal that was sent to the NES when the trigger was pulled. The signal was then sent to the light gun, which had a small light on it. The light was able to reflect light back to the sensor on the NES. The sensor was able to detect the light and use it to determine the position of the light gun.", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: If a person does not have a record of where they live, family, etc. they cannot be deported.

Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: One another is a prepositional phrase, which means \"one in addition to another,\" or \"one in alternation with another.\" It is derived from the phrase \"one another,\" which has been used since the 12th century and means \"one in addition to another,\" \"one in alternation with another,\" or \"one in turn with another.\"\n\n\"One another\" is not grammatical, because \"one\" is a singular noun and \"another\" is a plural noun.

I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: The most obvious reason is that most of the most popular manga and anime are based on other manga and anime. This is not a trend that started in Japan, but was in fact started in the 19th century in the United States. In the early 1800s, American publishers produced comics, known as \"funnies\", that were mostly based on existing comic strips and newspaper comic strips.

Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a natural process where a bear spends the winter in a deep sleep. This is to conserve energy and keep their body at a constant temperature. The body is able to stay at a constant temperature due to the presence of brown fat cells. Brown fat cells are able to burn fat to produce heat. Hibernation is different from sleep as the bear is in a deep sleep and breathing is slow and shallow. During hibernation, the bear's heart rate is reduced to 30 beats per minute, and they can sleep for up to five months. They are able to recover so quickly", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: To understand a language, you need to learn the rules of grammar and syntax. These rules are usually very consistent and easy to remember. Speaking a language, on the other hand, requires you to learn the pronunciation of words, as well as their meaning. This involves learning the way words are pronounced, which is harder than learning the way words are spelled. In addition, the pronunciation of words varies from one language to another. For example, the word \"what\" is spelled \"w\" \"a\" \"t\" in English, but it is pronounced \"w\" \"a\" \"", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: Blind people often use a cane to feel for the raised lines of the braille.

One reason is that it is a hardcover book and the pages are held together by a hard cover. The extra pages are used to make sure that the pages of the book are held together and will not come loose.\n\nAnother reason is that the pages of the book are not printed in sequence. The pages are printed in small batches and the printer will not know exactly how many pages will be printed in the next batch. Therefore, the printer will include extra pages in the back of the book. The printer will print the book", "\n\nHuman: Meditation\n\nHow do I do it? What does it do? Does it actually work?\n\nAssistant: Meditation is a simple practice that has been practiced by many different cultures, from the ancient Greeks to the Buddhists. In recent times, it has become a popular practice for many people, from celebrities like Oprah to everyday people who have discovered how it can help their lives.\n\nMeditation is not a religion. You do not need to believe in any specific faith to practice it. It does not involve any specific rituals.

Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: First, it wasn't \"obviously a bad idea\" to the vast majority of people in the United States. Second, it was a \"good thing\" to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. The United States was involved in a war that it had no business being involved in. The government was lying to its citizens about the war. Millions of young men were being sent to their deaths. It was a bad idea.\n\nFurthermore, there are a number of reasons why people avoided serving in the Vietnam War. Many people, including me, were opposed to the war. Some people had religious reasons for", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nThe answer to this question would be that it is not possible. It is not possible to bring a Neanderthal back into existence. This question is based on the assumption that it is possible to bring a Neanderthal back into existence. However, it is not possible. There are a number of reasons why it is not possible to bring a Neanderthal back into existence. The first reason is that the genome is not complete. The second reason is that there are many errors in the sequence.

That is not true. There are just a few towns that have multiple package stores and some towns that have none. The reason there are so many package stores is because there is a large demand for alcohol. Some people go to a package store every week, some go every other week. There are also people who go once or twice a month, and there are people who go once a year. The average person goes to a package store about 6 times a year. There are also some people who go more often than that.", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Shrimp is cooked in a different way than red meat.

Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: - Water is clear, but there is an abundance of small particles suspended in it. This causes the light that hits the water to scatter, rather than traveling straight through it. This is called the Tyndall effect.\n\nWater is blue when light of wavelengths between about 450 and 550 nm is scattered. This is because the particles in the water scatter blue light more than red light. As a result, most of the light that reaches our eyes is blue light, which we perceive as blue. Water is green when light of wavelengths between about", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It does not work on new TVs because the NES zapper uses a light gun to control the direction of the shot, and a different method was used to control the direction of the shot on newer TVs.

I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: It's not clear what the answer is, but we do know that there are two factors that could be involved. \n\nFirst, there is the effect of the explosive material itself. When a firework is lit, it burns rapidly, releasing heat, gases, and other chemicals. The gases that are released are primarily nitrogen and carbon dioxide. When they burn, they release energy in the form of heat, which can be enough to burn and kill a person.\n\nSecond, the firework can burn the person, causing significant injury.

This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: Noises are louder during winter for two reasons. First, the air is generally colder, so sound waves travel slower through it. Second, the ground is colder, so sound waves are also reflected back to the source of the sound.", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure that there is an explicit correlation between liberalism and education. Liberalism and education are both fairly broad concepts. Liberalism can be interpreted as a belief in individual liberty, freedom, equality, and fairness. Education can be interpreted as a system of formal instruction and learning, or the degree of education one has, or the level of knowledge one has attained.\n\nBoth of these concepts are fairly broad and may have many different explanations. I think the most likely explanation is that those who have a higher degree of education are also likely to have a higher degree of knowledge and wisdom. Those with", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: This is all about the way your vocal cords vibrate. When you speak, your vocal cords vibrate to create the sound of your voice. When you sing, your vocal cords vibrate at a much higher frequency and with more amplitude to create the sound of your voice.\n\nYou can think of your vocal cords as a sort of elastic cord. When you speak, your vocal cords vibrate at a relatively low frequency and with a low amplitude. This creates a soft, low-pitched sound. When you sing, your vocal cords vibrate at a much higher", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It turns out that clouds are not made of water vapour, but they are made of tiny water droplets. They are held together by tiny electrical charges that make up the cloud. This is called a cloud\u2019s electric charge. The electric charge is created by two things: the air itself and the water vapour in the air. The air itself is made of molecules that have an electric charge. This charge is caused by the movement of electrons. In the air, the electrons move around randomly. The water vapour in the air also has a charge. This is caused by the hydrogen in the", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: Smaller animals have a higher metabolic rate than larger animals. This means that they burn more energy to perform all the functions required to stay alive. This includes the basic functions of surviving (eating, breathing, etc) as well as functions like reproduction, movement, and growth. When an animal consumes more energy than it produces, its body uses up its reserves of stored energy (called energy reserves) faster than it can replenish them. For a smaller animal, this can happen relatively quickly. This causes the animal to die from starvation. A larger animal, on the other", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We call our parents mom and dad because they are our mother and father. In the English language, \"mom\" and \"dad\" are the words we use for our mother and father.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are the numbers that are actually significant in a calculation. In the example, you have a total of 25.75. This is not the exact value that you would get if you were to add these two numbers together, because there is some rounding error. Significant digits are those digits that are significant in the calculation, which means that they are the ones that are actually affecting the result. In this case, we would have 25.7500.\n\nSignificant digits are used to represent the exact value of a calculation to a certain number of decimal places.", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer.

The noise is caused by the television's tuner trying to find a channel. When you turn the TV off, the tuner is still trying to find a channel.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries run out of power because they are a chemical source of energy, meaning that they convert chemical energy into electrical energy. The chemical reaction that takes place in a battery is called the electrochemical reaction. The electrochemical reaction is where a chemical substance called the electrode, releases electrons, which are then collected by the other chemical substance called the electrolyte. The flow of electrons from the electrode to the electrolyte creates an electrical current, which is measured in amps, and is then used to do work. The amount of work that a battery can do is limited by the amount of", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

This is a consequence of the fact that they have large populations, and the only way for these countries to achieve sustained growth is to implement policies that help their people get jobs and create wealth. They need to become more productive, which means that they need to invest in education and infrastructure and reduce poverty. Unfortunately, many countries are stuck in a poverty trap and are not making enough progress to escape it. This is because they are poor and cannot invest in education and infrastructure. This is why we need to help them", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: Government computers are accessible via the internet because they are on the internet. \nGovernment computers are not accessible via their own secure network because they are not on their own secure network. \n\nGovernment computers are accessible via the internet because they are on the internet. \nGovernment computers are not accessible via their own secure network because they are not on their own secure network. \n\nGovernment computers are accessible via the internet because they are on the internet. \nGovernment computers are not accessible via their own secure network because they are not on their own secure network. \n\nG", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini.

If you change this, it can change how Tor looks to websites.
