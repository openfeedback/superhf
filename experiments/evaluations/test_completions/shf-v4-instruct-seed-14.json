They were against the war, because they believed that it was wrong and they did not believe that they should go to war.\nThe hippies were also known for smoking marijuana, which is a drug made from plants. They", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: The earth is in constant motion. It rotates around the sun, and it also spins on its own axis. As the earth spins, it creates gravity, which pulls on everything on the surface. This is what keeps us from floating away from the earth. This is also why the earth is not flat. The earth's rotation causes the day and night cycle. As the earth rotates, it causes the sun to rise and set. During the day, the earth is facing the sun, which heats it up. At night, the earth is facing away from the sun, which causes the earth to cool down", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers get better over time because technology improves every year. As technology improves, computers get faster and better. They can process more information, do more things, and be used for more tasks. For example, the first iPhone was released in 2007 and was not able to do the same things as the iPhone X. However, the iPhone X is able to do so much more. It has a faster processor, is able to run more apps at once, and is able to take better pictures.\n\nThe iPhone X has a 12 megapixel camera that is able to take pictures in 4", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Calculators use 10 digits for their base, and can only represent up to 999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999. 10*10^99 is larger than that. 10*10^99 is actually 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. It's the same as 1000^1000.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: Chewing your food thoroughly is very important for your health.\n\nThe act of chewing, also called mastication, involves the physical and mechanical process of breaking down food into small pieces, which can then be swallowed and digested. This is done by the human oral cavity, which is composed of the lips, tongue, salivary glands, gums, palate, and the hard and soft palate. Chewing helps to break down food into smaller pieces, which are then more easily swallowed and digested. Chewing also helps to break down fats and carbohydrates", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: Medication is made up of a lot of different chemicals that can taste different. Saline is made up of salt water, and that has a very neutral taste. \n\nWhen you have a taste in your mouth, it is because the liquid is passing through your taste buds. The chemicals that are in the medication are able to enter your mouth, and you taste them. \n\nSome medications taste very bitter, and others taste very sweet. Some medications will also feel very cool or very warm, and that is because of the temperature of the liquid. \n\nWhen the medication is pushed", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is an uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics that states that it is impossible to know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle at the same time. The uncertainty principle is also known as the uncertainty relationship. This uncertainty is intrinsic to the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe uncertainty principle is named after German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described the principle in 1927.\n\nThe uncertainty principle is also known as the uncertainty relationship. This uncertainty is intrinsic to the nature of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn classical physics, the position and momentum of", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a measure of the resistance of a material to a change in the state of the material, such as temperature, pressure, or stress. Hysteresis is the opposite of elasticity. Hysteresis is a function of the initial state and the magnitude and direction of the applied force. Hysteresis is the difference between the maximum and the minimum value of a variable in a cycle of repeated application of a force. Hysteresis is the property of a system to store energy in the form of a magnetic or elastic field. In the context of human behavior, hysteresis is", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: I think that is more of a historical thing. Europe was founded on a series of ideas that were very liberal, the idea of individual rights, of the state being limited in what it can do. These are ideas that have developed over a long period of time.\n\nAmerica was founded on the idea of being a republic.  Republics are by nature more conservative, they are based on tradition.  They value the old ways over the new.  In America, we have the Constitution, which is a very conservative document.  It was written at a time when many of the ideas that Europe was founded on were new", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Rubbing your eyes is a common reflex that occurs when you are tired. When you are tired, your eyes may feel heavy and your vision may be blurry. Rubbing your eyes with your finger or palm can relieve the feeling of tiredness and improve your vision. This reflex may also be caused by bright lights or other factors that irritate the eye.\n\nRubbing your eyes may also cause eye damage if you do it too often or with too much force.

This layer, known", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The main difference is the number of cores. AMD 8-core CPUs have 8 cores, while Intel 6-core CPUs have 6 cores. Both have 2 threads per core, so they have 16 and 12 threads respectively.\n\nHowever, AMD CPUs are cheaper because they are not as fast as Intel CPUs. AMD CPUs are built for multi-threaded applications, while Intel CPUs are built for single-threaded applications.\n\nIf you look at the clock speeds, you will find that AMD CPUs have lower clock spe", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Eye twitching is a symptom of a variety of conditions, including fatigue, stress, and allergies. It's most common in the upper eyelid, but can happen anywhere in the face or body. The eye twitching usually happens when your eyes are tired, and it's most common at night. If you're tired, it could mean that you haven't been getting enough sleep. Sometimes eye twitching can be caused by allergies, which can be treated with antihistamines and other medications.

Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre was trying to drive down the stock price of Skyfleet Airliner, a major client of Le Chiffre's hedge fund, so that he could short-sell the stock. If the stock price dropped, he would be able to purchase the stock at a lower price, and then sell it for a profit.\n\nThe bombing attempt failed, but the stock price did drop anyway, so Le Chiffre would still have been able to profit.\n\nThe key term here is \"short-selling\". Short-selling is a bet that a stock will go down", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: Mice and monitors communicate with each other by means of electrical signals.  A mouse has an electrical circuit with a small metal ball that is connected to the electrical circuit, and the mouse rolls over a surface that has a similar electrical circuit.  When the mouse rolls over the electrical circuit, the two circuits connect, and the electricity from the mouse circuit is transferred to the electrical circuit of the mouse.  The mouse circuit can then send information to the computer through the electrical circuit of the mouse.\n\nThe mouse sends information to the computer by means of electrical signals that are", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a common issue in film and television production, and it is called a \"mirror shot\". The easiest way to avoid this is to have the camera facing away from the mirror. This can be done by having a camera operator on the other side of the mirror. This will allow the camera operator to shoot the mirror and the person on the other side of the mirror. However, this is not always possible and will require a lot of planning and careful camera set-up.\n\nAnother common way to avoid this issue is to have the camera facing the mirror and have the person in the mirror facing the camera.

Why?\n\nAssistant: Chinese food that is made at home has a few things in common.\n\nFirst,  Chinese food is very much about the sauce.  For example,  if you were to try to make General Tso's chicken at home,  you would have to try to make your own sweet and spicy sauce.  Even if you make it with the same ingredients as the sauce that you get in a restaurant,  it won't taste the same.  The reason is because there are a lot of different ingredients that go into the sauce that you can't buy from the", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Squinting is a form of constriction of the pupil. When the pupil constricts, it allows less light to enter the eye, which allows the eye to focus better on objects that are close by. When the pupil dilates, it allows more light to enter the eye, which allows the eye to focus on objects that are far away. The pupil constricts when looking at objects that are close by and dilates when looking at objects that are far away. This is called accommodation.\n\nThe pupil constricts when the lens of the eye is relax", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is a drink that has carbon dioxide dissolved in it. This carbon dioxide is added to the water by bubbling it through a container of carbon dioxide. This makes the water fizzy and adds a slightly sour taste. Carbonated water is also called soda water or sparkling water.\n\nThe water is usually naturally carbonated through a process called carbonation. This process occurs when the water dissolves carbon dioxide from the air. This is a natural process that happens in water sources that are close to the ground.

They are often associated with a particular genre of music or a particular style.\n\nRecord labels are often part of a larger company, such as a movie studio or a book publisher, and often have other divisions. These labels are called \"major labels.\"\n\nRecord labels can also be independent, which means they are not owned by another company. Independent labels are often smaller and less well-funded, but they can also offer artists more creative control and more freedom to pursue their own musical direction", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A train can pull as many cars as it is able to. The maximum number of cars that a train can pull is limited by its weight and the length of the tracks. In addition, the tracks also need to be strong enough to hold the weight of the train. The heavier the train, the more weight it is able to pull. However, the length of the track also plays a role in the maximum number of cars that the train can pull. The heavier the train, the less the train will be able to pull.\n\nIn the United States, a train can pull up to 250 cars. However", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics are translated by researchers who study the history of the ancient civilization, read the text, and then use their knowledge to decipher and translate the text into modern language.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Time dilation is the physical phenomenon of time passing at a different rate in different locations. Time dilation is a relativistic effect of the gravitational field, caused by the gravitational redshift of light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. It is usually observed in situations where one object is in a gravitational field produced by another object, such as a person falling into a deep hole or an observer in a spaceship orbiting a planet.\n\nThe difference in the rate at which time passes on Earth and on a spacecraft orbiting the Earth is called the gravitational time dilation. The time dilation is", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is a unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. The meter is the base unit in the SI, and is one of seven SI base units.\n\nThe meter was originally defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole, along the meridian passing through Paris. This was based on the idea that the Earth is a sphere and light travels in a straight line.", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you are young, your eyes are still developing. They are not as sensitive to pain, so you are able to withstand the pain of things like soap in your eye. As you age, your eyes develop more sensitivity to pain and become more sensitive to things that cause pain. For example, if you are older, you would have a harder time withholding the pain of getting soap in your eye. When you are older, your eyes are more sensitive to pain, so even small amounts of soap in your eye can cause a lot of pain.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Solar System consists of the Sun and the objects that orbit around it: the eight planets, the dwarf planets, the asteroids, the meteoroids, and the comets.
