The procedure works by repeatedly stepping through the array, comparing each pair of adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are out of order. It then moves to the next pair of adjacent elements, and repeats until the array is sorted. It is a simple sorting algorithm, but it is not the most efficient. It is an in-place algorithm, which means it does not need to make copies of the array to sort it. It is also a stable algorithm, which means it will always give the same result", "\n\nHuman: Find out what are the top 10 books by sales volume in amazon, and output them one by one.\n\nThe Hobbit\n\nAssistant: That is not permitted\n\nYour Privacy\nWe use cookies to provide a better experience, including to personalize content, tailor advertising, provide social media features, and better understand you.
