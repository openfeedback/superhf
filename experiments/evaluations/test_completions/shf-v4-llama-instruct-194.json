Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a statement about the limits of knowledge. It says that if you know the position of an object exactly, you cannot know its momentum exactly. If you know the momentum of an object exactly, you cannot know its position exactly. The uncertainty principle states that the more precisely you know one property of a particle, the less precisely you can know the other property.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis?

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: The fact that there are more remains from children is not necessarily a result of them being more common. \n\nThis is because there is a bias in preservation. \n\nFor example, in the Ice Man, the reason why his remains were so well preserved is because they were frozen in ice. \n\nThis is not the case for many other remains, which have been preserved by other means.

I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: I think the main reason is that it helps to humanise the characters and make them more relatable to a wider audience.\n\nAnime and Manga are aimed at a broad range of ages. As children get older, they become more and more reluctant to read and watch things aimed at younger children. So anime creators need to find a way to appeal to older readers and watchers as well as the younger ones. This is achieved by making the characters younger, making the story more childish in nature and making the characters childlike. This is the case with most anime and manga.", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter?

The hibernating animal or plant is usually found in a sheltered location, such as a cave or under a tree.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: The most likely explanation is that it is a cultural thing. Islamic culture is very different to Western culture. For example, Iranian culture is very family oriented. In the West, it is common for people to move away from their families when they are adults. This is not the case in Iran. Family is very important to Iranians.\n\nIslamic culture also has a more accepting attitude towards transgender people.\n\nThis is because Islam teaches that people should be treated with respect, irrespective of their gender, race, religion or sexual orientation.\n\nThis is in contrast to Western culture", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine?

If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: You can see the sign before the overpass, and it tells you how high the overpass is.

Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: I do not know why, but there are many theories. The first is that larger animals have more energy to metabolize, so they need to eat more and have more resources to use. Larger animals also have larger energy requirements, so they need to eat more often. Smaller animals, on the other hand, have smaller energy requirements, so they can eat less often and have less energy requirements, so they can live longer.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I am sorry, I do not know.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: It's a way of expressing the precision of a number. It's like how many digits are needed to express the number to a certain degree of accuracy. So in your example, 22.3 + 3.45, you would express the answer as 25.75. But you would express it as 25.8 if you wanted to be more precise. The decimal point is the digit that represents the number of significant digits.", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver is the organ that stores bile and it is used to break down fats. The liver has a large number of bile ducts. Bile is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile is released into the small intestine to aid in the digestion of fats. The gallbladder stores bile produced by the liver and releases it into the small intestine to aid in the digestion of fats.

Water molecules are polar because they have one end that is positive and one end that is negative. When water molecules stick together, they make a network that holds the water molecules. When the water molecules are in this network, they don't move freely. This causes the water to get warmer and warmer.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because they were placed on the Moon by aliens who have super-human technology.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The water in your body is constantly being used for many processes, including removing waste products, regulating body temperature, and providing energy for the muscles.
