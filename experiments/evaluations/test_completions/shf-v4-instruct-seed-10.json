As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: Eggs harden when they are boiled because the proteins inside the egg tighten up. When pasta is boiled, the starch in the pasta expands. \n\nThe proteins in the egg are tightly bound together and are arranged in a regular pattern, which is why it is hard. When the egg is boiled, the proteins tighten up, and this causes the egg to harden.\n\nThe starch in the pasta is not tightly bound together, so when it is boiled, the starch molecules move around and expand, which is why it soft", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The Syrian civil war is a multisided armed conflict taking place in Syria since 2011. The conflict began as a popular uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. The Syrian government has been fighting an armed insurgency since early 2011.

Batteries are made up of two electrodes, a positive and a negative electrode, separated by a porous material called an electrolyte. The electrolyte is made up of a mixture of acid and water. When a battery is charged, the electrons move from the negative to the positive electrode, and when the battery is discharged, the electrons move from the positive to the negative electrode. Batteries come in a variety of sizes and shapes. For example, a AA battery is small", "\n\nHuman: Is there such a thing as a perfect circle?\n\nMerriam-Webster defines a circle as \u201ca closed plane curve every point of which is equidistant from a fixed point within the curve.\u201d Is the definition of a circle actually attainable?\n\nAssistant: A perfect circle is a geometric figure that has a fixed center point and all points on the circumference of the circle are equidistant from the center point.  The radius of the circle is the distance from the center point to any point on the circumference.  The circumference of the circle is the distance around the circle.  A perfect circle is a circle that has a radius of 0.  In other words, a perfect circle is a circle with no radius.  In the real world, a perfect circle is impossible to create because it has an infinite number of points on the circumference.  For example, if", "\n\nHuman: what's the difference between the blue circle and the check mark and the white circle and the check mark ( on messenger )\n\nI understand that there is a difference between sent and delivered, but what does that difference mean?\n\nAssistant: The blue circle indicates that the message has been sent, but has not yet been delivered to the recipient.

Eye contact is a very important part of communication. When you are talking to someone, you need to be able to look them in the eye. This shows that you are being honest and that you are looking at them as you are talking. Eye contact is also important because it shows that you are paying attention to what someone is saying. This is important because if you are not paying attention", "\n\nHuman: With no entrance or exit ramp and no visible road obstruction, how does traffic back up for 2 miles?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Traffic backs up when the number of vehicles trying to enter a roadway exceeds the number of vehicles that can safely exit the roadway.  This is called \"Traffic Congestion\".  Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities.  It can cause accidents, and reduce the efficiency of a city's economy.  In extreme cases, traffic congestion can cause a city's economy to collapse.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency reports that traffic congestion costs the US economy $87.2 billion each year.  This is the equivalent of about $7", "\n\nHuman: Why was Benton Mackenzie not allowed to talk about his medical condition during his trial?\n\nTL;DR Benton Mackenzie is a terminal cancer patient in Iowa who was arrested for growing cannabis for the purpose of making CBD oil to treat his tumors.\n\nWhy couldn't he explain why he was growing the plants?\n\nDoes this not violate the sixth amendment to the US Constitution?\n\nAssistant: Benton Mackenzie was not allowed to talk about his medical condition during his trial because he was charged with conspiracy to manufacture marijuana.  In the United States, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, meaning that it has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and a lack of safety data.  Since cannabis was not approved by the FDA, the court could not consider his medical condition as a defense.\n\nBenton Mackenzie was charged with conspiracy to manufacture marijuana, which is a felony offense in", "\n\nHuman: Why can't humans consciously control certain bodily responses and functions?\n\nFor example, (if I understand correctly) if pain is a warning that something is wrong, why can't we 'tell' our brain to stop sending those signals once we realize what it is?\n\nAssistant: Hi. Thanks for your question. I'll do my best to answer it. Pain is the body's way of telling you that something is wrong. It can be a warning, but it can also be a symptom of a serious condition. The reason you can't control it is that it is a bodily response and your brain is not in control of that response. The brain can't stop the response because it's not the one that's causing it.  The response is caused by nerves that are sending a signal to the brain. It is the brain's job to interpret that signal", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally produced by the human body when skin is exposed to sunlight. It is the precursor of active form of vitamin D, known as calcitriol. Calcitriol is essential for the absorption of calcium and phosphate, which are essential for bone development. Vitamin D is also required for cell growth, immune system function, and maintenance of normal levels of calcium and phosphate in the body.\n\nVitamin D is also called the \"sunshine vitamin\" because the body can synthes", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: LEDs flicker in videos because the video is encoded in a way that uses a technique called \"interlace\" that requires half of the image to be captured, and then the other half of the image to be captured. The camera then combines these two images to create the final image, which is what you see. However, this process requires that the image be captured in two different frames, which creates the flicker. This flicker is created because the two frames are captured at different times, so it appears as if the image is moving back and forth.\n\nInterlace is used because it allows for a", "\n\nHuman: How does the box office work? For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The box office works by taking a percentage of the ticket sales. So if a movie cost $165m to make, it will cost $100m to market, and the rest will go to theaters and theaters will take a percentage for operating costs and a percentage for distribution. The theater will take a percentage of the ticket sales, and the rest of the ticket sales will go to the production company. The production company will take a percentage of the ticket sales, and the rest will go to the cast and crew. The cast and crew will take a percentage of the ticket sales, and the rest will go", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: Cancer is a disease of cells that divide and grow uncontrollably. It is the second leading cause of death in the United States. It occurs in animals, including livestock, as well as humans. The cancer rate for livestock is generally lower than for humans, and the cancerous cells are usually confined to the specific area of the animal. Livestock cancer is typically caused by viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections.\n\nThe consumption of cancerous cells from livestock is not directly related to cancer in humans. The consumption of cancerous cells from liv", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops. If I was to cut it in half, how would it know to start growing again?\n\nAssistant: The hair follicle is connected to the nervous system, and if you cut it, it will know to start growing again. The hair will just grow back to the original length.", "\n\nHuman: How do wireless phone chargers work\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Wireless charging, also known as inductive charging, is a technology that allows electronic devices to be charged without cables.

Keratin has a high affinity for water and is able to retain water. When hair is not washed, it becomes dirty and has a greasy feeling because the oil from our scalp and skin has built up on the hair. Shampoo is able to remove this oil by using a surfactant that is able to break down the hydrogen bonds that hold the oil to the hair. The surfactant is able to do this by surrounding the oil and breaking the hydrogen bonds, which causes the oil to become water soluble and was", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is a 1993 United States federal law that was signed into law by President Bill Clinton. The law requires that state and local governments must give people the same consideration as they would give to people of any other religion, including exemption from laws that some religious people feel violate their beliefs. The law is similar to the 1990 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which requires that the government can not burden religious practice unless it can show that doing so is the least restrictive means of furthering", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry is a theory of particle physics that states that every particle has a superpartner particle. It is an extension of the standard model of particle physics. Supersymmetry is not yet proven, but it is one of the most popular theories in particle physics and is used to explain a wide range of observations. \nThe superpartner particles of the known particles are called the squarks and the sleptons. \nThey have the same mass as the corresponding particle, but the opposite electric charge.

All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: Eating food that is not completely broken down and chewed can cause gas. Gas is usually made of air, carbon dioxide, and gases from the foods you eat. This gas can build up in the stomach and intestines and cause bloating. When you swallow air, it can also cause gas. You can reduce the amount of gas in your digestive system by chewing your food well. Chewing food well also helps your body digest the food better.\n\nIt is normal to have stinky farts. It is usually caused by gas. You can reduce the amount", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: It is possible that you are tasting something, it could be the medication. It could also be the IV fluid. If you are tasting something, it may be a sign that there is a blockage or leak in the IV line. If you are tasting saline, it may be because the saline is too warm or too cold. If you are tasting medication, it may be that the medication is too warm or too cold. If you are tasting both the medication and the IV fluid, it may be that the medication is too cold. If you are t", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely a particle is known, the less precisely its momentum is known, and vice versa. The principle was first formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927.\n\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is a consequence of the wave-particle duality of matter. It states that the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely the momentum can be known, and vice versa.

All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a lag time in a system when a change occurs.  It is the time between when the change occurs and when it is reflected in the system.  This lag time is often measured in time, but can also be measured in energy or any other physical quantity.  Hysteresis is a common feature of biological systems and is sometimes useful in engineering.  It is sometimes used to describe the relationship between time and frequency in electrical circuits.  In such cases, it is also called \"phase lag\".  Hysteresis is often characterized by a loop in the frequency-time relationship", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.  Europe, especially the countries that formed the European Union, have been socialist for a long time.  They have a much more robust social safety net, and they are willing to tax people more to support that safety net.  They are also more willing to regulate industries and companies to protect the public.  They are more willing to provide benefits to the public through the government than Americans are.  So, in some ways, they are more \"liberal\".\n\nIn the US, we are much more libertarian.  We value individual liberty more than collective well-be", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Rubbing our eyes is a way to restore our eyesight by increasing the flow of blood to the eyes. When we are tired, our body releases a hormone called adrenaline that causes our blood vessels to contract. This reduces the flow of blood to our eyes, which makes us feel tired and causes us to rub our eyes. Rubbing our eyes helps to increase the blood flow to the eyes so we can see better.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The AMD Ryzen CPUs are based on a new architecture with multiple cores, which are called \"Zen cores\". Intel CPUs have a different architecture, called \"Sandy Bridge\". This is a much older architecture that has been around for about 10 years. The cores in Intel CPUs are called \"Sandy Bridge cores\".\n\nThe two architectures have different strengths and weaknesses. The Ryzen CPUs are cheaper than the Intel CPUs, but the Intel CPUs are faster. The Ryzen CPUs are slower than the Intel CPUs, but they are cheaper. So,", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Twitching of the eyelids is a common sign of tiredness. Eyelids also twitch when you are concentrating, are stressed, are excited, or are irritated. Twitching can also be a sign of a neurological disorder.\n\nThe most common cause of eyelid twitching is fatigue. Eyelid twitching occurs when the eyelid muscles contract or spasm. This is usually caused by stress, dehydration, sleep deprivation, caffeine consumption, or certain medications.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: I think this is a good question, but I'm not sure how to answer it. Cancer is a complex disease, and there are many different types of cancer, which affect different organs and have different symptoms. So, it's hard to generalize.\n\nI will say that it is definitely possible to have a cancer without knowing it, and that you can have a cancer that is not progressing. It depends on the type of cancer and how fast it is growing.\n\nHowever, I don't think that you can have a cancer that is not progressing, and that you can be completely", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because it is. Hold music is designed to be a pleasant distraction while you wait for an agent, and is often recorded by a musician.  It is meant to be pleasant, but not distracting, and is recorded in a way that is easy to listen to on a phone.  The sound quality is compressed, and the music is often looped, so it's not annoying to listen to over and over.  The idea is to provide something that is pleasant, but not distracting, so that you can focus on your call.  If the music is too distracting, you might", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments, the region would experience a reduction in violence and an increase in stability.  It would allow the region to address its conflicts in a peaceful manner, and to create institutions that promote peaceful coexistence.  This would help to prevent the possibility of future conflicts, and create a more secure environment in which economic development could occur.

The machine translation program will give the translator a computer-generated translation of the ancient", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: The molecules in a liquid are more spread out than in a solid. This means they have more space to move around and interact with each other. It's like a big party in a small room. The more people there are, the more active the party becomes. The same thing happens when the molecules in a liquid are more active. This means they are able to react with each other more easily. This causes the molecules in the liquid to interact with each other more. This is why the smell of a wet dog is stronger than the smell of a dry one. It's also why you can smell", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The way you experience time depends on where you are in the universe because the speed of light is finite and as you move further away from the center of the universe, the speed of light will be slower. This means that time will appear to be slower for you than it does for someone who is in the same location as you, but is closer to the center of the universe.\n\nThe way that you would measure time is the same as it is for anyone else, by using a stopwatch or a clock. The only difference is that the amount of time that passes for you would be different than the amount of time that passes for", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is a unit of length in the metric system, equal to one thousandth of a meter.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: The remains of children are often preserved better than those of adults. This is because children's bones are softer and more porous than those of adults, which makes them more vulnerable to decay. Children are also smaller, which means that they are less likely to be buried with a burial shroud, making it easier to identify them.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's due to sexual dimorphism. In certain species, males and females look very different from each other. This is called sexual dimorphism.\n\nFor example, male lions have manes around their neck while female lions do not. This is an example of sexual dimorphism in lions.\n\nIn humans, the male and female bodies are very similar but there are some differences.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: The amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet is limited by the bandwidth of the cable itself. The bandwidth of a cable is the maximum amount of information that can be sent through the cable per second. The maximum amount of information that can be sent through a cable is determined by the type of cable, the size of the cable, and the distance of the cable from the device. The larger the cable, the more information it can send per second. The larger the distance the cable is from the device, the slower the information will travel.
