The box office is made up of a number of different variables. Let me explain.\n\nThe first variable is the total gross. This is the total amount of money made from ticket sales and DVD sales. This number will always be larger than the production budget. The reason for this is because the production budget is made up of several different costs.

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The Intel Core i7-6700 is an unlocked Kaby Lake quad-core processor with a base clock speed of 4 GHz, a maximum Turbo Boost frequency of 4.2 GHz, and a 95W TDP.\n\nAMD's Ryzen 7 1800X is a quad-core processor with a base clock speed of 3.6 GHz and a maximum Turbo frequency of 4.0 GHz, and a 95W TDP.\n\nSo AMD's Ryzen 7 1", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: You are experiencing the effects of sleep deprivation, which causes your body to try and make up for lost sleep.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Hello! Thank you for your question!\n\nAs you know, sugar is the type of carbohydrate that is found in many foods.  The reason why it is \"bad\" for you is because it is high in calories.  You can find sugar in candy, pastries, sodas, and fruit.  The sugar in fruit is not as bad because it comes from the fruit, which is good for you.
