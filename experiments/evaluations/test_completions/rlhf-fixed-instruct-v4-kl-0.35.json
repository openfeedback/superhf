How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: If there is a taste, it is not normal saline. There are some medications that can cause a taste in the mouth, or mouth numbness, but this is rare. There are some medications that cause the taste to be metallic, and a few medications that cause the taste to be bitter. Some medications are given at a very low dose, so the taste is not very noticeable.\n\nAnother possibility is that the IV site is not well suited for the medication. The IV site should not be in the mouth, but rather in the vein. \n\nThe", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: I'm going to get into the details of how CPUs work, and hopefully that will help you make sense of how Intel and AMD are pricing their products. I'll also go into the differences in the way the two companies go about building CPUs and how that affects their price points.\n\nCPUs are actually quite a bit more complicated than you might think.  They have to do a lot of different things in order to make your computer work.  For example, they need to run the software that you're using, they need to have a fast and efficient way to do calculations,", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a common occurrence, and it can be caused by a variety of things, including anxiety, sleep deprivation, fatigue, and even a lack of vitamins.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019re right about sugar being calorie dense. In fact, 100 grams of sugar has 360 calories. That\u2019s the same as 1/2 cup of almonds, 12 ounces of regular soda or 100 grams of processed meat.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that all calories are not created equal, this isn\u2019t a great way to think about calories.\n\nWhen you\u2019re deciding what to eat, you should focus on the types of foods you eat.

It is placed in front of the camera, so that the light that's being reflected off of it is also reflecting onto the person's face. You can usually see the reflector in the shot, but it's not a problem if you're watching the movie on a screen. It's just a device that's used to reflect the light off of a person's face so that the light comes from the right direction.\n\n\n\nA reflector is a", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a number of reasons for this, but I'll try to keep it as brief as possible.

The other reasons include hygiene, cost, and personal preference.", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because Go has more states than Chess.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: Chinese food is an interesting topic to me, because Chinese food is so nuanced and varied.  It's the food of a large country with a huge population,  and the cuisine is as diverse as the land itself.  I'm not sure I could say there is a general answer to your question.  But,  I will say that Chinese food is often quite heavy on the salt,  and salt can make a dish taste very different from what it would be without it.

What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In a typical train there are three components: the locomotive, the cars, and the track.  The locomotive provides the traction force and the ability to change speed, while the cars provide the weight and the ability to carry cargo.\n\nThe maximum amount of weight a train can pull is determined by the locomotive.  For example, a typical electric locomotive can pull 15,000 to 30,000 pounds, but some locomotives can pull up to 40,000 pounds.  There are also diesel-electric locomotives that can pull 6", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: [removed]", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Some smells are more easily detected by the human nose when the air is moist. This is because moist air holds more particles than dry air. When you are wet, your body loses more water than it would when dry, which means there are more particles of you in the air.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: One of the main goals of the LHC is to discover the Higgs Boson, which is a particle believed to be responsible for giving other particles their mass. This is a very important discovery because it would give a complete understanding of the \"Standard Model\" of particle physics, which explains all the fundamental particles and their interactions. The LHC will also be used to search for new particles beyond the Standard Model. It is hoped that these new particles will provide insight into what happened in the early universe and how it evolved.", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The political spectrum is a one-dimensional political space that divides political positions on the left-right axis, from collectivism to individualism. The left-right axis is a political spectrum within which individuals, parties, and voters may be positioned. The left-right axis is often used in political discussions to describe political positions, especially in the United States and other Western countries. In the United States, the left-right axis is often used to divide the two major political parties.\n\nThe left-right axis is sometimes called the political spectrum or political compass. It is also sometimes called the political spectrum,", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure what you mean. I don't think you'll age a year by going somewhere else in the galaxy, but I don't know if you'll age 20 or 30 years. I don't think a stopwatch will show you how many years you've been gone.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well the meter is defined as the length of the path that light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 seconds. The standard meter was defined as 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of light emitted by a Krypton-86 atom. The SI unit of length is the meter. The meter was first defined by a resolution of the CGPM in 1889. The meter was defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during 1/299,", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, when you are a baby or small child, the cornea, which is the clear dome over the front of the eye, is very thin and pliable. So when you put something in your eye, the cornea stretches and becomes deformed, which causes pain. As you grow older, your cornea becomes less pliable and less likely to get deformed, so it is much less likely to cause pain.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, the thing is that planet 9's existence is not confirmed, but it is also not ruled out.

But before that, I want to tell you something that is very important. Sometimes, you may have a question to ask, but the question may not be well-posed. This means that the question may not make sense, or it may be ambiguous. For example, a question such as \"Is cannibalism bad for a species?\" is not well-posed because the word \"bad\" is ambiguous. It may mean that cannibalism is bad for a species in the sense that it is harmful to the species, or it may", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I have no idea.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The Cyprus issue is actually a very complicated one, and is a major sticking point in the EU, since Cyprus is part of the European Union and it's split between two countries.\n\nThe main reason why the Cyprus issue hasn't been resolved is because both sides have very different opinions about the future of the island, and they have been unable to come to a consensus over what the island should look like.\n\nThe 1974 war resulted in the division of Cyprus, with the Greek Cypriots controlling the southern two-thirds of the island", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children.

It came out in 1989 and was made by Nintendo. It was an IR LED and a phototransistor. When you pressed the trigger, it would send a signal to the NES, indicating that you wanted to shoot something. The IR LED would shoot a beam of light, which would hit the phototransistor. The NES would then use this information to know when to shoot something in the game. The gun would send the signal through the cable that came with the gun, and then the N", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

It requires a great deal of willpower and motivation to get out of bed and to wake up. This is why waking up in the morning is difficult, because it requires an effort of the will to get out of bed.\n\nSecondly, waking up in the morning can be dreadful because people often feel sluggish, tired, and unmotivated. This is especially true if they stayed", "\n\nHuman: Why do pupils dilate on drugs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is one of the many ways that drugs can effect our bodies, and it is just one of many ways in which they can do so.", "\n\nHuman: Why do most men go bald, in spite of all the testosterone?\n\nI'm 25, I have a full beard, I have new hair coming out on my back and shoulders but the hair on top of my head have started falling.

In this grammar, a sentence is broken down into a set of 'dependencies' between words. For example, in the sentence \"John likes Mary,\" we can break the sentence down into two dependencies: John likes Mary, and Mary is liked by John.\n\nIn the example, we know that John is the subject of the sentence, and Mary is the object of the sentence. In other words, John is the subject of the sentence because he is the person doing the liking, and Mary is the object", "\n\nHuman: why almost every japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children\n\nI have just noticed this trend tbh and i never wondered why this was. It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: This is a very interesting question, I'm not sure I have the answer to it, but I can tell you that I think it has to do with the fact that people in Japan tend to be more open minded about things.", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The process of hibernation in animals is very different from that of sleep in humans. In hibernation, the animal's metabolism slows to the point that it does not need food. This allows the animal to hibernate for long periods of time while conserving energy. The animal wakes up only when the weather warms up and it needs to eat. Hibernation in animals can last for months or even years.\n\nIn humans, sleep and hibernation are two different things. Sleep is a restful period of time where the body is relaxed and the mind is at ease. This is", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: One of the things that makes it easier to understand a language is that you are familiar with the words. For example, if you know how to say \"hello\" in a language, you already know a lot of words that you might need to say. You can use those words to express yourself. \n\nAnother reason understanding a language is easier than speaking it is that you can understand a lot of sentences at a time. If you speak a language, you can only speak one sentence at a time. But if you read a language, you can understand a lot of sentences at a time.", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: They don't.", "\n\nHuman: What volume of water is required to drown a human?\n\nAnd a second, slightly sillier question, can someone drown swallowing only a mouthful of water?\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: what is the reason for those few extra blank white pages in the back of a book?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In the past, publishers used the blank pages to make sure that the book was complete.

If they do not have the same name as every other person that's on the ballot, they will not be able to be listed.  So, if there's someone with the exact same name as you, your name would not be on the ballot.  This means you'd have to write in your name in order for people to be able to vote for you.\n\nThere's nothing illegal about this.  The person running for office can't change their name", "\n\nHuman: How did people used to train pigeons to carry mail at the long distance, back in the day?\n\nI was always curious, did they have different pigeon for each address and if not, how pigeon knows whom to send? \n\nAssistant: The pigeons would be trained to carry mail.  The pigeons would be trained to go to a mailbox at a certain address and return to the pigeon loft.  The pigeon would then be rewarded with food.  The pigeon would then learn that if it goes to a mailbox with a letter, it will be given food.  The pigeon would then learn that if it goes to a mailbox and retrieves a letter, it will be given food.

When the myoglobin is exposed to oxygen, it oxidizes, and turns brown. Red meat has a higher amount of myoglobin, so it will lose less of it, and turn brown when cooked.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: The calculator tries to divide the number by zero, and the result is that the calculator displays an error message.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: People eat fast food because they do not have the time to prepare healthy food.", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: Well, I'm not an expert on this, but I think that one major factor is that politicians have to raise a lot of money to run for office and campaigns are so expensive that it makes it hard for candidates to run a truly centrist campaign.", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods?

Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: Depression can be caused by the presence of a number of ingredients in prescription drugs. A common side effect of the antibiotic Amoxicillin is depression. The antidepressant Prozac is a common antidepressant that has been shown to cause depression. It can also cause drowsiness, nausea, dry mouth, and weight gain. The antibiotic Cipro can also cause depression. \n\nIn the antidepressant Zoloft, depression is listed as a side effect.

Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: There is no evidence to suggest that smaller animals have shorter life expectancy, and in fact there are many examples of small animals with a longer life expectancy.\n\nIf we were to take the average lifespan of all animals, it would be around 13 years. However, this is not necessarily true for every species. Some small species have a lifespan of around 15 years, and some large animals have a lifespan of 100 years or more.\n\nThere are many possible reasons for this. Smaller animals may live shorter lives because their environment is more hostile. For example", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: You call your parents mom and dad because they are the people who take care of you, nurture you, and raise you.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number.

The capacitor is the big, black canister-shaped thing.\n\nWhen you turn on the TV, the capacitor is powering the TV's electronics. When you turn the TV off, the capacitor is still powering the electronics.\n\nThe capacitor is trying to discharge all its energy at once, and the only way it can do that is to produce a large amount of energy in a short time.\n\nThe capacitor is a mechanical device. So when it discharges, it produces a very", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries lose their charge by a chemical reaction that converts chemical energy stored in the battery to electrical energy. Batteries contain a chemical called an electrolyte, which is a solution of salts in a liquid that conducts electricity. This electrolyte contains the chemicals that allow the reaction to occur. As the battery is used, the chemicals in the electrolyte are depleted, and the battery can no longer produce enough electrical energy to power the appliance.\n\nBatteries lose their charge by a chemical reaction that converts chemical energy stored in the battery to electrical energy.

The reason we can see colours is because of the cones in our eyes, which are responsible for our vision. Cones are the colour receptors in our eyes. There are three types of cones, each one sensitive to a different part of the spectrum of light. The longest wavelengths (longest) are the most easily detected by our eyes, and the shortest wavelengths (shortest) are the least easily detected by our eyes.", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In general, countries with high poverty rates, low income, and high debts are considered to be underdeveloped.", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nIt's cheaper to access the internet than to have a secure network.

The light that we can see with our telescopes is the light that has been emitted by the objects that we see. If you look at an object that emits light, like a star, the light is always traveling away from it. This means that if we look at a star from Earth, we see light that left that star a very long time ago. Light can travel for a long distance, but it can't travel through solid material. The Earth is a solid material, and so the light can'", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's not really the liquid itself that dehydrates you; it's what the liquid replaces in your diet that dehydrates you. A can of soda has 35-40 grams of sugar in it, which has 4 calories per gram. 1000 calories equals 4000 calories. So if you drink 10 cans of soda per day, you are consuming 4000 calories per day from sugar alone. 4000 calories is a lot of calories, and the", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I am not a computer so I don't know the answer to that question.

If you mean countries with different electrical plugs, you should know that different countries have different voltages and frequencies. So the same device with the same plug may need a different adapter to work in different countries. For example, if you have a laptop from the US and you want to use it in a country in Europe, you need a different adapter because European countries have 220V and 50Hz while the US has 110V and 60Hz.\n\nIf you mean different outlets, the answer is simple.

The skin has two layers, the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is the outer layer of the skin, which is made of cells that grow from the bottom to the top. The cells that make up the epidermis are dead, but they contain a protein that holds water, and the amount of water in the cells changes as the temperature changes. This is what makes the skin feel hot or cold. The dermis is the inner layer of the skin. The dermis has a lot of blood vessels,", "\n\nHuman: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are a number of possible reasons for this behaviour. It may be a result of people's being unconscious of their own behaviour, or that they're simply trying to test your knowledge. It may be a result of the social context. For example, it may be that they're trying to appear more intelligent, or that they're trying to see if you know something they don't know. It may be that they want to be helpful. For example, they may be trying to get you to help them understand something that they don't know.

Let's say you have a circle that has a radius of 1. Then, the area of the circle is going to be pi times the radius squared, which is going to be 3.6. Now, the area of the circle is going to be pi times the radius squared minus the radius. So, we're going to take pi times the radius squared minus 1, which is going to be 3.6 minus 1, which is going to be 2.6. So, the area of the circle is going to be 2.6.
