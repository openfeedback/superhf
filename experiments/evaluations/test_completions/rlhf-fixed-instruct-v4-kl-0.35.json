I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: There are no regulations on the cancer rate for livestock, and there are no requirements for the cancer rate for meat to be consumed. As for eating cancerous cells, I don't think that's a good idea.\n\nI'm not an expert, and I don't know if eating cancerous cells is as bad as eating cancerous tissue. I do know that the risk of cancer increases as you get older and that eating a lot of meat increases your risk of cancer, and there are some studies that show eating a lot of meat can cause cancer.", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops. If I was to cut it in half, how would it know to start growing again?\n\nAssistant: The hair follicle doesn't know anything. It's the nerve endings in the skin that signal to the hair follicle whether to grow, stop, or change size.", "\n\nHuman: How do wireless phone chargers work\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand your question.", "\n\nHuman: What are sensitive teeth? My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth, or sensitive dentin, refers to the sensation of pain felt when the teeth are exposed to hot, cold, or sweet foods or drinks. Dentin is the tissue that makes up the bulk of the tooth, and it contains sensory nerves. When the enamel wears down, these nerves are exposed, causing the pain associated with sensitive teeth.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: Well, hair is made up of different types of cells, and some of those cells are in a state of active growth. When you don't wash your hair for a while, those cells have time to grow and multiply.  Eventually, the cells start to clog up the hair shaft, which causes the hair to look greasy and dirty.  Shampoo contains surfactants, which are molecules that are attracted to water, and that are also attracted to the hair and the oil in the hair.  When the surfactants come into contact with the hair and the oil, they", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The point of the bill is to allow religious freedom in Indiana and to allow business owners to deny service to people based on their religious beliefs. The bill is also intended to stop the federal government from intruding into the private lives of Indiana citizens. It was signed into law on March 26, 2015.", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: supersymmetry is a theory of symmetry in quantum physics, that posits that every particle is accompanied by a 'sparticle' that has a different quantum number and is usually much heavier than the particle itself.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: I'll be sure to ask my dermatologist the next time I see her.", "\n\nHuman: What is actually happening when your heart \"aches\"?\n\nAssistant: That is actually a very common human experience, and it's one that's been around for a long time. It can be caused by a lot of things, but the main cause is that your heart is producing more adrenaline than it is used to, which causes the pain that we know as \"heartache.\" Adrenaline is a hormone that your body produces when it is under stress, and it is often produced when your heart is beating faster than it normally does. When this happens, your body begins to pump more blood throughout your body, and the hormone adrenaline", "\n\nHuman: Can anybody explain me what science says about \"Ghost\"?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hi, I'm a natural language processing AI that can understand your question and search for the answer.", "\n\nHuman: Why are peanuts so much more affordable than other nuts?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but it's probably because they are a dried legume.", "\n\nHuman: How do compression shorts and compression tights help athletes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Compression garments are designed to improve blood circulation, reduce muscle fatigue and speed up recovery after exercise. They work by applying a gentle pressure on the muscles and veins, which increases blood flow and helps to remove lactic acid from muscles. This is achieved through the compression garments compressing the tissue and muscles, which helps to push the blood through the veins faster. By doing this, lactic acid is moved out of the muscles quicker and the muscles are therefore able to recover faster.\n\n\nCompression garments work best when the athlete is exercising intens", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens when you pull your back? I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's a common cause of back pain, which is a very common condition. In the vast majority of cases, it is an acute condition that resolves after a few days. But in some people, it can be a more chronic condition, and sometimes it is related to more serious conditions.", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: Good questions!\n\nThe market for a currency is determined by supply and demand, just like the market for any good.\n\nThere are many factors that influence supply and demand. Economists use the term \"fundamentals\" to refer to these factors, and the most important fundamentals for currencies are the country's inflation rate, interest rates, trade balance, and GDP growth rate.\n\nThese fundamentals are largely uncontrollable and the market is simply responding to the economic health of the country. For example, if a country is experiencing very high inflation, investors", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hippy generation did not need to have careers. It was a period in which many people were making enough money to afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle. It was also a time in which there was a lot of unrest in the country, and many people were making political statements by having hippy lifestyles, which made it easier to afford to do so.", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day.

Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: I'll try.\n\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that if you know something exactly, you cannot know something else exactly.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a photon of light. It has momentum and position. You measure the momentum and you get p1. You measure the position and you get x1.\n\nNow, you want to know the momentum and position of the photon. So you measure the momentum again and you get p2. Now, you measure the position again and you get x2.\n\nThe difference between p1 and p2 is less than the uncertainty", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis?

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: AMD has been making CPUs for a while longer than Intel, and have a more diverse product line. Intel is more of a specialty CPU manufacturer, focusing on only high-end chips. In the 2000s, Intel introduced a new product line called \"Core\", which is their \"high-end\" series of CPUs. AMD has a similar product line called \"Opteron\".\n\nThe Core i5 is a 6-core CPU, and the Opteron 6300 is a 6-core CPU. The i5 is $160", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We don't know.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: The amount of calories is actually a very good indicator of the potential health risk. It's not an absolute indicator, but it's certainly a very good one.\n\nBut I don't want to get into that. Let's first focus on the question of why sugar is bad.\n\nIt's bad for a few reasons. First of all, it's very easy to over consume sugar.  One of the main reasons we have so many obese people in the US is because we have such easy access to sugar.\n\nThe second reason is that sugar is very addictive.", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

The upvote system is implemented in a way where a user can upvote a post once. A post can be upvoted multiple times, however this is not how it works. If a user wants to upvote a post multiple times, he can do so by upvoting it again. If he does so, he will only be able to upvote it once more. This is why you see a lot of users voting in a way that they only upvote a post once, instead of multiple times.

Chlorophyll is green because it absorbs light in the red and blue portions of the visible spectrum.", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: You are correct, it is the same chemical. This is a very good question, which has not been answered conclusively. There is a lot of speculation about it, and it is possible that there are other factors involved. It is possible that there is a threshold level that needs to be met for a positive test. However, I don't know of any research to support this.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If a liquid has the property of not being able to flow (or flow very slowly), then it is a solid, not a liquid.", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre was trying to destroy Skyfleet because the stock in Skyfleet was the collateral for his gambling debt. The Skyfleet stock was Le Chiffre's only real asset, and the only way for him to pay off his debt was to destroy the stock.", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form?

The way I'd like to answer this question is by saying that in Chess, the number of possible moves is finite because all of the pieces are restricted to a finite number of positions on the board. In Go, however, the number of possible moves is infinite because the players can choose to move their stones anywhere on the board.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.

A major record label, like Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group, and the like, are the largest record labels in the world. They are the record labels that are in the top tier of the music business and have the most clout with artists, producers, and managers. They have the most money to spend on talent, and they have the most influence in the music business. They are", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The maximum weight of a train is determined by the weight of its locomotive, the weight of its cars, the distance it travels, the grade it ascends, the train speed, and the amount of time it takes to pull the train.\n\nThe locomotive's weight, including fuel, depends on its size and the amount of fuel it consumes. Locomotive weight ranges from 25 to 300 tons.\n\nThe weight of the cars depends on the number of axles the car has and the number of wheels each axle has.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The Cyprus conflict is complex and has been going on for many years. It is one of the most difficult problems in the European Union. The main reason why the conflict is still ongoing is because of the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974. In that year, Turkey occupied about 37% of the island and annexed the northern part, which it now refers to as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Turkey does not recognize the Republic of Cyprus, which is the internationally recognized government of the Republic of Cyprus.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Theoretical bandwidth is the amount of information that can be transferred by a cable modem in one second.  In practice, the bandwidth that is available is limited by many factors.  For example, if you have a cable modem that supports 256 kbps bandwidth and you have 45 subscribers on the cable modem, then the theoretical bandwidth that could be sent is 256 kbps x 45 subscribers = 11.4 MBps, but in practice the bandwidth that is available is limited by the amount of bandwidth used by all the", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It's not clear.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem?

The light gun is a gun-shaped device that emits infrared light, and is connected to the NES by a cable. When the light gun is aimed at the TV, a picture is taken, and the NES uses the picture to determine where the gun is pointing. The NES uses the position of the gun to determine what is happening on the screen, and moves the on-screen characters accordingly. This allows the user to use the gun to control what happens on the screen. The light gun is also used to play many", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the current situation?", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The division of 0 by 0 is undefined.

[USA]\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: If you ignore medical bills you will be taken to court and the bill will become a judgment. Judgments are public record and are reported to credit reporting agencies. A judgment can be reported for up to 10 years.\n\nA judgment will stay on your credit report for 10 years and affect your credit score. Judgments can also affect your ability to get a loan.\n\nA judgment can also be reported to the IRS and the state department of revenue, which may lead to a tax lien and possibly a tax levy.\n\nA judgment is a lien against your property", "\n\nHuman: If I smoke pot, and a week later get in a car accident where someone dies, will i go to prison?\n\nI know whenever someone is seriously injured or killed in a car accident, both drivers blood are taken to check for intoxication.  Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: First, I think this is a great question, as it is very relevant to a lot of people.  I would say that, in the United States, it would depend on the state you are in.  In some states, marijuana is legal, and in others, it is not.  Also, I think it would depend on how many people were in the car with you, and how many people were in the other car.  For example, if you were driving a car, and you were by yourself, and you were the only person injured, it is probably not a big deal.  But if you had", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure of the exact etymology, but I can tell you that it's definitely a common expression, and that it means \"one of you and another person,\" as you suggested.", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: I'm not a mechanical engineer, but I'd assume that plastic is cheaper than metal, and the wing nuts keep the bolts from falling off in the event that the toilet seat is dropped.  The wing nuts could also be used to adjust the seat height.  The bolts could be used to adjust the width of the seat.", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: I don't know what I'm doing with my life.", "\n\nHuman: If there's being such serious human rights violations goiing on in Qatar, and FIFA aren't doing anything about it, then how come none of the world governments or the UN are putting pressure on something to be done?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know.  But the truth is that the world's governments and the UN are not able to do something about it.  And the reason why they can't do something is because they are not able to, and because they are not able to, they don't try to do something.  It's a vicious cycle.  It's not about the people who make up the governments, it's about the system itself.  And the system is such that the people who govern, who have the power, they have the power to do something, and they have the power", "\n\nHuman: Sure Deposit\n\nI am being told that, despite having deposit in the name, it's just an unrelated fee.

However, we know that the virus must be suppressed in order for the body to recover.\n\nWe also know that the immune system can be suppressed by a number of factors. 1) The person is already ill and has a weakened immune system. 2) The virus is too powerful for the body to fight. 3) The body is too weak to fight the virus.\n\nWe also know that the virus can be suppressed by a number", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry to hear you feel that way, but I'm not sure I can help with that.

The pupil is the opening that allows light to enter the eye. As light enters the eye, the iris and the pupil constrict, or narrow, to adjust the amount of light that enters the eye. The pupils are controlled by the autonomic nervous system, which also controls involuntary functions such as heartbeat and digestion.\n\nDrugs like marijuana and LSD can cause the pupils to dilate. This is because they affect the autonomic nervous system. This is", "\n\nHuman: Why do most men go bald, in spite of all the testosterone?\n\nI'm 25, I have a full beard, I have new hair coming out on my back and shoulders but the hair on top of my head have started falling.

Constipation is a digestive disorder in which bowel movements occur infrequently and/or with difficulty.", "\n\nHuman: What Is the Chomsky Grammar Heirarchy and How Does It Work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Chomsky hierarchy is a theory of the kinds of languages that are possible to have. It is the most important theory of this kind since Chomsky developed it in the 1950s. It has had a large influence on many areas of computer science, and was a key factor in the development of the field of artificial intelligence. It also has applications to psycholinguistics and psychology. The Chomsky hierarchy consists of five levels:", "\n\nHuman: why almost every japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children\n\nI have just noticed this trend tbh and i never wondered why this was.

We use words to communicate our thoughts and ideas. Understanding a language is easier than speaking it because it involves less effort. \n\n\n\nTo understand a language, you need to understand the grammar rules and the meaning of words. \n\nYou need to know how to speak the words, and how to put them together to form sentences, and how to form sentences to express your ideas. \n\nTo speak the words, you need to know the pronunciation of the words. \n\nTo put words together, you need to know the grammar rules. \n\nTo", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: I think they use their hands to feel for the text.", "\n\nHuman: What volume of water is required to drown a human?\n\nAnd a second, slightly sillier question, can someone drown swallowing only a mouthful of water?\n\nAssistant: 165 litres of water.\n\nAnd yes, a person can drown by swallowing a mouthful of water, although it may not kill them.\n\nIt depends on the size of the person, but a large person would likely drown if they swallowed a mouthful of water.\n\nThe person would stop breathing, and would die by asphyxiation within 2-3 minutes.\n\nBut a person could also survive a mouthful of water. The water would be absorbed into the lungs, which would cause water intoxication, which would stop the person", "\n\nHuman: what is the reason for those few extra blank white pages in the back of a book?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There is no reason.

The pigeon mail system was very successful in the 19th century and was used to send messages around the world, across the US, and in some cases across the Atlantic Ocean.  However, in the 20th century, the pigeon mail service was replaced with pneumatic tubes.  A pneumatic tube is a system of tubes that delivers messages from one location to another using compressed air.  Today, pneumatic tubes are used to deliver small items, such as cash and receipts.\n\nIn the", "\n\nHuman: Why are people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war shamed instead of admired?

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: I am not aware of any current research in this area.  However, I think you are on the right track.  In fact, I think it is entirely possible that we may be able to bring back a Neanderthal in the near future.  The only question is:  Would we want to?", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The difference between a transgender and transsexual is that a transgender is a person who identifies as a gender other than the one that they were assigned at birth, while a transsexual is a person who transitions from one gender to another.", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know, I'm an AI.", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Well, the most successful ones are typically very well-managed and have a reputation for providing good customer service.

Water has a high specific heat capacity, so it takes a lot of heat to boil water and cook the shrimp. Fat, on the other hand, has a low specific heat capacity and doesn't take much heat to heat up, so it cooks faster and browns faster than the shrimp.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't have a good answer to that.", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but I think the answer is in the fact that we're all more connected nowadays. Technology has allowed us to keep in touch with many people, from all over the world. This has given us a more global perspective, and I think that's causing us to disagree more with each other, and perhaps be more polarized.", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods? Meaning, you had to live in the same block/city to connect to it? \n\n\nAssistant: Yes, BBSes were popular in the 1980s and 1990s.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: I am not an expert on the history of transsexual rights in Iran, but I am a sociologist of religion, and I can tell you a little about the cultural context in which these views are held.\n\nIran has a long tradition of religious mysticism, and mysticism is often connected with a more accepting view of transsexuality.\n\nFor example, one of the most famous mystics of Iran, Abdul-Husayn Ibn Sina (also known as Avicenna), is said to have had transsexual and homosexual tendencies.\n\nIn", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: There are many factors that can lead to depression from taking prescription drugs. For example, a patient may take an antidepressant because they have been diagnosed with depression. They may also be taking other medications, such as blood pressure medication, which may cause drowsiness. The combination of these two medications may lead to the patient feeling depressed.\n\nThis is a very common side effect in patients who are taking medication for depression.\n\nAnother common side effect is weight gain. Antidepressants can have a high calorie content in them. If a patient is taking", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear? Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: Water has a high reflectivity for light in the blue wavelengths. This is due to the water molecule having a bent shape with a positive charge on one end and a negative charge on the other end. The charges push the molecule to be close together, which in turn makes it a strong reflector of light. This causes the water to appear blue.\n\nThe sky is blue because the light from the sun is scattered by the molecules in the atmosphere. This causes the light to have a higher frequency and a shorter wavelength. When the light hits our atmosphere, it is scattered", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but maybe you can ask someone else?", "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between 32 and 64bit computer systems, and why aren't there, say 128bit systems.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 32 bit systems can address 4GB of memory, while 64 bit systems can address 16TB of memory.", "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure that I understand your question.

However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: That is an interesting question.\n\nEducation and left-wing ideology are correlated, in that people who are more educated tend to be more left-leaning, but it is not clear that one causes the other.\n\nEducation and left-wing ideology are both correlated with income, and income and education are both correlated with age, so it is hard to tease out the effect of education on ideology from the effect of income on ideology and the effect of age on ideology.\n\nEducation and left-wing ideology are both correlated with gender, so it is hard", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: There are many factors that determine how the voice sounds when singing. The most important thing is that the vocal cords have to be in a certain state to make a sound. They have to be relaxed, and the sound can't be too forceful. So when people who aren't used to singing do it, they often make it too forceful.", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the vapour is very light and is carried by the wind. If the wind was stronger or less strong, the cloud might change shape.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is not true that smaller animals live shorter lives than larger animals. In fact, the opposite is true. In general, larger animals live longer than smaller animals. There are some exceptions to this rule, such as some whales and sharks. However, these exceptions are generally the larger members of their species. In general, the size of an animal is not a good indicator of how long it will live.\n\nSmall animals do not have the same resources that large animals have. They have limited food, limited shelter, limited space. They do not have the ability to get the same amount of oxygen that larger animals do", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \"significant\" in this context?", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Your liver has two main functions:\n1. It produces bile and stores bile. Bile is a substance that helps digest fats and helps you digest food by mixing with the food in your stomach and breaking it down into a form your body can use.\n2. Your liver also produces proteins and other substances that help your body function.\n\nFats and cholesterol are broken down in your small intestine by bile that comes from your liver. Your small intestine breaks down the fat and cholesterol into fatty acids and", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: Yes, the noise is called a \"Harmonic\". The noise is a combination of the mains frequency (50/60 Hz in most countries) and the color subcarrier frequency (3.575 MHz in the US). The sound is caused by an interference between the power line frequency and the color subcarrier frequency.\n\nThe ringing sound you hear when the TV is turned off is caused by a very low frequency (typically 50/60 Hz) and is called the \"hum\". It is caused by the residual electricity in the TV's", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a very good question. In a battery, a chemical reaction takes place between two dissimilar substances: the anode and the cathode. The anode is made of a substance that releases electrons. The cathode is made of a substance that accepts electrons. The electrons are carried from the anode to the cathode through the conducting wires. When the electrons are carried to the cathode, they travel through a circuit to a device that uses the electricity. The chemical reaction at the anode is reversed at the cathode, so the electrons can travel back to the", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles.

Children tend to like to spin in circles, but it's not necessarily a behavior they'll continue as they get older.", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sure. The Big Bang Theory is the idea that the universe began with a singularity, a single point of infinite density and temperature that exploded, forming the cosmic expansion. The universe was born in a Big Bang. The Big Bang was a rapid expansion of space and time, but it was not a bang as in sound or an explosion. The Big Bang is the simplest and most popular model of the early universe. It has many successes, such as explaining the origin of the elements, the cosmic background radiation, and the abundance of matter. The Big Bang model also has some puzzles. For example,", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I do not understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: The Jerry Springer Show\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: [removed]", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: I think the general consensus is that people find animals cute when they are young and small, and this is a sort of evolutionary trait to ensure that people care for and protect young animals.", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Ethernet is a communication protocol for transmitting data over a computer network. It was originally developed by Xerox PARC between 1973 and 1974 and is named after the electrical cable used to connect a computer to the Xerox Alto computer system.\n\nEthernet is one of the most widely used computer networking technologies.

The government uses the internet to communicate with each other.  That's how they do it.  They don't want to build their own network.  It would be very expensive to do that.  It would be very hard to do that.  It's just easier to use the internet.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Vegetables release water when they are cut and exposed to air.

This hormone is also responsible for regulating appetite and controlling the satiation response, so when you feel full, you're not hungry anymore. This is why you feel so full after eating a large meal, especially if it's high in fat, but you still feel hungry after eating a low-fat meal.\n\nThis spike in serotonin", "\n\nHuman: How and why did Pokemon win the popularity contest against Digimon?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know, but I do think that Digimon is superior.", "\n\nHuman: Why our stomach muscles tense when we cough?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, you can think of it like this: when you cough, your diaphragm contracts, which in turn pushes your lungs up and down, forcing air out of your mouth.

If player one has two cards and player two has one card, then they have the same number of chips. If player one has one card and player two has three cards, then player one has less chips than player two.\n\nWe can define a winning player as the player with the most number of chips", "\n\nHuman: What are the benefits of using online learning tools?\n\nAssistant: Online learning tools have many benefits, but one of the biggest benefits is that they can be accessed anytime, anywhere.
