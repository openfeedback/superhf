I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.\n\nA Neanderthal genome has been sequenced, but we do not have a full Neanderthal genome.  We have a draft sequence that was generated by sequencing a Neanderthal genome fragment.  We do not know if the genome is complete, or if it is a draft sequence of a complete genome.  If it is a complete genome, then it is not possible to bring one back into existence.  If it is a draft sequence of a complete genome, then it is possible to bring one back into existence.

The paradox states that a set is defined to contain all and only the elements that are members of that set. Thus, if a set S contains itself as a member, then S is a member of S. This would make S a member of itself and thus a member of itself, which is a contradiction.\n\nRussell's paradox is used to show that naive set theory is inconsistent, and thus that naive set theory is not a complete formal system. It is often used to illustrate the", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing?

What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: Thank you.\n\nWater is clear, but when sunlight hits it, it scatters and reflects blue light more than red light. This causes the ocean to look blue. Blue is a color that we see because it reflects the most light. Green is the color that absorbs the most light.\n\nWater is blue because it is a good reflector of blue light. Red light is absorbed by water because red light has more energy than blue light. Water is green because it absorbs more red light than blue light. Water is clear because it is transparent.

It is measured using a statistical index called the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates perfect equality and 1 indicates perfect inequality. In other words, the Gini coefficient indicates the percentage of income that is held by the top 20% of the population compared to the bottom 20%. The higher the Gini coefficient, the greater the level of income inequality in a society.\n\nA number of studies have exam", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge? If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question. \n\nFreeway overpasses are designed to be tall enough to allow tall vehicles to travel underneath them. \n\nThe height of an overpass is usually determined by the maximum height of the tallest vehicle that is allowed to travel on the road. \n\nThis is done so that vehicles can safely travel underneath the overpass without being too tall to clear the overpass. \n\nWhen designing an overpass, the height of the overpass is determined by the maximum height of a vehicle that is allowed to travel on the road. \n\nThe", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly.

What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.\n\nSignificant digits are the digits used to represent a number in a calculation or a measurement.\n\nSignificant digits are used in arithmetic and measurements to represent a number.\n\nIn most calculations, you will not be able to represent a number exactly.\n\nFor example, if you have a number that is 22.3 + 3.45, you cannot use the number 25.75, because that is not an exact number.\n\nSignificant digits are used to represent a number exactly.\n\nTo represent a number exactly, you", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for using Ask a Biologist. Bile is stored in the gallbladder and is produced by the liver. It is released into the duodenum and small intestine to help break down fats. The liver also produces bile acids which are then released into the blood stream. These bile acids help break down fats in the small intestine. Fats are also broken down by enzymes from the pancreas and saliva. Saliva is also used to break down carbohydrates.
