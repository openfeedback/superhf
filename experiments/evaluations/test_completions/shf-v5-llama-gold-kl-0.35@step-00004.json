The egg contains amino acids that are naturally hydrophobic, which means they do not like water. On the other hand, the pasta contains amino acids that are naturally hydrophilic, which means they", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hi, welcome to [removed]", "\n\nHuman: The Watergate scandal and why it happened\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Why did it happen?", "\n\nHuman: You don't sail, pilot, or drive a kayak, surely.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Scientists have tried to do this, but have so far been unsuccessful.  In the past, the problem has been that the Neanderthal genome is so different from ours that it would be very difficult to modify the human genome in such a way as to be able to insert it into a human egg.  This is because the human genome has a lot of redundancy, so if a tiny section of DNA is changed, the human could die.  In addition, it would be very difficult to know if the genome that scientists insert into a human egg is the Neanderthal gen", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I am sorry sir, but we do not have that information.", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: They have a lot of money.", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the cooking process breaks down the pigments in the muscle cells, not the food.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: I think it doesn't know what to do, and so it shows error.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I think it's because people like to eat fast foods because they are convenient, easy to get, and easy to make.", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: You should read the book The Rise of the Creative Class by Richard Florida.", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods?
