Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to know both the momentum and position of a particle at the same time. It is a principle of quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of very small particles. The uncertainty principle states that if you want to know both the position and momentum of a particle, then you must make a measurement on it. Making a measurement on a particle will disturb its position, and changing its position will change its momentum. This is called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It says that the more precisely you measure the position of a particle, the less you know about its momentum, and the more precisely you measure", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis?

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is bad for your health.  The body can only use a limited amount of sugar, and excess sugar in the diet causes problems.  Sugar is often added to processed foods to make them more tasty.  Sugar is also often used in sodas, which can be harmful to the body.  In addition, sugar is often added to baked goods, which can lead to weight gain.

The mouse protocol is defined by the International Standards Organization (ISO). The mouse protocol uses a special encoding to allow the mouse to communicate with the monitor without the monitor having to know what type of mouse is communicating with it.\n\nThe mouse protocol defines several different types of commands. The most common commands are left-click, right-click, and scroll-up and scroll-down. Other commands are available.

The locomotive uses wheels to pull the train. The train can pull cars of different sizes. The heaviest cars are usually called \"freight cars\" and the lightest are called \"passenger cars.\" A locomotive can pull a train with many different kinds of cars. A train usually pulls cars that are the same size. The weight of the train depends on how many cars it has and what kind of cars they are.", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Well, it's not that simple.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: I think you're confusing the Cyprus problem with the Cyprus dispute. Cyprus was split when the British withdrew from the island in 1960. The Greek Cypriots, who made up the majority of the population, wanted to join Greece and the Turkish Cypriots wanted to join Turkey. The British had been in control of the island since 1878, and during World War II, the island was used as a military base. After the war, the British decided to pull out of the island and allow the two communities to decide their own fate.

Arteries are elastic tubes that carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the body. Arteries have thick muscular walls that are supported by a layer of connective tissue.\n\nArteries are formed during development, by the fusion of multiple small blood vessels. During development, blood vessels are surrounded by a thin layer of cells called endothelium.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The answer to your question is that it is possible, but not likely to happen in the near future. The Neanderthal genome has been sequenced and we have a relatively good understanding of the genetic differences between humans and Neanderthals. However, we cannot recreate a Neanderthal, or even bring one back into existence, because of the way that DNA works. DNA is very complicated and has a very specific structure. A Neanderthal genome has roughly the same number of genes as a human genome, but the genes in the Neanderthal genome are not in the", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I don't understand.", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I don't understand.", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Well, I don't know, I guess it's because there are a lot of people who drink beer.", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The red meat has myoglobin, which is an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color.

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: This is a really interesting question. When people sing, they use different parts of their larynx, which is the area of the throat that contains the vocal folds. When we speak, we use the vocal folds in the larynx to produce sound. When we sing, we use the same vocal folds, but we also use muscles in our larynx to change the shape of the vocal folds. This creates a different sound, called a \"voice\". When we sing, we use our lungs to produce sound. When we speak, we use the vocal folds to create sound.
