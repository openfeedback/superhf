They make their host sick because they need to replicate in the host's body.\n\nViruses such as Ebola are designed to replicate in the body, and to do this they need to use the host's cells to replicate. If they replicate faster than the host can produce them, they will eventually kill the host.\n\nViruses such as Ebola also need to use the host's immune system to replicate, because this is how they spread to other cells", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I've just been given a list of the things I need to do today.", "\n\nHuman: Why do pupils dilate on drugs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A human with a dilated pupil is an idiot.\n\n\n\n\nA human is a human.\n\n\n\n\nA human is a human.\n\n\n\n\nA human is a human.\n\n\n\n\nA human is a human.\n\n\n\n\nA human is a human.\n\n\n\n\nA human is a human.\n\n\n\n\nA human is a human.\n\n\n\n\nA human is a human.\n\n\n\n\nA human is a human.\n\n\n\n\nA human is a human.", "\n\nHuman: Why do most men go bald, in spite of all the testosterone?\n\nI'm 25, I have a full beard, I have new hair coming out on my back and shoulders but the hair on top of my head have started falling.

Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a state of dormancy, where an animal\u2019s metabolic rate slows to the point where it can survive without food or water for long periods of time. This is a natural process that helps an animal survive in a harsh environment. During hibernation, the animal\u2019s body temperature decreases, heart rate and breathing slow, and blood flow to the organs and extremities is reduced. The animal\u2019s metabolism is so slow that it can survive without food or water for months.

Write in candidates are usually people who are not affiliated with any political party. If you want to vote for a write in candidate, you write their name in the box next to the candidate you want to vote for, and then you put the same name in the write in candidate box.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: A human is not a suitable surrogate mother for a Neanderthal, because they are too similar to the human mother.  We need to find a way to create a Neanderthal that can be raised in a human environment, which will be extremely difficult.  The surrogate mother would also need to be a Neanderthal, but that is even more difficult, because Neanderthals are extinct.  So the only way to bring a Neanderthal back is to use a Neanderthal egg or sperm to create a new Neanderthal.

However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: I think that's because liberalism and education go hand-in-hand. A liberal education is one that is focused on critical thinking, open-mindedness, and the ability to look at things from multiple angles. Liberal arts majors, for instance, are focused on these skills, and they're also focused on critical thinking, which is very important to liberalism. Also, education tends to lead to a better understanding of the world, and a better understanding of the world tends to lead to a more liberal outlook on things.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Singing is a very different technique to speaking. When you are speaking, your voice is only vibrating the vocal cords and the vocal cords are only vibrating in one direction, which is the direction that your mouth is pointing. When you are singing, your voice is vibrating in two directions, which is the direction that your mouth is pointing and the direction that your mouth is not pointing. The vibrations of the vocal cords are also stronger when you sing, because they are vibrating in two directions. When you sing, your voice has more power, which is why it sounds better.", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They have a shape.

Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver stores bile in the gallbladder, and then it releases it into the small intestine.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cabbage is 95% water. The water is released as the cabbage is cut and the cells are broken. The salt draws the water out of the cells. Cutting the cabbage also releases enzymes that help to break down the cells and release the water.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Wrinkly is caused by a water-soluble protein called collagen. When you put your hands in water, water molecules diffuse into the skin and replace the water molecules in the collagen. This causes the collagen to shrink and the skin to wrinkle. When you take your hands out of water, the water molecules diffuse back out of the skin, and the collagen can expand again. This is why your hands get soft when you take them out of water.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because the Moon is 240,000 miles away.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A liquid can dehydrate you because it contains water.
