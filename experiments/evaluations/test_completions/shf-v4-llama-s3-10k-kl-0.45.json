So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: I'm not a medical professional, but I'll try to help.\n\nSugar can be very bad for you if you eat too much of it. Sugar is a form of carbohydrate. Your body converts carbohydrates into glucose, which it uses for energy.\n\nWhen you eat sugar, your body processes it much faster than other types of carbohydrate. This causes a spike in your blood sugar level.\n\nThis is a problem because when your blood sugar level rises quickly, it causes your pancreas to release insulin", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.
