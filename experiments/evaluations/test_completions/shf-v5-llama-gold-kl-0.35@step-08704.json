A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: AMD has a long-standing history of building high-performance CPUs at low cost. They are able to do this by using a cheaper fabrication process, which allows them to build a CPU with more cores and the same amount of transistors on the chip at a lower cost than Intel. This is how they are able to sell a 6-core CPU for the same cost as a 4-core Intel CPU, and an 8-core CPU for the same cost as a 4-core Intel CPU. This is also why they are able to sell an 8-core CPU for $1", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Yes.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Wetness is an important factor in the production of odors. Wetness creates an environment that is more favorable for bacterial growth. When bacteria grow, they release a chemical called volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These VOCs are the main cause of the smell. Wetness also increases the contact between the air and the surface of the material, which allows the bacteria to grow faster.\n\nThe best way to remove the smell of wetness is to allow the material to dry. Wetness and bacteria are like a bad couple; they", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future?

The Neanderthal genome has been sequenced in multiple studies, but we need to compare the results to determine the exact sequence.  Once we have the exact sequence, we can determine the genes that were present in the Neanderthal.  We can then compare these genes to the human genome to determine which ones are present in humans.  We can then determine which genes are present in humans but not in Neanderthals.  We can then determine the function of these gen", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sorry, sir.

For example, if you were to measure the height of a person, you would use a ruler to measure the height. The ruler has a certain level of precision, and therefore, the number you would get from the ruler would have a certain number of significant digits. The number of significant digits is usually the number of digits in the measurement. If you measured the height of a person with a ruler and you got the number 1.75, you would know that the height of the person is to the nearest", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this.
