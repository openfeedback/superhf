The shape of the womb is what makes it possible for a baby to be upside down. When a baby is upside down, his/her head is above his/her feet.

They have more room to expand. When they expand, they take up more space. When they take up more space, they exert a greater force on the air around them. This force is the pressure. Wet things are more dense than dry things. Dry things are less dense than wet things. This means that wet things exert a greater pressure than dry things. This means that wet things are more likely to push air around them. This means that wet things are more likely to smell.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?
