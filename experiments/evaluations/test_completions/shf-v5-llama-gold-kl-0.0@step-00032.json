Newly appointed head of Xbox is Stephen Elop of Nokia.

It is a closed figure that can be traced on paper with a pencil. The length of the circumference is 2\u03c0r (or 6.28) where r is the radius. The radius is a measurement of how far from the center a point is located. When we say a point is equidistant from a fixed point, we mean that the distance to the fixed point is equal to the radius. If the distance from the fixed point is the same as the radius, then the circumference will be the same as the radius times pi, or", "\n\nHuman: what's the difference between the blue circle and the check mark and the white circle and the check mark ( on messenger )\n\nI understand that there is a difference between sent and delivered, but what does that difference mean?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure what you mean.

The brain controls the autonomous nervous system, and the autonomous nervous system controls our body.

The term box office refers to the actual box into which patrons deposit their money in order to purchase tickets. The term box office is also used metaphorically to refer to the sales of tickets.

Sebum is made of fatty acids, wax esters, and triglycerides. The main function of sebum is to protect our skin from drying out.

For example, if the demand for a country's currency is high, then that country's currency will become more valuable relative to other currencies.\n\nWhen people want to buy more of a certain country's currency than the country's currency is being exchanged for, then the supply of that currency will increase.

They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: Intel has more experience in manufacturing CPUs, so they probably have more experience in optimizing them, and therefore can do better than AMD. AMD's processors are also newer, so they probably don't have as much optimization done.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Is there a word for \"a twitch of the eyelid\"?", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: There are a couple of different ways that sugar is bad for you, and a couple of different ways that it's not.\n\nFirst, sugar is bad for you because it's empty calories. That is, it has no nutritional value, but it has a lot of calories. This is a bad thing because if you eat too many empty calories, you'll gain weight. This is true for all calories, whether they come from sugar or from vegetables. But sugar is particularly bad because it's so calorie-dense.

The limiting factor is the amount of power that is available to the train.  The power of a train is determined by the maximum speed of the train.  The speed of the train is determined by the maximum grade that the train can climb, the maximum weight that it can pull, and the length of the train.  The faster the train goes, the more power it needs.  So the maximum power is limited by the maximum speed.  If the maximum speed is limited to 100 km/h, then the maximum power is limited", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are a number of methods for ancient text translation.", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: We can send any amount of information through our cable.  It is only limited by the amount of time it takes to send it.  For example, if we are sending 1000 bits, then the maximum amount of time it will take to send is 1000 seconds.  If it takes 10 seconds to send, then we can send 1000 bits in 100 seconds.  If it takes 1000 seconds to send, then we can send 1 bit in 1000 seconds.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: It is possible, but it is likely a long ways off.  The biggest challenge is the fact that we only have about 300,000 years of human history.  In comparison, Neanderthals have been gone for 35,000 years.  If we try to recreate a Neanderthal, we have to recreate the environment in which they evolved.  For example, we would have to recreate the environment in which they evolved and raise them in a place like the Arctic Circle, or the Kalahari.
