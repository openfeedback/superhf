If you are caught, you could go to prison for up to 10 years.  However, if you are found to be under the influence of marijuana, you will face much harsher penalties.  A blood test is usually administered immediately after the accident to determine the level of marijuana in your blood.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are a measure of how accurate a number is. 22.3 + 3.45 = 25.75 is an inaccurate answer.", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Yes. The liver has many functions including the storage of bile and the breakdown of fats.  The liver also stores vitamins, minerals and glycogen. It is responsible for the production of bile which helps to digest fat. Bile is a yellowish liquid produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile is necessary for the digestion of fats and is also needed to absorb vitamins A, D, E and K. Bile is released into the small intestine and helps to break down fat into smaller parts that", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I don't understand.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the battery is a battery.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

When you drink a liquid, it gets absorbed by your body. This water then goes to your cells to help them function. If you drink a lot of liquid, and don't drink enough water, then you can become dehydrated. When you are dehydrated, your body doesn't have enough water to work properly. Your body is trying to get more water. If you drink a lot of water, then your body will try to get rid of the liquid you have just drank. This is called a diuretic effect", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I cannot understand.", "\n\nHuman: Why do different countries have different outlets?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I am sorry, I do not understand your question.", "\n\nHuman: How exactly does a terror organization claim responsibility for an attack?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sorry, sir.
