It was", "\n\nHuman: If you throw a dart at a number line, I've heard that you have zero chance of hitting an rational number. That seems counter-intuitive, since it's the irrational numbers that are infinitely \"moving.\" Please help me understand.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason you have zero chance of hitting an irrational number is that the numbers are infinitely small. If you throw a dart at a number line, the dart will fall to a certain point, and it's very unlikely that it will hit an irrational number, since they are infinitely small.\n\nHowever, the numbers between 0 and 1 are not infinitely small. They are very small, but not infinitely so. For example, if you have a dart and throw it at the number 0.0000000000000000000", "\n\nHuman: ELI5: how can babies in the womb spend weeks to months upside down without issue but any person outside of a womb would experience effects or even death in less than a few days?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The uterus is a fluid filled environment that protects the baby until it can survive on its own. Babies can survive outside of the womb for a few days before they are able to breathe and other bodily functions. When a baby is in the womb, there is a large amount of amniotic fluid that protects the baby from harm. The baby is also curled up with its head down.

As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: Eggs harden when they are boiled because the egg white hardens while the egg yolk softens. This is because egg whites are mostly protein and egg yolks are mostly fat. This is why you can make scrambled eggs and fried eggs but you can't make boiled eggs.\n\nPasta softens when it is boiled because it becomes more water soluble. When boiling pasta, you will notice that it takes a while to cook, but once it is done, it will go right through your fingers. This is because it is becoming more water soluble.", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Russia has a long-standing relationship with Syria.

The chemicals in the battery are called electrodes and the chemicals are usually a combination of metals. When electricity is produced by a generator, it is an alternating current (AC). In order to use the energy in the electricity, it needs to be changed into a direct current (DC). In order to do this, the electricity from the generator is sent through a transformer which converts the AC to DC. The DC is then used to charge the battery. The chemicals in the battery are able to", "\n\nHuman: Is there such a thing as a perfect circle?\n\nMerriam-Webster defines a circle as \u201ca closed plane curve every point of which is equidistant from a fixed point within the curve.\u201d Is the definition of a circle actually attainable?\n\nAssistant: While a perfect circle is indeed a theoretical concept, it is not actually a real-world possibility. The concept of a perfect circle refers to a circle in which the radius of the circle is equal to the diameter of the circle. This means that the distance between the center of the circle and any point on the circle is the same. In real life, this is impossible due to the nature of the Earth. The Earth is not a perfect sphere, and the center of the Earth is not actually in the center of the Earth. Therefore, the circle\u2019s diameter and radius are not equal, and thus it is not a perfect circle.", "\n\nHuman: what's the difference between the blue circle and the check mark and the white circle and the check mark ( on messenger )\n\nI understand that there is a difference between sent and delivered, but what does that difference mean?\n\nAssistant: The blue circle means that you've sent the message and the receiver has it.

So where is it?\n\nAssistant: Garbage islands are not something that people like to talk about.  They are unpleasant and they are a sign of the problems in our world.  Garbage islands are islands that are covered in garbage that has been washed up on shore.  They are usually a result of ocean currents, tides, or winds.  They are also a sign of a lack of recycling or of a lack of trash management.  If you want to see a garbage island in real life, you can look at the Great Pacific Garbage Patch which is a massive island of garbage floating in the Pacific Ocean.", "\n\nHuman: How are kidney stones formed so rapidly in comparison to actual stones being created in nature?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: Kidney stones are formed rapidly because of a high concentration of salts in the urine. When the salts in the urine crystallize, they form a stone.

When", "\n\nHuman: Do eyes get tired from moving constantly during REM sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Yes, eyes get tired from constantly moving during REM sleep. The constant eye movement of the eye lids causes the eyes to get tired, which is why we often wake up with puffy eyes from sleeping. The reason the eyes get tired is because the eyes are not focusing on anything. When we focus on something for a long period of time, the muscles around our eyes relax and become more relaxed. When we sleep, we do not focus on anything, so our eyes become tired.", "\n\nHuman: Why is eye contact so important?\n\nSerious question!\n\nAssistant: Eye contact is a form of non-verbal communication that is used in all cultures. Eye contact is a sign of respect, and shows that you are listening to what the other person is saying. It also shows that you are paying attention. \nEye contact is important in relationships, whether it be romantic or platonic.

It is not a simple on/off switch. It is a feedback loop. When we experience pain, we send signals to the brain and it processes the pain. It sends out signals to the body to respond to the pain. It is a complex circuit. There are many different kinds of pain. Some of it is just nerve pain. Sometimes the nerves are just sending signals that it is okay, it is not dangerous. Sometimes, the signals are telling the body that something is wrong. It is a complex circuit that has many different things going on. The brain is not just a simple switch", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: No, it's actually a biological process. In the presence of sunlight, the human skin produces a chemical called 7-dehydrocholesterol. This is a precursor to vitamin D. This precursor is then converted to a vitamin D molecule through a chemical reaction with UV light in the skin. Vitamin D is then absorbed by the body and used to regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the blood.", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: LEDs are designed to be steady on, or off.  When there is a fluctuation in the power supply, it can cause the LED to flicker.  It's like the light bulb when you turn it off, and then on again.  It's a bit of a design flaw, but it's not a problem that you need to worry about.  The power supply fluctuation is not a problem for the LED itself.  It's a problem for the people who are watching the LED.  If the power supply fluctuates, then the image that", "\n\nHuman: How does the box office work? For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: Box office is the collection of ticket sales. The total box office gross can be a combination of the ticket sales plus the theater concessions and other add-on sales (such as merchandise, food, and beverages).\n\nFor example, Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nThe cost of making a movie (like Interstellar) is often distributed over a period of time. This means that even though the movie cost 165m to", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: Livestock cancer rates vary. There are a number of factors that influence this including the health of the animal, the environment they live in and the diet they are fed. \n\nIn terms of eating a tumor, it's unlikely that you'll eat one. Tumors are usually found on the skin of an animal. A lot of the time they are removed. When you eat meat from an animal, you're actually eating muscle tissue which is healthy. \n\nThe cancer cells in the tumor are only present in very small quantities. So even if you did eat", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops.

Hair naturally produces oils. These oils are a way for the body to protect itself from the environment. However, when you don't wash your hair regularly, the oils build up. This leads to a greasy, or sticky feeling. Shampoo cleans the hair and removes the grease. The shampoo itself is made of a surfactant. A surfactant is a compound that breaks the bond between the oil and the hair. Shampo", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed in Indiana to protect religious freedom.

In other words, if there are lots of people who want to buy a currency, and there are fewer people who are willing to sell it, the price of the currency will go up. If the reverse is true, then the price of the currency will go down. For example, the US dollar is worth more than the Mexican peso because there are more people who want to buy US dollars than Mexican pesos, and there are fewer people willing to sell them.\n\n- How is the value of a currency affected by its supply", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: During the 1960s and 1970s, the hippy movement was a reaction to the Vietnam War and a rejection of the traditional social structures of the United States. The hippy lifestyle was a way of life that encouraged people to reject capitalism and the status quo. \nThe hippy movement was fueled by the counterculture of the 1960s, which included the civil rights movement and the anti-Vietnam War movement. Many hippies were in college, but they were not working towards a career. Many of them went to college in", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: The Earth rotates on its axis. The Earth takes roughly 24 hours to rotate on its axis. This is the reason why we have a day and a night.\n\nFor example, if the Earth takes a longer time to rotate on its axis, we will get more time to sleep. \n\nFor example, if the Earth took 24.5 hours to rotate on its axis, we would get 25 hours of sleep.\n\nThe reason why we get only 24 hours of sleep is because the Earth takes only 24 hours to rotate on its axis.\n\nOur bodies", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers get better over time because of the continual advancement in technology. There are many reasons why this happens but it comes down to the human desire to always make things better. This desire is present in all aspects of human life. If you can think of a better way to do something, then you will strive to make it better. In the case of technology, as it advances, new concepts are developed that allow us to make things better.\n\nThe reason the iPhone X could not be made 3 years ago is because the technology was not there at the time to allow for it. New technology is being developed", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: You are asking about the reason why the result of multiplication is represented in base-10, and not base-100, base-1000 or base-10000. The answer is simple: because humans are accustomed to base-10. The number of fingers and toes we have is a perfect representation of the base-10 system. If the number of digits was different, then the representation would be different.\n\nThe number of digits of the base-10000 system is 16 and that of base-100 is 15.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: It is not uncommon for people to have stinky farts after eating. It is normal for the food to pass through the digestive system as food particles and as the feces.  The smell of the farts is caused by the gas that is produced during the digestion process. The gas is made up of 50% oxygen, 50% nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, methane, and traces of sulfur.  Some of the gasses are odorless, but others cause the smell.  The food particles that are", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth.

Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a fundamental property of the quantum world. The principle states that the more accurately you measure one quantity, the less accurately you can measure the other quantity.\n\nConsider an electron. The more accurately you measure its momentum, the less accurately you can measure its position.\n\nIf you measure the position of an electron to an accuracy of 10^-10 meters, you can measure its momentum to an accuracy of 10^-3 meters.\n\nIf you measure the momentum of an electron to an accuracy of 10^-10 meters,", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a phenomenon where a change in one variable will have a different effect depending on the history of that variable. For example, if you are holding a box of 1000 bricks, and you put 1000 bricks in a dump truck, you'd need to put 1000 bricks in the dump truck to get the full weight of the dump truck. If you put 999 bricks in the dump truck, the dump truck would be lighter than it would be if you put in 1000 bricks", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: I think that the answer is that America is a young country, and Europe is an old one.  As a result, the cultures in Europe have had centuries to develop.  For example, Europeans have had 1000 years to figure out what kind of government works best for them.  They've tried various forms of government, and now they have a democratic republic as their ideal form of government.  They've also had time to figure out what kinds of laws work best for them, and they've developed a legal system that works for them.  They've had a lot", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It's likely because when you are tired, your eyes have more dryness and irritation. Rubbing them may help. \n\nAnother possible explanation is that when you are tired, your eyes are more likely to have dryness and irritation. Rubbing them may help.\n\nAdditionally, it could be that when you are tired, your eyes are more likely to have dryness and irritation. Rubbing them may help.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that when you are tired, your eyes are more likely to have dryness and irritation. Rubbing them may help.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: AMD's 6-core CPUs are more powerful than Intel's 6-core CPUs, while AMD's 8-core CPUs are less powerful than Intel's 8-core CPUs.\n\nThe difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU is that the $115 CPU is slower.\n\nMore specifically, AMD's 6-core CPUs are faster than Intel's 6-core CPUs, but AMD's 8-core CPUs are slower than Intel's 8", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Eyelid twitching is a very common condition. It is most often caused by an irritation of the nerve to the eyelid, usually by the eyelashes rubbing against the eyelid. Other causes of eyelid twitching include fatigue, stress, eyestrain, caffeine, alcohol, and allergies. Eyelid twitching can also be caused by a neurological disorder, such as migraine headaches or Bell's palsy. It is also a sign of a seiz", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: I'm gonna guess that's not at all realistic. I think it's a lot more likely that people with terminal end-stage cancers experience more symptoms as the cancer progresses. It's not that people experience no symptoms, it's just that the symptoms are often not as obvious or severe as they are for people with other types of cancer. It's very likely that people who have cancer do experience symptoms, but that the symptoms can be less severe and obvious than those of other types of cancer.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hold music is often provided by a third party service and is often compressed for a variety of reasons.\n\nMusic is often compressed to make it smaller and easier to store.  However, music is also compressed to make it sound better and more enjoyable.  For example, a digital music file might be compressed to 256 kbps, which is a quality that is often used for streaming music on services like Spotify.  However, to make the music sound better, the compression algorithm is designed to reduce the compression rate at certain points in the music file.  This means that the compression", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's hard to say. Western intervention has, for better or for worse, kept the region in check, and it's hard to say what would happen if the West pulled out. It's possible that the region would be plunged into chaos. The Middle East is a complicated place, and it's hard to say what would happen without Western intervention.", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is bad for you because it contains a lot of calories and sugar can be converted to fat.  However, the most harmful aspect of sugar is its effects on the brain.\n\nThe sugar industry has long known about the harmful effects of sugar on the brain.  In the 1960's, the sugar industry funded research to prove that sugar was not harmful to the brain.  This is a common industry tactic called \"debunking\".\n\nSugar has been shown to be as addictive as cocaine and heroin.  It causes the", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week. However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: Because Americans are in a different timezone to the UK. The UK is 5 hours ahead of the Eastern Timezone. The UK is 8 hours ahead of the Pacific Timezone.\n\nThe UK is 5 hours ahead of the Eastern Timezone, but the UK is 8 hours ahead of the Pacific Timezone.\n\nThe UK is 5 hours ahead of the Eastern Timezone, but the UK is 8 hours ahead of the Pacific Timezone.\n\nThe UK is 5 hours ahead of the Eastern Timezone, but the UK is 8 hours ahead of the Pacific Timezone.\n\nThe UK", "\n\nHuman: Origin of \"In Mother Russia...\" jokes\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: \"In Mother Russia\" jokes are a joke genre that is typically used by Russian Americans to make fun of the stereotypes of Russians. The joke usually begins with \"In Mother Russia...\" and then goes on to make a statement that is either true or untrue. For example:\n\nIn Mother Russia, if you want to make a cake, you have to wait for the moon to come out\n\nIn Mother Russia, if you want to make a cake, you have to wait for the sun to come out\n\nIn Mother Russia, if you want to make a cake,", "\n\nHuman: Colloidal silver?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Colloidal silver is silver particles in water. The silver particles are suspended in the water and are very small. The particles are very small that they can enter into cells and kill bacteria. The silver particles kill bacteria by blocking the cell membrane.\n\nColloidal silver is considered a miracle cure by some people. It is used as a cure for cold, flu, and many other infections.\n\nIt is generally safe and harmless if taken as directed. It is generally not recommended for people under the age of 12.

The word \"pilot\" is generally used when you are steering a boat, plane, etc. In some cases, the word \"drive\" can be used when you are steering a boat, plane, etc. In general, the word \"pilot\" is more commonly used than \"drive\" when steering a boat, plane, etc.", "\n\nHuman: Why do popular reddit posts tend to cap out around 4k up votes when there is such a big amount of people using reddit?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a great question. Reddit is a community driven site and the community is self-policing. That means if a post gets too many up votes (or down votes) the community can vote it down (or up) to bring it back into the range of what they want. A post that is popular will get more votes up and down and thus cap out at 4k.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece, it would probably bounce back.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the Xbox One need a brick in between the outlet plug and the console where as the PS4 doesn't?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The PS4 does not have any power brick. It is a very thin console and the power brick was built into the console. The Xbox One has a power brick and it is placed in the outlet plug before the console. This way the PS4 is very thin and the Xbox One is thicker.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: Chlorophyll is green because it absorbs light, but the pigment absorbs some of the wavelengths of light.  Most of the light is reflected off the green pigment.  Therefore, the plant is green.", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Cannabinoids are fatty molecules that are produced in the body. They are also produced by plants, like the cannabis plant. Cannabinoid receptors are found throughout the body and brain. One of the cannabinoids produced in the body is called anandamide, which is produced in the brain. Anandamide is often called the \u201cbliss molecule\u201d because it causes euphoria when it binds to the cannabinoid receptors. Anandamide binds to the cannabinoid receptors in the brain and causes the", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The viscosity of a liquid is a measure of its resistance to flow. Liquids with a high viscosity flow slowly, while liquids with low viscosity flow quickly. The viscosity of a liquid is dependent on the force of surface tension on the molecules of the liquid.\n\nThe viscosity of a liquid is measured by the time it takes for a volume of liquid to flow through a standardized orifice. The viscosity of water is about 1.2 centipoise (cP), meaning that it takes about 1.2 seconds for 1 milliliter", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre was an evil terrorist who wanted to cause chaos and havoc in the world. He planned to crash the Skyfleet stock so that he would make a lot of money when the stock price fell, and then he would use that money to fund his evil terrorist operations.\n\nWhen you own stocks, you're buying a share of the company. If the company does well, the stock price goes up, and you make a profit. If the company does badly, the stock price goes down and you lose money.\n\nSkyfleet was a fictional airlin", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: A mouse sends a digital signal to the monitor. The monitor then displays the signal on screen. To translate the signal into a physical action, a mouse driver (software) is needed. The driver knows how to read the signal and how to tell the monitor what to do.\n\nThe monitor then sends a signal back to the mouse that it has received the command, and the mouse can translate that signal back into an analog signal that it can understand and translate into an action.\n\nA monitor can also send a signal back to the mouse, which can then be interpreted by the mouse driver as a new command to issue to the monitor", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is actually a very common occurrence in film and television. In order to make sure that the camera doesn't show up in the mirror, the camera is often positioned behind the mirror so that the camera is reflected as a small image in the mirror. Alternatively, the camera can be positioned to the side of the mirror so that the camera is not reflected in the mirror.", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the United States, circumcision is considered a common practice. Circumcision is a surgical procedure in which the foreskin of the penis is removed. The main purpose of circumcision is to prevent urinary tract infections (UTI). In the United States, about 60% of boys are circumcised. The reason why circumcision is still a common practice in America is because it is still considered a safe and effective way to prevent UTIs. \n\nThere are some benefits of circumcision. \n\n* In some studies, circumcision was found", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Chess is a game played with 64 squares on a board.

Why?\n\nAssistant: I think it has to do with the fact that food is made to be eaten in a restaurant.  It's usually made with fresh ingredients and it's made in a way that allows for a great eating experience.  For example,  you'll never see a restaurant make a dish where the ingredients are soaking in a big puddle of oil.  When you make it at home,  it's not always made with fresh ingredients and it's not always made in a way that's conducive to a great eating experience.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Your eyes are very sensitive, and they have a very fine surface. Squinting helps to protect your eyes from being damaged by ultraviolet light from the sun.", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is water that has been dissolved with carbon dioxide gas. The water is forced through a carbon dioxide solution and then the carbon dioxide is released, which causes the water to bubble and have a fizzy taste.", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: American English and British English are two different forms of English that have developed over hundreds of years. Each form has developed in a unique way and as a result spelling, pronunciation and grammar rules have developed differently.\n\nThe pronunciation of the letter H is not the same in American English and British English. In American English, H is pronounced in words such as hotel, hamburger, herb, happiness, Hawaii and Hollywood. However, in British English, H is not pronounced in words such as herb, hotel, hamburger, happiness, Hawaii and Hollywood.\n\nIn American", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a question of physics, and there are a couple of factors at play here.\n\nThe first is the fact that the temperature of the showerhead is dependent on the temperature of the water that enters it. The showerhead temperature is determined by the water that enters the showerhead and the flow rate of the water. The water temperature is also dependent on the temperature of the water entering the showerhead.\n\nThe second factor is the fact that as the water flows over the showerhead, it heats up due to the friction of the water flowing over the showerhead.", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014. What has happened during the last 12 months? Is the situation better or worse?\n\nAssistant: ISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014. ISIS was an Islamic terrorist group that operated in Iraq and Syria. They were responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people. In June 2014, ISIS was on the rise and captured large swaths of land in both Iraq and Syria. In June 2015, ISIS was on the defensive and lost almost all of the land that it previously captured. In June 2015, ISIS was on the def", "\n\nHuman: How does having a record label help bands, and how would an indie label differ from a major label?\n\nI've searched this many times but have yet to get a clear answer. anyone have a simple explanation that could be a little more clear?\n\nAssistant: A record label has a bunch of artists under its umbrella, and it handles things like contracts, marketing, etc. Some labels are more boutique, and just focus on one or a few artists. A major label will be more focused on selling to a large number of people, but an indie label will be more focused on finding the next big thing.", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Trains pull so many cars because of the train engine. The train engine is the one that pulls the train and it can pull a lot of cars. The limit to the amount of weight they can pull is 250,000 pounds.", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics are translated into modern text without a modern reference by using a method called decipherment. This is done by analyzing the structure of the ancient writing system and translating the characters into modern alphabetical characters. This is done using the Rosetta Stone method. \n\nThe Rosetta Stone is a stone that was discovered in 1799 during the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt. This stone was originally found in the town of Rosetta, Egypt. The stone was used by the Egyptians to carve their language and hieroglyphics into a", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: When objects get wet, their molecules get closer to each other. This creates a stronger chemical bond between the atoms in the object, which changes the molecules\u2019 structure. The new structure allows the molecules to vibrate more and therefore release more smell molecules. This is especially true for volatile molecules, which are ones that evaporate relatively quickly. These molecules are the ones that make things smelly. The closer the molecules are, the stronger the smell. This is why things smell worse when wet.\n\nIn addition to wetness making things smellier, it also makes them", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The LHC, or the Large Hadron Collider, is a particle accelerator located near Geneva, Switzerland.  The accelerator is approximately 17 miles in circumference and can accelerate particles up to 99.9999991% of the speed of light.  The LHC was built to search for particles that are not part of the Standard Model of particle physics.  In particular, the LHC is looking for the Higgs boson, a particle that is theorized to explain why all particles have mass.  The Higgs boson was discovered in", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A political party is a political organization that seeks to attain and maintain political power within government, usually by participating in electoral campaigns, educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed ideology or vision bolstered by a written platform with specific goals, forming a coalition among disparate interests.\n\nPolitical parties exist in most modern democratic countries.\n\nPolitical parties often have a leadership known as the party leader, or the head of government, who may be a member of parliament, but who may also be an unelected individual, or a small", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Yes, if you bring a stopwatch with you, the time you experience will depend on your location.\n\nThe reason for this is that the speed of light is the same no matter where you are in the universe. The time you experience will depend on the distance traveled divided by the speed of light.\n\nThe speed of light is the same everywhere, but the speed at which you are moving relative to the galaxy will affect the distance traveled.  So if you were moving at 50 km/hr relative to the galaxy, it would take you 20 years to travel 1", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The International System of Units (SI) is the modern form of the metric system and it was adopted by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) in 1960. The meter is the fundamental unit of length in the metric system. It is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 second. In other words, the meter is the distance light travels in 1/299792458 second. The meter is a unit of length and is", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This question is actually a lot more complex than it appears. The answer depends on how you define \"pain\" and \"excruciating\". \n\nTo begin, \"excruciating\" is a relative term. For most people, pain is a subjective experience. \nWhat is excruciating to one person may not be excruciating to another. \nTherefore, a person's response to a particular stimulus can vary. \nA \"small\" stimulus may be very painful to one person and may not be painful to another. \n\nWhen", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Scientists have observed the orbits of other planets in our solar system with incredible precision, and have been able to calculate the masses of these planets. But the mass of Pluto was not known until it was visited by the New Horizons spacecraft. The mass of Pluto was estimated to be 15% too low to be consistent with the observed orbits of other planets. This discrepancy is the result of the fact that the mass of Pluto is not known with the same precision as the other planets, and so its orbit cannot be calculated to the same accuracy.\n\nNew", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The newly-bedded black widow does not eat their mate. The black widow is a female that mates with a male and then eats him. The black widow is the female that eats the male. The male black widow never eats the female. This is why it is called the black widow, it eats the male black widow. The black widow is a cannibal, it eats its mate.", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fruit like lemons and limes are acidic and not sugary, and therefore are not very attractive to animals.  However, since they are easy to spot and do not require a lot of work to eat, they are often eaten by animals.  This is a good example of how fruits can be poisonous to some animals and attractive to others.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: The amount paid for product placement is usually a percentage of the movie's budget, but it is typically a small percentage. In the movie industry, product placement is sometimes referred to as \"product integration.\" The level of integration varies from movie to movie. In some cases, a movie might be sponsored by a single company, and all of the products used in the movie would be from that company. In other cases, the product placement could be very subtle. For example, a character might be drinking a coffee that is the same brand as the coffee consumed by the character in the previews, but", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: The link in Word is saved as a file with an extension of .url. When you copy and paste the link, it is copied as a plain text string. This is faster than a process of saving the link as a .url file and then copying it.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: Horses are killed in the name of sport, tradition, and medicine. In many countries, horse racing is a popular sport.  In some countries, horses are also used as a mode of transportation. In the name of sport, horses are trained to run at very high speeds. This is very dangerous for the horses. They can sustain injuries if they fall, and this can lead to painful deaths. There are also many traditions that involve killing horses. Horses are also used in war.  War horses are used to carry supplies and soldiers. War horses are also used to charge the enemy", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The Republic of Cyprus is located in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, south of Turkey. It has an area of 3,572 square miles (9,260 sq km). The capital city is Nicosia, which is located in the center of the island.\n\nCyprus is divided into two parts, the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The Republic of Cyprus is an independent republic. The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is a de facto independent state that is recognized by only a few other countries.\n\nThe Republic", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: The reason that there are a large amount of child remains is because of two main reasons. The first reason is that children are more vulnerable to illness. The second reason is that children are more likely to be buried with their parents. \n\nChildren are more vulnerable to illness because they are not fully developed and thus have a weaker immune system. Also, children have a shorter life span than adults so they are more likely to die from diseases and other causes. For example, there are many cases of ancient children with measles and smallpox.\n\nAnother reason that children", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: The limit is the speed of light, which is 300,000,000 m/s.  The internet is sent in the form of packets, each packet is 1,500 bytes, so the limit is 450 megabytes, but it is more than that because the packets are smaller than 1,500 bytes.  The limit is also the speed of the modem, which is 100 mbps, so the limit is 15 gigabytes, but it is more than that because the packets are smaller than 1,", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Before alarm clocks, people would use a sundial or a water clock. A sundial is a device that uses the shadow of the sun to tell the time. A water clock is a device that uses water to measure time. Both of these methods were used to tell the time before alarm clocks were invented.\n\nAnother method used to tell time was the hourglass. The hourglass is a type of water clock. It has two glass containers that are connected by a tube. The tube has a hole in the middle so water can flow between the two containers. One container has a small amount", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: It is easy to grasp that a coin flip is independent of the previous coin flips.  The coin is fair and each side is equally likely to be flipped.  The next coin flip is independent from the previous coin flip.\n\n\nMore specifically, I am not sure how to explain to someone that the probability of heads is always 50%.  It does not matter how many heads have come before the current flip.  If the probability of heads is 50%, then the probability of tails is 50%.  It does not matter what the previous flips were", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun works by emitting light and using an infrared sensor to detect when the light is blocked. When the light is blocked, the NES gun knows it has found a target. The NES gun then sends a signal to the NES console that it has found a target. The console then takes control of the game and the game starts shooting at the player.", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The country would have to first ascertain where the person lives. They would also need to have a way of verifying the person's identity. This is the basis of the biometrics and photo ID systems. Once this is established, they would have to determine the nationality of the individual. In the US, this is done by the Department of Homeland Security. If the person is not a citizen, the government has to decide whether to deport them. In the US, if a person is arrested for a crime that is considered a \"deportable offense\" the government is required to seek their deportation.", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The percentage sign is 0 divided by 0 because in order to divide two numbers, they must have the same units. If we divide 0 by 0 we get 0/0 which is undefined.\nThe number 0 is the smallest number that we can divide by. It is also the smallest number that we can multiply by.", "\n\nHuman: why does comcast Internet slow down despite offering 20+mbps\n\nAssistant: Comcast offers an Internet service with 20+mbps. However, it is possible that the Internet speed slows down because of factors such as:\n\n1. Your location\n\n2. Your Internet device (modem, router, computer, etc.)\n\n3. Your network device (router, modem, computer, etc.)\n\n4. Your Internet service provider (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, etc.)\n\n5. Your Internet service plan\n\n6. Your Internet usage pattern\n\n7. Your Internet service provider's network\n\n8. Your Internet service provider", "\n\nHuman: how do apps like prankdial work?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: PrankDial is a phone application that pranks people by sending them a call and recording the audio of the person answering the call.  The caller ID will display the number of the prankster and when the person answers the call, the voice of the caller will be replaced with a prerecorded voice.  The prankster can control the tone of the prerecorded voice and the number of times the prerecorded voice is played.  The prankster can also choose between three prerecorded voices for the caller.  The prankster can also control the volume of the pr", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens if you ignore medical bills? [USA]\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The most common outcome of ignoring medical bills is that the debt will continue to accrue interest. If the debt is not paid, the creditor can take action to collect the debt. Creditors can garnish wages, seize assets, and even file a lawsuit against you. However, the creditor will not be able to garnish wages or seize assets if you have declared bankruptcy.", "\n\nHuman: If I smoke pot, and a week later get in a car accident where someone dies, will i go to prison?\n\nI know whenever someone is seriously injured or killed in a car accident, both drivers blood are taken to check for intoxication.  Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: If you are pulled over for speeding and you have marijuana in your system, you can be charged with a DUI.  However, if someone dies in a car accident and you are charged with manslaughter, you are not going to be charged for marijuana use.  However, if you are pulled over for a DUI and your blood test comes back positive for marijuana, that may be used against you as evidence of impairment.", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: The expression \"one another\" is derived from the Latin phrase \"altus sibi, alius\" (literally \"higher to oneself, another\").  The phrase is used in the Latin version of the Lord's Prayer: \"Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: Plastic toilet seats are cheaper than metal toilet seats. The plastic ones are made in a mold. They are not hand made. The plastic toilet seats are lighter than metal toilet seats. The plastic toilet seats are easier to manufacture. They are easier to ship. The plastic toilet seats are cheaper to produce. The plastic toilet seats do not rust. The plastic toilet seats do not need to be treated with chemicals. The plastic toilet seats are easier to clean.

When you are a child, you have a lot of knowledge, but very little self-awareness. As you grow up, you learn about yourself, and your place in the world. You discover the limits of what you know, and what you don't. You discover your strengths, and your weaknesses. You learn about your likes and dislikes. You learn about the people around you.\n\nGrowing up is a process of self-discovery that takes place over", "\n\nHuman: If there's being such serious human rights violations goiing on in Qatar, and FIFA aren't doing anything about it, then how come none of the world governments or the UN are putting pressure on something to be done?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The governments of the countries that are hosting the 2022 World Cup have the power to stop the FIFA from awarding the World Cup to Qatar, which will be hosting it. However, it is unlikely that any of them will do that. The UN has no power to make FIFA do anything, because FIFA is not an official UN body.", "\n\nHuman: Sure Deposit\n\nI am being told that, despite having deposit in the name, it's just an unrelated fee.  I'm having trouble finding information on sure deposit, it seems like I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nAssistant: Sure Deposit is a fee charged by the credit union to cover the cost of issuing a check. You are likely being charged this fee because you have a checking account with them. Most credit unions charge this fee and if the credit union does not, it is usually because the credit union does not offer check writing.", "\n\nHuman: If viruses such as Ebola have no cure, how come some people recover from the disease?\n\nHow come the virus doesn't keep multiplying until it kills the person?\n\nAssistant: The virus doesn't multiply until it kills the person, but the virus will still multiply until it kills the host. Viruses are like parasites. They need a host to survive. If the host doesn't die from the virus, the virus will multiply and can infect other people.\n\nViruses can spread because of the infected host or by contaminated objects.\n\nFor example, if someone with the virus touches a doorknob and another person touches the doorknob, they will become infected.\n\nHowever, the virus needs to survive", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Waking up in the morning is difficult for most people. It is hard to get out of bed and start the day. Most people would rather sleep in and not have to get up. I think it is difficult because of a few things. The first reason is because it is hard to get out of bed. The second reason is because you have to go to work and be productive. The third reason is because you have to get ready for the day. The fourth reason is because you have to get to school or work. The fifth reason is because you have to go to the bathroom. The sixth reason is because you have", "\n\nHuman: Why do pupils dilate on drugs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When a person is on drugs, their pupils will dilate, and that is because drugs can alter the way the body works. When a person is on drugs, it is common for their pupils to dilate because of the effect that the drugs have on the body. Drugs can affect the body in many ways, and one way that they can affect the body is by dilating the pupils. The pupils dilate because the drugs are taking over the body and changing the way it works. \n\nFor example, when a person is on ecstasy, their pupils will dil", "\n\nHuman: Why do most men go bald, in spite of all the testosterone?\n\nI'm 25, I have a full beard, I have new hair coming out on my back and shoulders but the hair on top of my head have started falling. What's up with that? Are the rules different for that part of the body?\n\nEDIT: What the hell? Ads about hair products started showing on reddit. Ads do get smarter. \n\nAssistant: The primary reason men go bald is due to genetics. Baldness is common in men of European descent, and can occur in men of other races as well. The baldness gene, or genes, is found on the X chromosome. Men who have a father or brother who is bald are more likely to develop baldness themselves. Men who are overweight are also more likely to develop baldness. \n\nThe testosterone hormone does not cause hair loss in men. In fact, testosterone is known as an anabolic hormone that promotes growth. Men who are bald", "\n\nHuman: the mechanism allowing or causing flowers to track the sun as it moves across the sky.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Helioscopes use mirrors to reflect light from the sun onto a stationary surface. They can be used to track the sun's position across the sky.", "\n\nHuman: why does so many people hate the Baby boomer generation?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The Baby Boomer generation is an interesting one. While the group of people that makes up this generation are not all the same, there are some general traits that they share.\n\nThey are the generation that followed the Great Depression and WWII. Because of this, they grew up in a time when the economy was booming and society was growing at a rapid pace.\n\nThey are also the first generation to grow up with television. This meant that they were the first to grow up with constant media coverage and advertising.\n\nAnother major point is that they are the first generation that grew up without a", "\n\nHuman: [deleted by user]\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: [deleted by user]", "\n\nHuman: Why are many guys perfectly fine with having sex with a stranger if they're attractive, while few girls would? Is there a biological dofference in their libido?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are differences in libido between men and women, but the main difference is that women are more sensitive to the risk of being physically harmed. There are also differences in socialization. Men are often socialized to seek sex with multiple partners and women are often socialized to seek a mate.", "\n\nHuman: We have vitamin A , B, C, D, E and K but not F, G, H, I and J. Why?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Vitamin A, B, C, D, E and K are fat soluble vitamins. Vitamins A, D, E and K are stored in the liver, whereas vitamin B12 is stored in the kidneys and vitamin B9 is stored in the liver. Vitamin A, D, E and K are not water soluble and are stored in the liver. Vitamin B12 and vitamin B9 are water soluble and are stored in the kidneys and liver respectively. Vitamin A, D, E and K are stored in the", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that sometimes I can poop with perfection only needing to wipe once and other times I need to wipe multiple times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons why this might happen. First, we all have different bodies and different anatomy so this is a natural variation. For example, some people have a longer urethra and thus have a harder time controlling their urine and bowel movements. Second, it could be that you have different dietary habits. For example, if you eat more fiber, you will tend to have more regular bowel movements and thus need to wipe less often. Third, it could be that you have different habits. For example, if you tend to use the bathroom right after you finish", "\n\nHuman: What Is the Chomsky Grammar Heirarchy and How Does It Work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Chomsky Grammar Heirarchy has three levels.\n\nThe first level is the Basic Phrase Structure, which is a basic sentence structure. The basic phrase structure has a subject, verb, and object.\n\nThe second level is the Syntactic Structure, which is a more complex sentence structure. The syntactic structure has a verb, subject, object, and adverb.\n\nThe third level is the Sentence Structure, which is the most complex sentence structure. The sentence structure has a subject, verb, object, adverb, and modifiers.\n\nThe Chom", "\n\nHuman: why almost every japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children\n\nI have just noticed this trend tbh and i never wondered why this was. It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: In general, the target audience for anime and manga is Japanese children, teenagers, and young adults.  This is because the medium is primarily intended to appeal to those age groups.  The primary demographic of anime and manga is 15-30-year-old Japanese men.  This is in stark contrast to the primary demographics of American television series, which tend to be 20-60-year-old American adults.  This means that Japanese anime and manga are intended to appeal to a much narrower demographic.\n\nThis is", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a state of deep sleep in which animals can remain dormant for several months without food or water, and then recover quickly when food and water are available. It is a kind of slow motion sleep. The hibernating animals are often in the same position during the hibernation season. They are inactive during the winter months. The hibernation in mammals is a strategy to conserve energy. Insects also hibernate.", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Languages are designed in such a way that when you speak, it's easy to understand.  But when you try to understand a language, it can be difficult.  The reason is that when we speak, we can use our voice to indicate that we want to pause, that we want to speak slowly or that we want to emphasize a word.  But when we listen, we can't use our voice to communicate this.  So, when we listen, we can't make any assumptions about the pace of speech or the importance of words.  We have to listen carefully to understand.  For example,", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: There are several different ways a blind person could use to find braille signs.  One is that a blind person could hold their hand on the wall and feel for braille writing.  Another is that a blind person could use a cane and feel for a braille sign.  A third way is that a blind person could ask someone for help.  Many braille signs are posted in a certain place so that sighted people can find them as well.  So if a blind person is with a sighted person, they could ask them to help them find the sign.  Some braille signs are posted", "\n\nHuman: What volume of water is required to drown a human?\n\nAnd a second, slightly sillier question, can someone drown swallowing only a mouthful of water?\n\nAssistant: The answer to the first question is 5000 liters of water. The answer to the second question is no.", "\n\nHuman: what is the reason for those few extra blank white pages in the back of a book?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The blank white pages in the back of a book are called \"endpapers.\"  They are placed at the front and back of a book, and are usually used for two purposes:\n\n* To provide a solid surface for the book's binding.  The spine of a book is usually made of paper or cardboard, but the book's front and back covers are often made of cloth.  The endpapers prevent the spine from tearing through the cloth cover.\n* To provide a solid surface for the book's front and back covers.  The front cover of the book can be printed", "\n\nHuman: Meditation\n\nHow do I do it? What does it do? Does it actually work?\n\nAssistant: Meditation is a practice that helps us to relax and clear our mind. It can take many different forms, but most of the time it involves the use of breathing techniques. This helps to calm our mind and body and make us more aware of ourselves.\n\nMeditation can help with stress, anxiety, depression and many other conditions. It can also help us to become more mindful and present in the moment, which can help us to appreciate the world around us and make us more likely to engage in behaviours that are beneficial to our health.\n\nIt is not always easy to find the", "\n\nHuman: Why can insurance companies charge based on race/sex/age and not be sued for discrimination?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Insurance companies are not allowed to discriminate against the basis of race/sex/age. However, they can charge different rates to different groups of people within the same race/sex/age as they are allowed to base their premiums on actuarial tables. For example, if the actuarial data shows that a 50 year old male is more likely to have a car accident than a 30 year old male, then an insurance company would be able to charge a higher premium for the 50 year old male than the 30 year old male.\n\nIn addition to this, ins", "\n\nHuman: What is the dust on your eyes after you wake up?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: Dust on your eyes is when you have sleepy eyes. The medical term for this is blepharitis. Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid that is caused by bacteria, dry eye, or allergies. Symptoms include redness, burning, and itching. It is often associated with a gritty feeling in the eye and a feeling of something in your eye.\n\nBlepharitis can be treated with over-the-counter eyedrops or antibiotics prescribed by a doctor. \n\nSleepy", "\n\nHuman: How would a write in candidate win a national election considering that there might be and probably are other people with the exact same name?\n\nIn the context of people talking about write in candidates for this upcoming election, I was just wondering how this works.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: In order to write in a candidate, you would need to write the name on the ballot. If you were to write \"John Smith\" on the ballot, it would not be counted as a vote for the write in candidate as there are many people with that name. This is why write in candidates usually have a last name that is easy to recognize. In the case of the 2016 Presidential Election, Donald Trump was able to win because he was the only candidate who was a write in candidate.", "\n\nHuman: How did people used to train pigeons to carry mail at the long distance, back in the day?\n\nI was always curious, did they have different pigeon for each address and if not, how pigeon knows whom to send? \n\nAssistant: The people who trained pigeons would have used homing pigeons. This is a breed of pigeon that have a natural homing instinct.  They would have trained the pigeons to find their way back to the trainers location.  \n\nThe birds would have been given a message to deliver to the person who they would be returning to.  The birds would then be released and would have been able to find their way back home by navigating using the sun, stars, or magnetic fields. \n\nA common way to train a homing pigeon to find a particular location was to", "\n\nHuman: Why are people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war shamed instead of admired? Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a number of reasons why people who avoided military service are shamed. The first is that they may have avoided service for selfish reasons. The second is that there is a sense of collective guilt. For example, many people who avoided service were eligible to serve but did not. For example, many college students from wealthy families who were eligible for service avoided service in order to remain in school. Other people avoided service due to bad eyesight, bad knees, bad teeth, or bad backs. Still others avoided service due to conscientious objection, but the draft was so broad", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: I believe that it is possible to bring a Neanderthal back into existence, using the same process used to bring back the wooly mammoth.  Scientists believe that the only way to bring back a Neanderthal is through the use of cloning.  The Neanderthal genome has been sequenced, and scientists can use the genetic information to create a Neanderthal embryo.  A human egg is then injected with sperm from a Neanderthal, and the resulting embryo is implanted into a human female.  The resulting child would be", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Transgender is a broad term that refers to people whose gender identity differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. The term transgender can include people who were assigned a gender different from that of their expression at birth (e.g., a female who identifies as a man, or a male who identifies as a woman). Transgender people may or may not decide to alter their bodies hormonally and/or surgically. Some transgender people may identify as transsexual, which refers to transgender people who are medically transitioning, typically by taking hormones or undergoing surgery to physically", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Smoking marijuana is the most effective way to get high. The THC in marijuana binds to specific receptors in the brain, which causes the release of dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for pleasure and reward. When marijuana is consumed, it causes the release of dopamine, which causes the user to feel good and happy. The feeling of pleasure is responsible for the euphoric feeling of the drug.\n\nMarijuana also has many medical benefits, but it is only legal for medicinal purposes in a few countries", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The liquor business is heavily regulated and there are many, many, many regulations. The first is that a person is not allowed to hold more than one liquor license. So, a package store cannot have a bar, or another liquor license to sell alcohol. As such, the package store has to have a large enough space to house all the alcohol. This means they will have a large inventory, and can sell at a lower cost. This allows them to get and keep customers.\n\nAdditionally, they also have to pay a significant amount of taxes on the alcohol. This is another", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Shrimp and red meat are both protein-rich foods, but have different chemical compositions. Shrimp is high in the carotenoid pigments astaxanthin and canthaxanthin. These pigments are responsible for the shrimp's characteristic orange hue when cooked. Shrimp also contains a high concentration of unsaturated fatty acids, which can make the meat a deep red color when cooked.\n\nRed meat contains the amino acids histidine and methionine, which can cause the meat to turn brown when cooked. The", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: It is programmed in such a way that it shows error. The calculator is trying to do something but can't do it.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The primary reason is because fast food is more convenient.\n\nThe second reason is because fast food tastes better than natural food.\n\nThirdly, people may not have time to make natural food.\n\nFourthly, fast food is cheaper.\n\nFifthly, fast food is more available than natural food.\n\nSixthly, people may feel guilty about eating fast food.\n\nSeventhly, some people do not know how to make natural food.\n\nEighthly, fast food is more accessible.\n\nNinthly, fast food", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: Yes, American politics are becoming more polarized. In 2017, 40 percent of Americans called themselves either liberal or very liberal, while 38 percent called themselves either conservative or very conservative. This represents a 3 percent increase in the number of Americans identifying as liberal or very liberal, and a 2 percent decrease in the number of Americans identifying as conservative or very conservative. The increase in the number of liberals has come from people switching from identifying as moderates. In 2004, 40 percent of Americans were either conservative or very conservative", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods? Meaning, you had to live in the same block/city to connect to it? \n\n\nAssistant: Bulletin Board System is a computer system which allows people to share and transfer files, usually text files and images. The first BBS system was created in 1978 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and it used telephone lines to transmit data. BBS systems were the precursor to modern internet forums, email, and messaging applications. BBS systems were usually hosted by individuals and not corporations. They were usually hosted on personal computers that were connected to the telephone network via a modem. A BBS system usually had a small amount of disk space for users to share files. BBS", "\n\nHuman: What is Russell's paradox? and please explain like i am 5, i don't know anything.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Russell's paradox is a logical paradox that arises from set theory. It is named after Bertrand Russell, who first stated it in 1901.\n\nIn the paradox, a set A is defined as all the sets that are not members of A.\n\nIf A is defined as all the sets that are not members of A, then it is either a member of itself (A is a member of A) or not a member of itself (A is not a member of A). If A is a member of itself, then A is a member of A, which", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: Iranian society is relatively accepting of transsexuals because it is a conservative society. Conservative societies are more accepting of people with unusual sexual orientation.\n\nIran is a Shiite Muslim country. Shiite Muslims are more accepting of transsexuals than Sunni Muslims.\n\nIran is a very religious country, but Iranian society is relatively accepting of transsexuals.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Iranian society is relatively accepting of transsexuals because it is a conservative society.\n\\item Iran is a Shiite Muslim country.

Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: I think there are two main reasons why depression is a side effect of prescription drugs:\n\nOne reason is that some prescription drugs are actually used to treat depression. These include antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and antianxiety medicines.\n\nSome people who take these drugs may develop side effects such as depression, anxiety, or mania.\n\nAnother reason is that many prescription drugs affect the brain and may cause depression. These include anti-inflammatory drugs, anticonvulsants,", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear? Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: Blue water is the result of light scattering in the water. Green water is the result of water absorbing light.  Lakes and rivers are blue because of their high mineral content.

The game Duck Hunt was a popular game using the NES zapper.  It was a game that was played in the early 1990s.  The NES zapper was used to shoot ducks.  In the game, you had a dog that would point out the ducks for you.  When you shot the ducks, the dog would then retrieve them for you.  It was a very popular game at the time.  The NES zapper worked by sending a", "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between 32 and 64bit computer systems, and why aren't there, say 128bit systems.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 32bit systems have a maximum of 4GB of RAM. 64bit systems have a maximum of 16GB of RAM. 128bit systems are not possible because there are not enough bits to represent RAM.", "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This works because Windows Task Manager is a separate process that runs in the background. When you press Ctrl+Alt+Del, Windows will switch to Task Manager, which allows you to view running processes.\n\nWhen you press Ctrl+Alt+Del, Windows will switch to Task Manager, which allows you to view running processes.\n\nIf a process is frozen, it won't be able to respond to requests. This means that it won't be able to respond to the request to end the process.\n\nIf you open Task Manager and then Ctrl+Alt+Del, Windows will switch back to", "\n\nHuman: How will new gun laws prevent mass shootings?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: New gun laws will prevent mass shootings by preventing the sale of guns to people who are likely to commit mass shootings. Many gun sales are conducted online. This will allow the government to track the buyer and prevent the sale if it is likely that the buyer will commit a mass shooting.", "\n\nHuman: Why do banks offer interest? What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Banks offer interest to attract depositors. If you are depositing money in a bank account, you would expect to be paid interest when you have the money deposited. \n\nBanks also need to pay interest to borrowers. For example, if you have a mortgage, the bank is lending you money to purchase your home. The bank expects to be paid back the money, plus interest. \n\nBanks also offer interest to borrowers, such as homeowners who are taking out a mortgage. In this case, the bank is lending you money to purchase your home. The", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Income inequality in the United States has been on the rise for the last half-century. The Gini coefficient, which is a common measure of income inequality, has steadily increased since the 1960s. In 2016, the Gini coefficient was 0.49, a significant increase from the 0.38 Gini coefficient in 1967. Despite the significant increase, the United States is not an extreme outlier compared to other countries. For example, the Gini coefficient in the United Kingdom was 0.40 in 2016 and in", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge? If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: I'm not sure exactly why those signs are on the freeway, but I do know that they're required by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to be placed on the freeway at a minimum of 500 feet before the overpass. \nI imagine it's so that truckers can slow down and prepare for the overpass, or if they're unable to stop, they can use the shoulder to avoid a collision with the overpass. \nI think those signs are a good idea because I've seen too many trucks", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly. I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: If you put a hand grenade in your mouth, the blast will kill you. The fireworks are a grenade. The guy put the shell on his head and it exploded.", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: It's not actually the trains themselves that get louder, it's that the air gets colder. Air is a gas, and as temperature drops, the molecules in the air get closer together. This is called \"density\", and denser air means that sound waves travel through it more easily.", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: A lot of people who have higher educations are either liberal or left-leaning, and there are a lot of reasons why this correlation exists.\n\nThe main reason for this is that higher education is generally associated with higher levels of income, which is one of the factors that determines a person's political ideology. The higher a person's income, the more likely they are to be liberal. Additionally, higher education is associated with higher social status, which also correlates with a person's political ideology. \n\nThere is also a historical reason for this correlation. The United States has histor", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: This is due to the fact that singing is a completely different way of using the voice. When we speak, we use a combination of vowels and consonants in a specific manner. Singing is a lot different, as it relies more on the use of the vowels, and not the consonants. In order to sing well, you need to learn how to use the vowels correctly. It also relies a lot on the diaphragm, which is the muscle that we use to breathe. So when we sing, we need to use the diaphragm to get", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The shape of clouds is maintained because of the pressure exerted on the cloud from the wind. When the wind is blowing in a certain direction, the cloud will be pushed in the same direction. When the wind stops blowing in the direction of the cloud, it will be left to float in the air.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is believed that larger animals have longer life spans than smaller animals because they are able to consume more food and obtain more energy. Additionally, larger animals are able to consume more food and obtain more energy to grow larger and live longer. For example, a fly will not be able to grow large enough to consume enough food to live longer than a whale. Larger animals are also able to grow into maturity more quickly which gives them a head start in life and helps them grow to longer lengths.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The name for your mom and dad is Mom and Dad because that's how you refer to them. These are common names that we use for our parents.\n\nIn some countries, people may refer to their parents by their first names. For example, in some Arabic countries, people refer to their parents by their first names.\n\nMom and Dad are also the names of two of the most popular American toys. Mom and Dad are a set of dolls that help children learn to play with dolls.\n\nAnother common name for mom and dad is Mom and", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are the digits that are significant to the result of a calculation. For example, if you were calculating the area of a triangle, it wouldn't be very significant if you wrote down 100 instead of 100.001. The number 100 is not precise enough, so you would write 100.001. This is known as rounding. In a calculation, you can round to a certain number of significant digits. So, you could round to the nearest 10, or the nearest 100, or whatever you want.", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Bile is stored in the gallbladder. After you eat a fatty meal, the gallbladder releases bile into the small intestine, which helps to break down the fats in the food you are eating. Without a gallbladder, bile will still be released into the small intestine, but it will not be stored. The liver is the main organ responsible for breaking down fats in your body. It is the first step in the process of digestion. The liver produces bile that helps break down fat. This bile is stored in the gallbl", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV is called the \"sweep\" and it is the sound of the electron beam hitting the phosphorescent screen as the TV switches on.  The noise when you turn it off is the TV itself \"shutting down\".\n\nThe sweep noise can be heard when watching a black and white TV, or when the TV is turned on and off.  It can also be heard when switching the channel.  The sweep noise is the same high pitched ringing sound that you can hear when listening to an AM radio station.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries run out of power due to the chemical reaction that takes place. The chemical reaction that takes place is called oxidation. The chemical reaction that takes place is the reduction of the electrons in the battery. The oxidation process takes place when the anode and the cathode are connected to each other. When the anode and cathode are connected, the electrons in the anode move to the cathode. When this happens, the electrons are now free to move. When the electrons are free to move, the electrons are now free to move. As the electrons move to the cathode,", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: I think it's because of the way our brains are wired. When kids spin in circles, they are stimulating their vestibular system which is a part of the inner ear that helps us keep our balance. Spinning in circles is a fun way to get the sensation of floating and it's also a great way to build up endurance. I'm sure kids spinning in circles also makes them feel a bit dizzy and disoriented, which is why they love it.", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted explanation for the origin of the universe. The theory states that the universe began with a massive explosion, a singularity, that expanded and cooled, forming hydrogen and helium. Stars and galaxies formed from the cloud of gas and dust and continued to form for billions of years. The Big Bang theory does not explain the origin of the singularity, but many scientists believe that the singularity was caused by the sudden creation of a new universe from a black hole in another universe, the so-called multiverse theory.\n\nThe Big Bang theory is supported by the", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: You count beats from the first beat of the bar. In a bar, there are typically two beats. So, you'd count the first beat, then the second beat, then the first beat again.\n\nHowever, in some cases, there may be more than two beats in a bar. For example, in Latin music, there are typically four beats in a bar. In these cases, you'd count the first beat, then the second beat, then the third beat, then the fourth beat, and then the first beat again.\n\nYou can count the beats in a bar by using", "\n\nHuman: The Jerry Springer Show\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The Jerry Springer Show is an American syndicated tabloid talk show hosted by Jerry Springer. The Jerry Springer Show features guests discussing their personal problems in the form of confessionals, with the intent of educating the guests about their issues, but usually resulting in fights between the guests. The show is often criticized for its controversial content, which some commentators have described as \"human train wrecks\", \"tabloid theater\", and \"trash TV\".", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: I think it is because when we were children, our parents and other adults would tell us not to be too close to animals that could harm us. This would cause us to have a fear of the animal when we were adults. When we see pictures of animals, we often find them cute because we are remembering the innocent version of the animal that our parents told us about. In a way, when we see the animal that has a cute or innocent face, we are seeing the face of a child that we once knew, and we are remembering the good times we had with that animal.", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a method of providing power and data over a single cable. This is done by taking advantage of the fact that Ethernet data is transmitted in packets. Each packet starts with an Ethernet header and each packet also contains some power. The power is not enough to run a device, but it is sufficient to start it up. When a device is powered on, it can request more power from the Ethernet cable.\n\nIn order to understand how this works, you need to understand a little about how Ethernet works. A full explanation of how Ether", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a very interesting question that I will attempt to answer to the best of my ability. The reason that we are able to see colours is that our eyes have cells that are sensitive to light, and each cell is sensitive to a different range of colours. This means that some cells are sensitive to blue light, some cells are sensitive to green light, and some cells are sensitive to red light. When all of these cells combine, the cells that are sensitive to red light are responsible for our seeing red, the cells that are sensitive to green light are responsible for our seeing green, and the cells that are sensitive to blue light are responsible", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a very broad question but the main reason 3rd world countries are underdeveloped is due to the corrupt governments and lack of infrastructure. Many countries are held back by their governments because it is difficult to govern a country with so many people, so many different cultures and so many different views. Infrastructure is also a major problem in 3rd world countries because it is so hard to build roads, bridges and other basic infrastructure. The lack of infrastructure is the main reason many 3rd world countries are underdeveloped. \n\nAnother reason is that many 3", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: The computers in government offices can be accessed through the internet for multiple reasons. One of the reasons is because government employees need to have access to all government data and the internet is the only way to do that.\n\nThe internet is a global network. It provides the opportunity to connect and access data from anywhere around the world. This is very useful in the government. Government employees need to be able to access data from anywhere in the world.\n\nThe internet is also very cheap to use. There is no need for expensive and redundant data center infrastructure in the government.\n\nAnother reason is that the internet", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cabbage releases water when you cut it because the cabbage is made of cells. When you cut the cells, it releases the water that is inside the cells.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time because our hands contain a lot of oils and when exposed to water, the oils in our hands go into solution and the water molecules go into solution.  This causes the hands to have a softer feel.  Additionally, the oils in our hands are protective and keep our skin from drying out.  When our hands are in water, the oils in our hands are removed and the oils cannot be replenished.  This is why our hands feel wrinkly and dry.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The Apollo equipment is too small and faint to see. The Apollo astronauts had to leave the equipment on the Moon because they didn't have the fuel to bring it back to Earth.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Drinking a liquid is dehydrating because the water content of your body is not replenished as you drink a liquid.  Drinking a liquid does not add water to your body, it just takes water out.  Drinking a liquid is a net loss of water because there is no net gain of water.  Your body is made up of 70% water and you are losing water every time you drink a liquid.  It's like pouring water out of a glass and not refilling it.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hispanic and Latino are not different. They are both ways of describing a person of Latino ancestry. Latino is a broader term that includes Spanish and Portuguese speaking people of Latin American descent. Hispanic is a term used by the US government to describe people of Spanish and Portuguese speaking ancestry regardless of their country of origin. Latino is the preferred term of Latino Americans.", "\n\nHuman: Why do different countries have different outlets?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The primary reason why different countries have different outlets is because each country is different and has different needs. This is a result of their political history and the way they view themselves. For example, in the US, there are 120 volts in the outlets, while in Europe, it's 220 volts. \n\nThis is a result of the way each country was founded and how they viewed themselves. For example, the US was founded by people that were escaping from the British Empire, which is why they wanted to be independent. This is why they didn't want to be connected", "\n\nHuman: How exactly does a terror organization claim responsibility for an attack?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A terror organization can claim responsibility for an attack in a variety of ways. A group can claim responsibility for an attack by posting a message on social media, by speaking directly to the press, or by posting a statement on their website. An organization can also claim responsibility by using a code word or phrase, or by claiming an attack was done as an act of revenge.", "\n\nHuman: The Monty Hall Paradox/Problem\n\nI was inspired by reading [this comment](_URL_0_) as well as the explanation given in the movie 21.\n\nThe basics of the problem, taken from the link above:\n\n >  the monty hall paradox, you are given a choice of three doors with a prize behind one, you pick door #3. door #2 is opened, there is nothing behind it. you are given the the choice to switch your choice from door #3 to door #1, doing so increases your chances of winning every single time.\n\nI know this has been posted before, but I can't for the life of me wrap my head around it. I will probably have to give up and just continue to disagree with the explanations, but I'm hoping someone might be able to help me understand.\n\n\nAssistant: Monty Hall's problem, also known as the Monty Hall paradox, is a probability problem in which a contestant is given a choice of three doors. Behind one of the doors is a prize, but the contestant does not know which door it is behind. The contestant is then asked to pick one door, and then the host, who knows which door the prize is behind, opens one of the other two doors, revealing it to be empty. If the contestant's choice was correct, they keep the prize, but if it was wrong, the contestant has the option of switching their", "\n\nHuman: when cannabis was still illegal in the US, how did high profile smokers e.g. Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogen etc. Not get charged for possesion?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogen and the likes of them are rich and famous. They can afford to be smuggled in and out of the country without getting noticed. This was a period when the US was a police state and everyone was under suspicion. The police have a tendency to overreact and they would have taken a hard stance on celebrities to make an example of them. They were also likely to have been paid off to look the other way.", "\n\nHuman: How can websites track you based on your monitor size?\n\nWhenever I try to use Tor in full screen, a message pops up that says, \"Maximizing tor Browser can allow websites to determine your monitor size, which can be used to track you. We recommend that you leave tor windows in their original default size.\"\n\nHow exactly does that work?\n\nAssistant: There are a few ways websites can track users based on their monitor size. Some websites use Javascript to check the width and height of the browser window. This allows the website to know the exact size of the browser window. This is also how Tor Browser can determine the size of the browser window.\n\nOther websites can use a combination of Javascript and HTML5 to detect the browser window size. This allows the website to determine if the user is using a mobile or desktop browser.\n\nAnother method of determining the size of the browser window is to check the user's IP address. Some websites can determine if the user is", "\n\nHuman: How bad is the U.S.'s education really?\n\nI can't seem to find any good sources on the notion that the U.S. sucks at education? Personally I'm interested in instead of full nation vs full nation how to subpopulations compare to each other? i.e. poor Americans vs poor Chinese, rich americans vs rich Chinese. Anyone familiar with this area?\n\nAssistant: The US is a developed country and its education is relatively better than most developing countries. For example, the U.S. is ranked 13th in the world in education and China is ranked 77th. However, the US has some shortcomings in education and it is not the best. In the past 20 years, the US has been lagging behind in education compared to many countries in Asia such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nThe U.S. education system has some problems, including a lack of diversity, large class size, teacher shortage and", "\n\nHuman: Why does it take two separate machines to wash and dry clothes? Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason it takes two machines is because the machines do different things. Dryers heat up the clothes in order to dry them. Washers wash the clothes by moving the clothes around and pumping water over them. You can't put a washer inside of a dryer because it's too hot, and you can't put a dryer inside of a washer because it's too wet. That's why we have separate machines that do different things.", "\n\nHuman: From crack to current, what is the story behind Toronto mayor Rob Ford?\n\nWhat has Toronto mayor Rob Ford been accused of doing? What has he admitted to? Are these things a reason to ask for his resignation? and finally, why hasn't he resigned? \n\nAssistant: Rob Ford has been accused of driving while impaired, driving with an open container of alcohol, and smoking crack cocaine. He has admitted to the first two of these allegations, but denies the third. Ford has been in office since 2010. He was elected on a \"tough on crime\" platform, and has since been a controversial mayor. He was the subject of a police investigation in 2013 into allegations of drug use, as well as allegations of theft and extortion. These investigations have been ongoing, and have not resulted in", "\n\nHuman: Why are South American GDPs so erratic?\n\nEspecially Brazil, Chile and Argentina's \n\nAssistant: There are many reasons for this. One reason is that these countries are heavily dependent on agriculture and commodity exports. This means that when world commodity prices go up, these countries benefit. However, when commodity prices go down, these countries suffer. Another reason is that these countries are also dependent on foreign investment. In recent years, we have seen a significant increase in foreign investment in these countries. However, this investment has also been volatile. In 2018, there was a sharp decline in foreign investment in these countries. This had a big impact on the economies", "\n\nHuman: Why can we feel hot/sweaty, but when you touch your skin (or someone else does) the skin feels cold?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When your skin is hot it is because your body is working hard to cool you off. The skin senses the heat and sweats to cool your body. This is called \"perspiration\". When your skin is sweaty it is cold because the skin is trying to cool you off. When your skin is cold it is because you are not sweating. Your body is trying to warm you up.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: People ask a question they already know the answer to in order to learn more. Asking a question allows you to learn more about a subject. For example, if someone asks you how to make a peanut butter sandwich, you can answer it and provide additional information about how to make it. If you do not answer the question, then you do not provide additional information.", "\n\nHuman: \"It's the amps which kill you not volts.\" But, wouldn't amps be always constant for given volt, as R=V/I. (Where R of human body is same)\n\n\n\nAssistant: For a given voltage, the amps will be dependent on the resistance. That means, the current is not constant. If you were to measure the current, you would find that it varies.\n\nIn terms of human body, the resistance varies in different parts of the body. For example, when you touch a live wire, your hand has the highest resistance. That means, the current flowing through your hand is the highest. If the voltage is the same, then the amps will be the highest.\n\nIf you do not know the resistance, then you will not be able to say the amps.", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't there psychotherapists who advertise themselves as working after 5pm?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are many reasons. In some cases, the therapist may have to travel to see the client. If a therapist has to travel after 5pm, then they may not be able to see the client because of the commute. The therapist may also not be able to work after 5pm because of personal reasons. For example, the therapist may have a child who needs to be taken care of. \n\nIn other cases, the therapist may choose not to work after 5pm. This may be because the therapist feels that they have done enough work and want", "\n\nHuman: What is fire??\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fire is a chemical reaction that releases heat, light, and other gases.

Examples of fuels include wood, coal, natural gas, oil, and many others.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The food we eat is processed by our digestive system. It is broken down into nutrients which are absorbed and used by our body. The digestive process takes a long time. Once the food is fully digested, the water is removed and the nutrients are absorbed into our body. If the digestive process is interrupted, the food will stay in the stomach and we will have to empty our stomach using the restroom. This is why we have to use the restroom after eating Chinese or Mexican food.", "\n\nHuman: How and why did Pokemon win the popularity contest against Digimon?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pokemon won the popularity contest because the anime was broadcast on Cartoon Network, which was a more widely available channel than the one that had Digimon. It also had a more mature plot than the one for Digimon, which appealed to an older audience.", "\n\nHuman: Why our stomach muscles tense when we cough?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Our stomach muscles tense when we cough because our stomach muscles tense when we cough.\n\nThe stomach muscles are connected to the diaphragm which is connected to the abdomen.
