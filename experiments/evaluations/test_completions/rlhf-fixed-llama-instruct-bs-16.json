I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I would say it depends on the cause. If the cause is muscle tightness then it will be muscle tightness. If the cause is a disc bulge then it will be a disc bulge. If the cause is a muscle strain then it will be a muscle strain. If the cause is a muscle spasm then it will be a muscle spasm. If the cause is a disc bulge with a muscle strain then it will be a muscle strain and a disc bulge. If the cause is a disc bulge with a muscle spasm then it will be", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: There are a few things that make one country's currency worth more than another.\n\nThe first is the size of the economy. A country with a larger economy will have more demand for currency, which means that the country's currency will be worth more.\n\nThe second thing is the amount of money that the country has. The more money that a country has, the more money there is in the economy, which means that the country's currency will be worth more.\n\nThe third thing is the interest rate. A country with a low interest rate will have more money in the economy, which means that the", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hippy generation was not in the same economic position as the 1950s and the 1960s.

And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: Sleep is a biological necessity, which means that we need to sleep, just as we need to eat and drink.\n\nSleep is a very important part of the body's daily functioning. A person may feel a lot better when they get a good night's sleep. Sleep helps the body to heal, rebuild, and restore itself.\n\nSleep also helps the body to regulate its normal functions. It helps to maintain a healthy metabolism, to repair tissue, to regulate the immune system, to maintain proper growth and development, and to release hormones", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'll give you a couple of examples of how computers improve over time.\n\n1. The first generation computers were based on vacuum tubes. The tubes are very large, and use a lot of power.\n\n2. The second generation computers were based on transistors. They are smaller and consume less power.\n\n3. The third generation computers were based on integrated circuits. These are smaller and consume even less power.\n\n4. The fourth generation computers are based on microprocessors. They are smaller and consume even less power.\n\n5.

All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: Well, I'm sure you're aware that it's important to chew your food well.  It's the first step of digestion.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: That is an interesting question. A normal IV solution contains water and salt, and the water is a big part of it.\n\nIn order to make a normal IV solution, you add a certain amount of salt to a certain amount of water. In order to make a solution with a certain concentration of salt, you add a certain amount of salt to a certain amount of water.\n\nIn a normal IV solution, the salt concentration is usually between 0.9% and 0.99%. A small amount of water is added to achieve this salt concentration.\n\nFor example, if you add 100", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: It's the fundamental limit to measuring momentum and position simultaneously. This is due to the fact that position and momentum are conjugate variables, meaning that measuring one of them will change the value of the other.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Well, let's start with the definition of the word \"hysteresis\".\n\nHysteresis is a phenomenon in which the current state of a system depends on its past state. This is because the system can only change if it has energy available to change, which comes from its past state.\n\nThe most common example of this is the way temperature changes in a system. As the temperature of a system changes, it takes a certain amount of energy to change the temperature. If the system starts at a high temperature, it will take less energy to change the temperature than if it starts at a low temperature", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

Rubbing your eyes may also result in infection of the eyes.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: A CPU is a very complicated piece of hardware. It is difficult to give a good explanation for a difference in price.\n\nI will try to explain the differences, but the actual reasons for the differences are complicated.\n\nThe CPUs are built with different manufacturing processes. These processes affect the cost and performance of the CPU.\n\nThe AMD 6-core CPU costs less because it is built with an older manufacturing process, which costs less to produce than the newer Intel manufacturing process. The AMD 8-core CPU costs more because it is built with a newer manufacturing process, which costs more", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The eyes are one of the most complex organs in the body. The eyes do not have any muscles that contract or relax, but rather they have a complex arrangement of blood vessels and nerves. This arrangement allows the eyes to move and change shape and also to sense light.\n\nThe eyelids are the two flaps of skin that cover the eyes. The upper eyelids cover the outer surface of the eyes, while the lower eyelids cover the inner surface of the eyes. The eyelids have a very important function in protecting the eyes from dirt, dust, and de", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: That's actually a really good question. The best answer we can give you is that this is an extremely rare scenario. It's extremely rare for people to be diagnosed with cancer and have no other symptoms until the end of their life. There are some exceptions, for example if someone has a rare type of cancer that doesn't have symptoms until very late in the disease, but that is not the case for the majority of cancers.\n\nIt is much more common for people to have symptoms of cancer. If you were to see a doctor because of those symptoms, they would run tests to determine", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not able to answer your question.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: There is evidence that excessive sugar intake can lead to weight gain, but this is not the only effect sugar has on the body. It also leads to increased blood glucose levels, which can lead to increased insulin resistance, and increased insulin levels. This can lead to increased inflammation, which can lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and even some types of cancer. In addition, excessive sugar intake can lead to increased oxidative stress, and a decrease in antioxidant defences.\n\nSugar is also associated with", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

We have now found a very interesting object in the outer Solar System called 2015 BP519. This object has a very weird orbit. It is moving very fast around the Sun and it is moving in the opposite direction to all of the other planets. So, it is not a planet. It is a comet. In fact, it is probably a comet that has been captured by the Sun and is now moving around the Sun in a highly-elliptical orbit.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because black widow females cannibalize their male mates, they have a higher likelihood of surviving to maturity and reproducing. A black widow female will eat her mate after mating and then produce eggs. These eggs will be raised by the female, and will then be eaten by the female. A female cannibalism is a common evolutionary strategy for black widow spiders, and it can help them survive when there is a scarcity of food.", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There is a very good reason why animals would want to eat fruits such as grapes, apples, pears, cherries, and plums. These fruits contain a lot of sugar, and this sugar makes up the majority of the energy source for most animals. Fruits such as lemons and limes, on the other hand, contain very little sugar. In fact, they contain more water than anything else, and animals have a hard time digesting and absorbing it. So, while animals would want to eat fruits like grapes, apples, pears, cherries, and pl", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: We don't release any information on our deals with our partners.\n\n<", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: Word is designed to be efficient.

My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: There are a number of reasons why a horse may be euthanized. Most of the time, this is for the welfare of the animal. A horse that is suffering from a terminal injury or disease may be in pain. If the owner cannot afford to pay for the treatments, it is often less expensive to euthanize the animal rather than pay for treatments that will not cure the animal. There are also times when a horse is old and suffering from a disease that will get worse. In these cases, it is usually better for the horse to be euthanized rather than live with pain.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The problem with the island is that the Turks and the Greeks have been fighting over it for centuries. They have been fighting over the island for so long that nobody cares about the island anymore. The island is not even worth the trouble to the United Nations.\n\nThe island is now owned by the European Union. The European Union has been trying to resolve the issue but the problem is that the Turks and the Greeks will never resolve the issue.", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: As a rule, human remains are very poorly preserved. Most of the remains we have are from the last few hundred years, when there was a huge push to find and preserve remains, and people started to understand the importance of preserving and recording these remains. But before that, it was not uncommon for a body to be left in the ground for decades, or even centuries, and not preserved at all. So most of the remains we have are from the last few hundred years.\n\nHowever, in the last few decades, we have started to find the remains of ancient humans from all over the world.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: A cable modem connects to the cable wire and converts the digital information into an analog signal which can be transmitted through the wire.  The maximum amount of data that can be sent through the wire is limited by the maximum amount of data that the cable modem can convert into an analog signal.  This limit is called the maximum bandwidth.  The maximum bandwidth is determined by the cable modem's data rate and the frequency of the analog signal.", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There were many ways.  The most common one was the loud, noisy noise of the town wake-up bell.

This time was called the \"hour of prayer\".  The hour of prayer was when the church bells were rung.  This was the time that the church bells were rung.  At this time, the town's people would rush to", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: In my opinion, a coin flip is a random event.  It is a coin that lands on its side, it is not a coin that lands on its side with a bias toward either heads or tails.  The coin flip is a random event, so the next flip is independent of the previous flips.\n\n\nTo explain this mathematically, we can use the following equation.  Let's say we flipped a coin 1000 times, and it landed heads 500 times.  In a single flip, the probability of heads is", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, the NES light gun was a piece of plastic that could be shaped into the form of a gun, and it had a barrel that could be pointed at a screen.

Mutations are bad for the animals, so the larger animals have a smaller chance of survival. However, larger animals have more cells and so have a greater chance of survival in a mutation-rich environment. In this case, it's not a matter of the size of the animal, but the size of the mutation.\n\nAnother factor is the", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: You could call them anything you want.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Well, your liver does store bile, and your gallbladder, the organ that stores it, is important for your digestion.

These receptors are specialized in detecting different wavelengths of light and sending these signals to the brain. There, the signals are decoded and we experience colours. The most important colour receptors are the three types of cones. These are the blue, green, and red cones. The retina also contains a fourth type of cone, the yellow cone. However, this receptor is not responsible for our colour vision. It is only responsible for detecting light wavelengths between the red", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's because they don't have enough money, the right technology, and the right resources.", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: A government computer may be connected to the internet for a variety of reasons.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them because the salt draws out the water from the plant cell. It is the same reason why we use salt to melt ice.\n\nIf you put a cut vegetable in a bowl, and cover it, it will release water because the water is still inside the plant cell. This is the same reason why we put plastic wrap over bowls of cut vegetables to prevent them from releasing water.\n\nA good example is ice. It is a crystalline solid. Salt is a crystalline solid. When you", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The skin on our hands is different than the skin on our face and other areas of our body. It is made of different types of cells that have different functions. Our hands are exposed to water and other harsh substances more than other areas of our body. This causes the skin to be more susceptible to damage. The damage can cause our skin to be wrinkly, dry, and lose its elasticity. The skin on our hands is also more sensitive to the effects of UV radiation from the sun. The combination of UV radiation and water can cause skin cancer. We can reduce the risk of damage and", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: They can see objects billions of light years away because they have light-collecting mirrors, and they can't see objects on the Moon because they have no light-collecting mirrors.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Dehydration occurs when you lose more fluid than you take in.

Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a great question, but there's a few reasons why we don't do that. The first is that clothes have different water requirements, and it's important to use different temperatures, and different ratios of water to fabric to get the best wash results. The second is that different fabrics have different drying requirements. We don't want to ruin a nice piece of silk by putting it in a dryer. Also, some fabrics are water-resistant, but others are not. So we need to use different techniques to get them dry. Finally, different fabrics", "\n\nHuman: From crack to current, what is the story behind Toronto mayor Rob Ford?\n\nWhat has Toronto mayor Rob Ford been accused of doing? What has he admitted to?
