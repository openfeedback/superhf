And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: The reason you sleep every day is because the earth's rotation around the sun causes the length of the day to vary over the course of a year. This rotation causes the earth to move from the light to the dark half of the sun's orbit, and back again. This is the reason the length of the day is longer than the length of the night, and vice versa. If the day were longer, then the length of the night would be longer than the length of the day, and so on.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time?

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: A sugar cube contains about 16 calories.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The answer to this question is that it is not possible to bring back Neanderthals.  The reason for this is that the Neanderthal genome was sequenced from a 38,000 year old bone.  This is an extremely old specimen, and the DNA from it is so degraded that it cannot be used to make a new Neanderthal.  The technology we have today is not advanced enough to revive such an old specimen.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender, or a transsexual that has not yet transitioned.", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I see, so you are trying to say that smoking marijuana makes you feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.?", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Well, there are many factors that come into play here.", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because shrimp are cold-blooded and red meat is warm-blooded.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: It's trying to do something, but it can't do it.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because they want to have fast food.", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: It is not clear what is meant by \u201cpolitics\u201d or \u201cmore polarized\u201d.", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods?

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver is the main organ in the body that breaks down fat, and it also stores bile, a liquid produced by the liver to help break down fats. The liver breaks down fats into fatty acids and glycerol, which are then transported to the small intestine. The pancreas also secretes enzymes that help break down fat. Bile is stored in the gallbladder until it is needed. Bile is released into the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) when fat enters the small intestine.

This is a result of the TV's electronic circuitry attempting to tune itself to the proper station. This noise is normally inaudible, but it can be made audible by placing a microphone near the speaker or by listening with earphones. This noise is caused by the capacitance of the high voltage power supply and the resistance of the tuning circuit.
