This is because the more precisely you measure the position of a particle, the less precisely you can measure its momentum, and vice versa. This is due to the fact that the act of measuring one value changes the other, and the more precisely you measure one value, the more imprecise your measurement of the other becomes.

Warm up pitches are not counted towards a pitcher's overall pitch count. This is because they are not considered to be part of an official pitch count.
