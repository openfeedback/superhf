That seems counter-intuitive, since it's the irrational numbers that are infinitely \"moving.\" Please help me understand.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Let's assume that the dart is some random number between 0 and 1. \n\n0 is the only number that is not on the number line, so let's assume that the dart lands there. \n\n1 is also the only number that is not on the number line, so let's assume that the dart lands there. \n\n2 is the only number that is not on the number line, so let's assume that the dart lands there. \n\n3 is the only number that is not on the number line, so let's assume that the d", "\n\nHuman: ELI5: how can babies in the womb spend weeks to months upside down without issue but any person outside of a womb would experience effects or even death in less than a few days?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is because the human body is designed to be in the upright position, and the body is constantly adjusting to the gravitational forces. If you turn your head upside down for a few seconds, you will feel dizzy. This is because the blood vessels in the brain are trying to adapt to the new gravitational forces. It is the same with babies in the womb, the only difference is that their bodies are constantly adjusting to the new gravitational forces, and they are in a fluid-filled space where the fluid can help them adapt. After birth, the baby\u2019s body will need", "\n\nHuman: How does electromagnetism occur?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Electromagnetism is the interaction between electric fields and magnetic fields that generates an electric field or a magnetic field.\n\nElectric fields are produced by stationary charges, such as electrons or protons.\n\nMagnetic fields are produced by moving charges, such as electrons or protons.\n\nElectromagnetic fields are generated by moving charges, such as electrons.\n\nElectromagnetic fields are produced by both stationary and moving charges.\n\nElectromagnetic fields are produced by stationary charges, such as electrons or protons.\n\nElectromagnetic fields are produced by both", "\n\nHuman: Bonuses. Newly appointed head of Xbox is Stephen Elop of Nokia. How did he get a 15 million euro bonus from Nokia when the company lost 15 billion under his control?\n\nAccording his wiki \" During the 3 years Elop was Nokia CEO, Nokia revenues fell 40%, Nokia profits fell 95%, Nokia market share collapsed in smartphones from 34% to 3.4%, Nokia's credit rating went from A to junk, Nokia's share price dropped 60% in value and Nokia's market capitalization lost 13 Billion dollars in value. The Financial Times calculated that Nokia shareholders ended up paying Elop a bonus of 1 million Euros for every 1.5 billion in market capital that Elop was able to destroy while Nokia CEO.\"\n\nI must have zero understanding of how bonuses are supposed to work. This guy is one example, but there are many others. \n\nAssistant: Bonuses are a way to motivate employees to perform better and help the company grow. The bonus plan for Mr. Elop was developed by a team of independent experts, and the bonus was based on the company's performance and his individual performance. The bonus was paid in Nokia shares, and the amount of shares were based on the value of the company when he was hired. If the company's value had grown, Mr. Elop's bonus would have grown. In addition, Mr. Elop was given an option to buy 1.25 million shares of the company at a price equal", "\n\nHuman: Does a charge of attempted murder include all of the crimes that go into the attempt?\n\nIf you say try to murder someone by kidnapping them, beating them up and then stabbing them several times, is the kidnapping and beating and stabbing included in the attempted murder charge or are all actions charged in addition to the attempted murder?\n\nHow does the law handle that?\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: What are the functional differences between a Cray super computer and my 2.7GHz i7 desktop?\n\nI know technology has advanced to a point where I can buy for $500 a device with more computing power than anything built in say, 1990.  What made computers like the Cray so large and expensive, and have the features that they were designed to provide been shrunk and mass-produced with our technological progression?\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the explanations y'all.\n\nAssistant: The Cray-1 was designed in the 1970s with the idea that a supercomputer should be built of a collection of smaller computers that could be connected together to perform a single large calculation.

In fact, it is impossible to replace the nutrients and benefits of milk with water. Milk is a source of 8 essential vitamins and minerals, including calcium, potassium, phosphorus, vitamin A and vitamin D. Milk also contains protein and fat. A glass of milk contains about 8 grams of protein, which is approximately 15% of the daily recommended amount. Milk is also a source of vit", "\n\nHuman: How come eggs harden when they are boiled while pasta softens?\n\nI searched this question first, and while I found one about eggs hardening, it did not explain the issue regarding pasta. As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: When eggs are boiled, they harden due to a chemical reaction, called coagulation. The proteins in the egg whites are denatured by heat, and the egg white coagulates into a solid white mass. When eggs are boiled, the proteins in the egg white denature, and coagulate into a solid white mass. The coagulation is caused by the heat. The proteins in the egg white are denatured and coagulate due to heat. The egg white coagulates because it loses the ability to form a soluble protein.\n\nThe prote", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar is not a question that can be answered by a human.

So where is it?\n\nAssistant: it's actually a very large swath of the Pacific Ocean, called the north pacific garbage patch, with an area of about 1.6 million square kilometers.  The patch is composed of plastic and other debris that has been collected from the ocean by the currents and winds in the area.  It was discovered in 1997 by Captain Charles Moore, who found a lot of plastic debris while sailing between Hawaii and California.  The plastic debris has been collected by the currents and winds and concentrated in a large area of the ocean", "\n\nHuman: How are kidney stones formed so rapidly in comparison to actual stones being created in nature?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: Kidney stones are made of crystals of calcium oxalate. In nature, these crystals are formed in a stepwise process over millions of years. However, in humans, they are formed in a rapid manner. When urine is supersaturated with calcium oxalate, the crystals start to form. As the crystals grow, they clump together and form a stone. When these crystals are formed, they start to stick to each other and the crystals grow. The crystals will keep growing until they form a stone. The crystals are not", "\n\nHuman: Do eyes get tired from moving constantly during REM sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: No. The eyes do not get tired from moving constantly during REM sleep.", "\n\nHuman: Why is eye contact so important?\n\nSerious question!\n\nAssistant: Eye contact is a sign of respect and interest.

The sixth amendment states that no person shall be compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself. This means that the government cannot force someone to make statements that could be used to convict them of a crime. However, a person may be compelled to testify as a witness in a criminal proceeding, but the government cannot force a person to testify against themselves.\n\nTo better understand why Benton Mackenzie could not talk about", "\n\nHuman: Why can't humans consciously control certain bodily responses and functions?\n\nFor example, (if I understand correctly) if pain is a warning that something is wrong, why can't we 'tell' our brain to stop sending those signals once we realize what it is?\n\nAssistant: Our brain is programmed to respond to various bodily signals. Once it has detected a problem, it automatically sends a signal to the spinal cord, which in turn activates the sympathetic nervous system. This is why our body reacts to the pain by sweating, shivering, and preparing for fight or flight. However, we do have some control over how our body reacts to pain. By using our mind to control our body, we can change the way the body reacts to pain. For example, when we are in pain, we can take a deep breath and breathe out slowly.", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps regulate the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine. It is synthesized in the skin by ultraviolet light. Vitamin D is a precursor to a group of steroid hormones called calcitriol, which are responsible for the regulation of calcium and phosphate concentrations in the blood. The synthesis of vitamin D in the skin is an endocrine response to exposure to sunlight. It is a non-enzymatic conversion of 7-deh", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: LEDs flicker when the video is shot with a shutter speed that is too low. In a video, the image is made up of multiple frames, and each frame needs to have a shutter speed to keep the image steady. The shutter speed is the amount of time that the shutter stays open to record the image. In general, the shutter speed should be faster than the frequency of the flicker.\n\nIf the shutter speed is too slow, the LED will flicker in the video because it is not possible to capture the image with a shutter speed that is too slow. If", "\n\nHuman: How does the box office work? For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: Box office is a business and is a way to calculate how much money is made from a movie. Some of the money goes to the distributor, some of the money goes to the theatre, some of the money goes to the production company and some of the money goes to the cast. It\u2019s a very complicated system and often the numbers are only available to the studios. I know that Interstellar cost $165 million to make and it grossed $173 million, but that does not take into account how much the movie actually made. The movie\u2019s budget is not necessarily how much it cost to", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: There are two kinds of cancer cells in livestock: malignant and benign. Malignant cells are cancerous and they can spread and grow into tumors. Benign cells are not cancerous and they do not spread. In the case of tumors, they can be either malignant or benign. The benign tumor is not harmful to the animal and can be removed. The malignant tumor is harmful to the animal and can spread to other parts of the body. When we consume malignant tumors, they can cause cancer in the human body.

When the receiver is placed near the secondary coil, it receives energy and begins to charge.", "\n\nHuman: What are sensitive teeth? My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth are the teeth that are more sensitive to hot and cold temperatures, air, and pressure. This could be a result of erosion of the tooth enamel. When enamel is worn away, it exposes the dentin (the inner layer of the tooth) and the nerves underneath. The nerves in the dentin can become more exposed when you eat or drink something hot or cold, or if you bite down hard on something.  If the nerves in the dentin are exposed, it can cause a tooth to be sensitive, and it can also", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: The hair follicle is a microscopic organ that is part of the skin.\n\nWhen we wash our hair, the water molecules open up the scales of the hair.\n\nThe oil from the scalp is also exposed to the air and water molecules,\nwhich causes the greasy feel.\n\nShampoo is a product that contains chemicals that can bind to the hair molecules and break them apart into smaller pieces.\n\nThese smaller pieces are easier to rinse away with water.\n\nThe water molecules again open up the scales of the hair,\nand the", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act is a law that was passed by the Indiana state legislature in 2015.

And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: Every day, we sleep for a set amount of time. This set amount of time is determined by the Earth's rotation. This means that if the Earth rotated more slowly or faster, we would have more or less time to sleep. \n\nWhen the Earth rotates faster, the length of a day increases. If the Earth's rotation were to increase by 1000 km/h, the length of a day would increase by almost 10 hours. Since we would need to sleep for the same amount of time, we would need to sleep 10 hours every day.\n\nIf the", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers get better over time because computers are made by people. The computers of today are made by the computers of yesterday. Just like how today\u2019s computers are made by today\u2019s computers, and so on, going back to the first computers, which were made by people. We don\u2019t have a general theory of why this is true, but we do know that it\u2019s true. The way that computers make computers better is by making them smaller and faster. The first computers were large and slow, but the size and speed of computers have decreased over time. Nowadays, computers are small and fast. The", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The calculator can show you 1*10^99 because 10^99 is a very large number, but it can not show you 10*10^99 because it is a very small number.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: Your farts are probably not the result of eating too fast, but rather from the way you chew. The way you chew is related to the way you swallow. If you are swallowing too fast, you will not chew thoroughly and will cause the food to go down the wrong way. If you do not chew the food properly, you will not be able to digest it properly. When you eat fast, you may not even chew the food, which will be difficult to digest.\n\nIf you eat too fast, you are likely to eat too much. Eating too much will", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: There are two factors that could cause this phenomenon:\n\n1. The medication is a liquid and it is being pushed into the mouth cavity through the tube of the IV. This could cause a taste sensation.\n\n2. The medication is a liquid and is being pushed into the mouth cavity through the tube of the IV.

This is controlled by the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. When the eye is tired, the muscles around the iris relax. This allows more light to enter the eye. To keep the eye from becoming over-sensitized, the eye blinks to remove excess light from the eye. When this happens, the eye becomes less sensitive to the light.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: 1. AMD and Intel are two of the largest and most well-known CPU manufacturers in the world. They have been going head to head with each other for decades, competing on both price and performance. The AMD and Intel CPUs are different in design, architecture, and core count. Intel has been using the same CPU design for decades, and has been using the same core count since around 2015. AMD has been constantly redesigning their CPUs to keep up with Intel. AMD uses a different design than Intel, and has been increasing the core count", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is because of the REM sleep, which is the deepest stage of sleep.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: The main reason sugar is bad for you is that it causes the body to release insulin, which leads to an increase in blood sugar and a subsequent increase in blood insulin levels.\n\nInsulin is a hormone made in the pancreas that helps the body use glucose for energy.\n\nInsulin allows the glucose to enter the cells, but if your body is constantly releasing insulin, the cells will eventually become resistant to insulin, which leads to a condition called insulin resistance.\n\nInsulin resistance", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Time is relative to the speed of light and the gravitational force at the location where you are. For instance, if you were to travel in a spaceship at the speed of light, you would age 4 years on earth because time on earth would have passed at a rate of 4 years. If you were to travel to a galaxy where the speed of light is 10 times faster, you would age 1 year on earth because it would have taken 10 times longer for earth to move 1 year than it would have taken for you to move 1 year. If you were to travel to a galax", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is a unit of length that is defined as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: It is possible to recreate a Neanderthal genome from the information we have, but it would be impossible to bring a Neanderthal back into existence.  We know that Neanderthals are extinct, and that the closest human relative alive today is the Denisovan.  We also know that humans and Neanderthals diverged from each other at least 700,000 years ago.  If we could bring a Neanderthal back to life, the closest thing we could create would be a hybrid between a Neanderthal and a Denisovan.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender person is someone who identifies with a gender different from the sex they were assigned at birth.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: While there is a lot of sociological research on transgender and transsexual issues, there is very little data on the history and the reasons behind the acceptance of transgender people in Iran.\n\nThere are no official figures on the transgender population in Iran, and there have been no systematic studies on the subject.

Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: Depression is a side effect of many prescription drugs because of the way that the drugs work in your body. The drugs that are most likely to cause depression are the ones that change how your brain cells communicate with each other. These drugs are called serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI).

Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many reasons why smaller animals live shorter lives and larger animals live longer. When an animal grows larger, it is able to live longer because it is able to adapt to different environments, such as hot and cold, better than small animals. When an animal grows smaller, it is able to live longer because it is able to adapt to the environment it lives in.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are used when you have a number that is not an exact value, but is close to an exact value. For example, if you have a number that is 3.579375, you could round this number to 3.58. This is because 3.58 is closer to 3.57 than 3.59.
