Let me first explain why sugar is bad for you.  When you eat sugar, your body has to use up a lot of energy to digest it, and then your body stores the sugar as fat.  This is why people who eat too much sugar get fat.

Water is a polar molecule, meaning it has a positive and a negative charge. This allows it to dissolve a variety of substances, including smelly things like urine and poop.

The human brain is the most complex organ in the human body, and it is the center of all of the body's functions. It is the control center for every activity that a human does, including thinking, feeling, moving, and living. It is made up of a central nervous system, which is the brain, and the spinal cord. It is located inside the skull, which is made up of the bones of the face and the cranium.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.  Bringing a Neanderthal back into existence would be extremely difficult and unlikely to be possible.  In fact, it would probably take thousands of years, even if it were possible.  In 1997, the Neanderthal genome was sequenced.  This meant that scientists could determine the exact order of the nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA) that make up the Neanderthal genome.  The Neanderthal genome is 99.4% identical to the human genome.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.\n\nIran is a predominantly Shia Muslim country. However, the Shia sect of Islam is not as conservative as the Sunni sect. In fact, the Shia sect is known for its acceptance of and respect for women. \n\nShia Islam is the largest branch of Islam in Iran, making up about 90% of the country's population, and 85% of the population of Iran are Persian.\n\nThis means that, in general, Iran is a very tolerant and open-minded country, and has a lot of", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: Thank you for asking this question. Depression is a common side effect of many prescription medicines, but it is not a side effect of all of them. It can happen because of the drug's action, the way it is used, or a combination of the two.\n\nFor example, some antidepressant medicines can cause a person to feel depressed. Antidepressant medicines are used to treat depression. They work by increasing the amount of a certain chemical in the brain, called serotonin. Serotonin is a chemical that affects mood.

What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are a way of expressing a number to a certain degree of precision. This precision is measured in terms of significant digits. For example, 53.27 would be expressed as 53.2700, and the precision would be 1 significant digit. 53.27001 would be 53.2701, and the precision would be 2 significant digits. 53.27001000 would be 53.27001001, and the precision would be 3 significant digits.", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this.

Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for using Ask a Biologist.\n\nYour question is about the function of the gallbladder and the bile that it stores.\n\nBile is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder.

Bile salts are chemicals that break down fats so that the body can absorb them into the bloodstream.

Rods are more sensitive to light and allow us to see in dim light, but they cannot distinguish colours. Cones, on the other hand, can distinguish colours, but they are not sensitive enough to allow us to see in dim light. Our eyes have three different types of cones, each of which is sensitive to a different colour: red, green, and blue. When light enters the eye, it hits the cones, which then send a signal to the brain.

Lets say you are given a choice of 3 doors.  One door has a prize behind it, but you don't know which door it is.  You are asked to pick a door, and if you choose the correct door, you win the prize.  The other 2 doors have nothing behind them.  You are then told that you can choose to switch your choice.

This message is to warn you that some websites can use your monitor size to track you. This is called \"browser fingerprinting\" and is a privacy risk.\n\nWhen you use Tor Browser, your browser sends a request to the Tor service. This request includes your computer's operating system and browser version, as well as the screen size and resolution.\n\nIf you use Tor in full screen, your browser sends a message to Tor to indicate that you are in full screen mode.
