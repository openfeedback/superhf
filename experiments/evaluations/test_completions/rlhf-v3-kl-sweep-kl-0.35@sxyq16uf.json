The NES Zapper uses an infrared signal which is not recognized by the new TVs.", "\n\nHuman: Why did purple became a 'dangerous' colour? (Like potraying poison)\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?", "\n\nHuman: In baseball, why does the pitcher's warm up pitches not contribute to his overall pitch count?\n\nI was watching the game last night and noticed that not only do they throw warm up pitches (pretty fast ones too) before the game but also between innings. It got me thinking.\n\nAssistant: Because the warm up pitches don't count towards the pitcher's overall pitch count, they are not included in the calculation of his pitches thrown total. This is because the purpose of the warm up pitches is to get the pitcher ready for the next pitch, not to count towards the total number of pitches thrown.", "\n\nHuman: what factors determine a car\u2019s fuel take being on the left or right side of the vehicle?\n\nWhat factors go into determining if the fuel tank goes on the left or right side of the vehicle?\n\nAssistant: The factors that determine the location of a car's fuel tank include the vehicle's design, size, weight, and the positioning of other components such as the engine and exhaust system. Additionally, local regulations and manufacturing considerations may also play a role.", "\n\nHuman: What is the reason for people having middle names?\n\nI have never called someone by their middle name. Even if a person didn\u2019t go by their first name, they went by a nickname or abbreviated version of their first name. \n\nIs it to distinguish people, especially as we now live in larger cities?\n\nLike there might be more than one Jose Ramirez in a city, but only one Jose Hector Ramirez? Or is there a cultural significance to them? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem very practical, in your day to day life.\n\nAssistant: The primary purpose of middle names is to differentiate one person from another with the same first name. In some cultures, middle names are seen as a way to honor a person\u2019s heritage or family history. They can also be used to distinguish between two people with the same first name, or to distinguish a person from a name that is otherwise too common.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but it could be that the palms of our hands are thicker and more resistant to irritants than other areas of the skin. Additionally, they are also less likely to come into contact with irritants since they are usually covered by clothing.", "\n\nHuman: How can human smugglers illegally ship migrants to a different country?

Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I can provide some basic information about hibernation. During hibernation, animals will enter a state of inactivity, usually in response to cold or food-less environments, in which their metabolism is slowed down and their body temperature is lowered. This can last for weeks or months at a time. When conditions are favorable, the animal will awaken and resume their normal activity. \n\nDuring hibernation, most animals will remain in the same position throughout the winter, although some species will move around slightly. This allows them to conserve energy and protect their body from predators. After", "\n\nHuman: Does Listening to An Audiobook Affect the Brain the Same Way Reading a Book Would?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Yes, listening to an audiobook can affect the brain in the same way reading a book would.

Why is that, and why do some need it and some others don't?\n\nAssistant: Burn-in is a process of breaking in or conditioning a component or product so that it performs to its optimal level. It's typically used for audio components, such as headphones, where the sound quality improves with use. This is due to the material of the headphones, which become more flexible and the sound is more balanced over time. It can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days depending on the headphones.", "\n\nHuman: What social factors caused Austin, a liberal hipster enclave, to develop in the middle of a highly conservative state?\n\nIt's something I've thought about fairly often lately. The idea of the 'blueberry in the tomato soup' is a bit hard to understand when you really get down to it. I love sociology and I've got some ideas of how this could have developed, but I'm still learning and I haven't managed to piece this one together on my own so far.\n\nAssistant: What kind of social factors do you think may have contributed to the development of Austin, a liberal hipster enclave, in the middle of a highly conservative state?", "\n\nHuman: In what ways can someone simulate \"zero gravity\" right here, on Earth?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Zero gravity can be simulated on Earth by using a device called a centrifuge.

I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: What do you think the implications of the US government defaulting on its debt could be?", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't casting agents celebrated at awards ceremonies like the Emmys and the Oscars?\n\nI think pretty much everyone on the planet agrees that whoever chose the actors for the *Harry Potter* movies did the absolute best job humanly possible. Likewise, *Game of Thrones* is a masterpiece of a television show in part because the actors so perfectly fit the roles they have been assigned to play.\n\nWhy aren't the people who make these decisions, which are so important to the success or failure of a movie or show, given major awards like the Emmys or the Oscars? I, for one, certainly think they deserve the recognition.\n\nAssistant: That is an interesting question. I think the main reason why casting directors are not celebrated as much as other people in the entertainment industry is that their work is often behind the scenes, and it is difficult to measure the success of a project in terms of their contribution. Casting directors usually work with directors and producers to select the best actors for a role, but the ultimate success of a project is determined by the performance of the entire cast and crew.", "\n\nHuman: How I'm productive at the library as opposed to being lazy and drowsy at home?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That depends on the type of work you're doing. Some types of work may require more focus and concentration, which may be difficult to achieve in a noisy, distracting environment like a library. However, there are many types of work that require less focus, like researching or writing, which can be done more efficiently in a library due to its quiet atmosphere.", "\n\nHuman: Why isn't the motion of the Earth used to produce energy?\n\nMoving turbines, and moving windmills are used as source of enery. Couldn't the Earth's motion (around the sun, and through the universe in general) be used as a source of energy too?\n\nAssistant: The Earth's motion can be used to produce energy, but it is not as efficient as other methods. For example, the kinetic energy of the Earth's rotation is around 0.045% of the total energy of the sun. The energy produced by the Earth's motion is not enough to be useful for us.", "\n\nHuman: why do houses appreciate in value\n\nWhy is that houses unlike other assets that we own go up in value? compared to let say a a car, over the years a house may go up in value if taken care but a car will go down in value even if it is well taken care of.\n\nAssistant: houses appreciate in value due to inflation, population growth, and scarcity.  Over time, the cost of materials and labor needed to build a house increases, resulting in a higher house price. In addition, as the population increases, there is more demand for housing, resulting in an increase in house prices. Lastly, due to land scarcity, the value of a house is determined by its location, which increases in value over time.", "\n\nHuman: What's the evolutionary advantage of laughing when being tickled?\n\nI'm hiding from a predator, a leafy thing brushes against me and I laugh revealing my location and I die. Not so useful. \n\nAssistant: There are a few theories about the evolutionary advantage of laughter. One is that it is a form of communication, showing pleasure or amusement. Another is that it is a way of releasing endorphins which can make people feel more connected to one another. It could also be a way of decreasing tension and releasing stress.", "\n\nHuman: What is electrical potencial. Is it an energy?

What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: Americans tend to view credit cards as a form of convenience and a way to build credit history. They also tend to view debt as a necessary part of life, and the potential rewards of taking on debt can outweigh the risks for certain purchases.", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between the oxidation process of aluminum and steel?\n\nThe oxidation process of aluminum is much less reactive than that of steel. Aluminum forms a thin, protective layer of aluminum oxide when exposed to air, whereas steel forms a much thicker layer of iron oxide (rust). Additionally, aluminum reacts with other substances such as acid and salt, while steel is more resistant to corrosion.", "\n\nHuman: Why is is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It is because the light causes the pupils to dilate, which increases the amount of mucus in the nasal passages, making it easier to sneeze.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is a memory, on an atomic level?\n\nIn order to retrieve a memory, the neurons have to access it somehow.

It is a way for them to signal hunger, discomfort, or even joy. It is also a way for them to strengthen their lungs and practice breathing.\n\nIf a baby doesn't cry soon after birth, it could be a sign of distress and may require further medical attention. It could also be a sign of an illness or infection.", "\n\nHuman: Is the US Police really becoming an arbitrary tool or is it just the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts?\n\nGerman student here.

This can cause a strain on the muscles and joints, leading to a feeling of soreness and fatigue. It can also cause stretching of the fascia, which is the connective tissue around the muscles, which can lead to pain.", "\n\nHuman: We eat food, drink water and breathe down our throats. Why do we gag when we put our finger in our throat?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We have no answer for this question.", "\n\nHuman: What is happening when our nipples get hard?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The nipples become hard when the body is under the stress of arousal or cold temperatures. The arousal response is caused by an increase in the level of certain hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen, which can make the nipples and areola more sensitive. The body also produces more blood flow to the area, which can make the nipples and areola hard and erect. Cold temperatures can also cause the nipples to become hard, as the body responds to the cold by producing more blood flow to keep the skin warm.", "\n\nHuman: Why haven't we been able to find out where Blue Whales mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they mate in deep ocean habitats which are hard to access and monitor. In addition, blue whales are highly social animals and they travel in groups which makes it difficult to find and track individual whales.", "\n\nHuman: What is the point of Kirchhoff's First Law?\n\nMy exam starts in 3 hours so this is late but what the hell.\n\nIf Kirchhoff's first law says the current going into a junction is equal to the current coming out of a junction isn't that basically saying that I=I?

Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: The rain appears to be stationary because the distance between the observer and the rain is too great for the rain droplets to appear to move. The human eye cannot detect the small amount of movement that would make the rain appear to be in motion.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: What was the most helpful answer to you?", "\n\nHuman: Why some animals have knees that bend forward and others thar bend backwards?\n\nWhat is the anatomical/mechanical advantage or disadvantage of having each? \n\nAssistant: The knee joint allows animals to move their legs in a much more powerful and efficient manner. It allows the knee to bend both up and down and also side to side. This allows animals to walk, run, jump and turn quickly. The knee joint also provides a degree of flexibility and stability that other joints in the leg lack. \n\nOn the other hand, having knees that bend backward allows animals to reach out and grasp objects with their legs. This is a great advantage when an animal needs to grasp something while still allowing it to move its legs freely. \n\nOverall,", "\n\nHuman: why I can buy brand new record players in stores, but not needles?\n\nAre there not enough companies manufacturing them?\n\nAssistant: It'", "\n\nHuman: Why airplanes only record audio during flights and not video? Wouldn\u2019t video be more valuable for the NTSB in case something bad happens?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a great question! The answer is that airplanes are designed to record audio for safety and security purposes. Video recording would require more storage space and consume more power, which would be a safety hazard.

How come you can't reseal?\n\nAssistant: When you break the seal by going to the bathroom, it signals to your body that it's time to release more urine, which causes you to go again sooner. Your body is unable to reseal the urinary tract, so the urine continues to flow until your body has rid itself of all the urine that was in the tract.", "\n\nHuman: Why so we have Fetishes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they provide us with an outlet for our sexual energy and allow us to express our desires in a safe and consensual way.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: How does a Skype call continue to function even when the program itself stops responding?", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The size of the opening in the lens, or aperture, determines how much light is let in and how much of the image is in focus.

I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: No, sound alone cannot change the temperature of a subject. However, sound waves can be used to increase the temperature of a subject by transferring energy to it, either through friction or conduction.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the ink is too thick and it's not absorbing into the paper.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we drool when we sleep?

Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: It's unclear why this is done, but it may be to help the website identify what part of the website the user is being redirected to. This is especially common with websites that use a lot of subdomains, such as forums and blogs, where the slash at the end of the URL can help differentiate between different sections. Additionally, it may be used to help the website track user activity and keep track of where users are being directed.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the US have to be close allies with Saudi Arabia?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I can't answer that question.", "\n\nHuman: How is Hacking possible.\n\nThis is a really hard concept for me so please bear with me.

For example, they can use malware to gain access to usernames and passwords, or they can use social engineering to gain trust from someone with access to the system and then use that access to gain further access. They can also use brute force attacks to try and guess passwords, or they can exploit software vulnerabilities to gain access to the system.", "\n\nHuman: why do things like metal and lava turn red when they are are hot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Why do things like metal and lava turn red when they are heated?", "\n\nHuman: why pillows, blankets, etc have those tags that are \"penalized by law\" if removed by anyone but the consumer\n\n\n\nAssistant: Why do pillows, blankets, etc have tags that are penalized by law if removed by anyone but the consumer?", "\n\nHuman: Why is there a statute of limitations?\n\nIt seems like it only really protects criminals (i.e. Bill Cosby), so why do we have it?\n\nAssistant: It's intended to prevent old cases from being brought up again and again in court, thus protecting both sides from the emotional and financial strain of a long legal process. It also encourages people to report crimes promptly and prevents evidence from being lost or forgotten over time.", "\n\nHuman: How do people accidentally die from auto-erotic asphyxiation?\n\nIf the human brain can survive for upwards of 3 minutes (no training) without oxygen, how do so many people accidentally kill themselves while asphyxiating themselves/having their partner asphyxiate them during sex/masturbation?
