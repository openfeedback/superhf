These packets are then sent from the destination computer to the next computer and so on until they reach the destination computer.  The packets are sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  When the packets reach the destination computer the information is translated into the information that you are looking at.

The first would be to find a way to get the Neanderthal DNA to express itself properly.  It would have to be put into a human cell.  There are several ways to do this, but it would be very difficult to get the two genomes to work together.\n\n2.
