This is because the pain signals are sent from the nervous system, which is controlled by the brain.\n\nPain is a complex process that involves many different types of nerve fibers, all of which have different functions. Some nerve fibers are responsible for sending pain signals to the brain, while others are responsible for the other functions of the body.\n\nThe pain signal is sent from the nerve fibers that sense the damage to the", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin. It is not made by the body and must be obtained from the diet or synthesized in the skin after exposure to sunlight. The main dietary sources of vitamin D are oily fish, eggs, and fortified foods. The main sources of vitamin D from the sun are ultraviolet B rays (UVB), which are not present in large quantities in the winter sun. A study in the journal BMJ Open found that exposure to sunlight is the most effective way to prevent vitamin D deficiency", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: LEDs flicker when there is a difference between the frequency of the alternating current (AC) powering them and the frequency of the LEDs' internal circuit. LEDs can be dimmed by changing their frequency, but not all LEDs can be dimmed, so the circuit has to adjust the brightness of the LEDs to keep the output the same.\n\nThis causes the LEDs to flicker. The flickering causes the video to be less smooth and more distracting.\n\nLEDs are made up of a large number of small LEDs. When a small number of LEDs", "\n\nHuman: How does the box office work? For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The box office is a revenue source of movie. It is calculated by multiplying the admission price by the number of people who see the movie in a given time period. The box office is typically reported in U.S. dollars.\n\nThe revenue generated from the box office is a major source of income for the production companies and the studios. The box office is the most important factor in determining the success or failure of a movie.\n\nBox office revenue is not always the primary factor in determining the profitability of a movie. A movie can be profitable without being successful at the box office", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: Cancer is the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in the body. Cancer cells are different from normal cells because they are unable to stop growing and dividing. Cancer can start in any part of the body and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer cells can form tumors and may metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body.\n\nCancer is caused by changes in the DNA of a cell. DNA is the genetic material in cells that makes up an organism\u2019s inherited traits.

The idea of charging a battery without wires is not new. The concept was originally proposed in 1891 by Nikola Tesla, who proposed a \"wireless transmitter\" that would send electricity through the air to receivers that would convert it to electricity. In the 1970s, MIT researchers developed a \"wireless battery charger\" that could charge a battery without wires. The technology was never commercially successful because the battery charging was slow", "\n\nHuman: What are sensitive teeth? My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth are caused by exposed tooth enamel, which is the outer layer of the tooth. The enamel is the hardest substance in the human body. Exposed enamel can be caused by:\n\n* Decay in the enamel\n* Cracked teeth\n* Grinding your teeth\n* Gum disease\n* Eating acidic foods\n* Exposure to cold or hot foods and drinks\n* Brushing your teeth too hard\n* Using the wrong toothpaste\n* Using a toothbrush that is too hard\n*", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: The greasy feel is caused by sebum, an oily substance produced by the sebaceous glands. These glands are located on the scalp and around the hair follicles. Sebum helps to lubricate and protect the skin and hair. The body produces more sebum when the skin is exposed to high temperatures or humidity, such as in the summer or after exercising. The body also produces more sebum when the skin is stressed, for example after emotional upset or illness. The body produces less sebum in winter, when the skin is colder.", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is a law that was passed by the United States Congress in 1993. It was signed into law by President Bill Clinton and it protects individuals from laws that substantially burden their religious beliefs. The law was passed because the United States Supreme Court had ruled that laws that burdened religious practices violated the First Amendment. In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled in Employment Division v. Smith that laws that burdened religious practices did not violate the First Amendment. The RFRA was passed", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry is a mathematical symmetry that relates bosons (particles with integer spin) and fermions (particles with half-integer spin). It states that every fermion has a corresponding boson, and vice versa. For example, the electron and the positron are the fermions that correspond to the photon. In physics, supersymmetry is a proposed extension of the standard model of particle physics. It is one of the most studied areas in theoretical physics.\n\nSupersymmetry is a symmetry of nature because it is a symmetry that is conserved.

How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: I am not sure what you mean by 'taste'. Medications and IV fluids are made from pure chemicals. These chemicals do not taste like anything.\n\nIf you are feeling a strange taste, you are most likely feeling the taste of the plastic tubing. The plastic is usually made of a chemical called PVC. PVC has a distinctive taste. The taste can be described as a bittersweet.\n\nThe taste of the plastic tubing may be the cause of the taste you are feeling.\n\nI have heard that the taste of the plastic tubing can be reduced", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that you cannot know both the momentum and position of a particle at the same time. If you know the momentum, you don't know the position, and if you know the position, you don't know the momentum. The uncertainty in one quantity is related to the other.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a phenomenon where the resistance of an object to a change in condition depends on the history of the object\u2019s condition.\n\nHysteresis is commonly seen when a material is heated and cooled. When the material is heated, the temperature increases. When the temperature is decreased, the material does not immediately return to its original state. Instead, it takes time for the temperature to return to the original temperature. The time it takes for the temperature to return to the original temperature is called the hysteresis time.\n\nHysteresis is the difference between the time", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".
