And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: Sleep is a necessity for all living creatures. Sleep is one of the most important things for us to survive. We sleep because it helps us to restore and repair our bodies, and also to maintain our mental health. It is important to get enough sleep each night because sleep is necessary for the human body to function properly. Sleep is also important for your physical and mental health. Sleep gives our bodies the chance to heal and rejuvenate. Our bodies repair and heal themselves while we are asleep. Sleep is also essential for learning. If you are sleep deprived, you may have", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers get better over time because we make new technologies that allow us to make computers more powerful. The IPhone X was impossible to make 3 years ago because it required new technologies that were not available at that time.", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Calculators cannot show 10*10^99 because it is an integer that is too large. 1*10^99 is a decimal number and can be shown on a calculator. 10*10^99 is an integer that is too large to be shown on a calculator.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: The amount of time you chew your food is related to the amount of nutrition you absorb. Chewing your food thoroughly allows you to extract the maximum nutrition from your food.\n\nThe longer you chew your food, the more nutrients you extract. Chewing your food thoroughly also helps break down the food into small pieces so that the body can digest it more easily. If you don't chew your food thoroughly, you're likely to have problems with bloating, gas, and indigestion.\n\nThe food you eat is not just the food you swallow. Your", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: The taste in your mouth is caused by the solution flowing past your taste buds. The taste is determined by the composition of the solution, and in this case, the taste is salty. The reason this happens is that the liquid is flowing by the tongue and the taste buds. The saline solution is 0.9% sodium chloride.\n\nThe reason that the solution tastes salty is because the sodium chloride is dissolved in the water, and the sodium and chloride ions separate from each other. This is called ionization. The sodium", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known. This limit is a result of the wave-particle duality of matter and energy.\n\nIn general, the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely the momentum is known, and vice versa.\n\nThe Heisenberg uncertainty principle is named after the physicist Werner Heisenberg, who discovered it in 1927.\n\nThe uncertainty principle is one of the most important and fundamental principles in modern physics.\n\nHe", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a phenomenon in which the response of a system to a stimulus depends not only on the current state of the system, but also on its history.\n\nHysteresis is a fundamental concept in many fields of science and engineering, and is particularly important in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. It is also a fundamental concept in economics, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and political science.\n\nThe term comes from the Greek word \u1f51\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, meaning \"to hold back,\" or \"to be behind", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: Europe is more liberal than America because Europe has a history of more liberal ideas, including democracy and the rule of law. It also has a long history of being a place where people can find refuge from political persecution.\n\nEuropeans have a history of being more willing to accept the idea of a multicultural society, and of treating immigrants as equals. This is in contrast to the U.S., where the idea of multiculturalism is a relatively new concept, and where it has been argued that America is a country built by immigrants, so it is not multicultural, and", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Rubbing your eyes when you're tired is a common behavior. This is a way to let your eyes \"rest\" and refocus. When you're tired, your eyes need a break from focusing on the same object for a long time. Rubbing your eyes helps relax the muscles around your eyes and helps your eyes refocus. This allows you to continue to focus on something else. Rubbing your eyes also helps the nerves in your eyes to refocus.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The AMD 8-core CPU is a rip-off. It's a rebranded AMD 6-core CPU, with 2 cores disabled.\n\nThe AMD 6-core CPU is a good choice, but it's a bit overpriced. The 6-core Intel CPU is a good choice, but it's very expensive.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Eyelid twitches are common and benign.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Water is a polar molecule, meaning that one side is positively charged and the other is negatively charged. When water is in a gas form, the molecules are moving around very quickly and do not have enough time to interact with each other. When water is in a liquid form, the molecules are moving slowly and are able to interact with each other. This interaction between molecules leads to stronger bonds, and this increases the molecules\u2019 attractiveness to other molecules. When molecules attract each other, they stick together, and this is what makes a liquid.\n\nWater is attracted to a", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The universe is a huge place and the speed of light is finite. The distance between stars in the galaxy is also huge and even though we can travel at speeds faster than the speed of light, it would still take years to reach the other side of the galaxy.\n\nIf you were to travel at the speed of light from earth to Alpha Centauri, which is the nearest star to us, it would take 4.2 years. However, if you were to travel from earth to the center of the Milky Way galaxy, which is 27,000 light years away, it", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter was defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum in 1/299792458 seconds.
