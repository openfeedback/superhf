I think that the answer is that people have a natural desire to differentiate between things that are \"actually\" milk, and things that are \"imitation\" milk.  This is the same reason that people who are vegetarians will sometimes refer to soy as \"vegetarian bacon\".  The idea is that if you think of something as a substitute for something else, then it's easy to accidentally eat it.  So, people who are lactose intolerant want to be able to avoid milk, but not accidentally drink something that's \"milk", "\n\nHuman: How come eggs harden when they are boiled while pasta softens?\n\nI searched this question first, and while I found one about eggs hardening, it did not explain the issue regarding pasta. As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: The explanation is that the pasta is boiled in water, which is made of H2O, a molecule with two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. In this case, the molecule is made of four atoms, and the atoms are attracted to each other, so they are more tightly held together.\n\nThis means that the bonds between the atoms are stronger, and so the water molecule is stronger. This means that it is more difficult to break it down.\n\nThe egg is made of a white, which is made of water, but there are two", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: The Watergate scandal and why it happened\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A novel of the Watergate scandal", "\n\nHuman: You don't sail, pilot, or drive a kayak, surely.
