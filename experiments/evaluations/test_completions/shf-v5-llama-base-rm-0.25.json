This limit is called the Shannon-Hartley Theorem.  The Shannon-Hartley Theorem states that the maximum data rate of a communication channel is limited by the bandwidth of the channel, the signal-to-noise ratio of the channel, and the channel capacity.  Bandwidth is the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted through the channel per unit time.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: I am not a biologist, but I do know that some scientists have made efforts to reconstruct Neanderthal DNA.  This was not done with a surrogate mother and viruses, however.  The scientists used ancient DNA to determine the genome of Neanderthals, then cloned the DNA using a technique called polymerase chain reaction.  The scientists then inserted the cloned DNA into human eggs and sperm.  This technique is not yet a viable way to create a Neanderthal, but it is a step in the right direction.

Telescopes have very large mirrors or lenses, and these collect light from distant objects, which are too faint to be seen by the unaided eye.  The light is then magnified, and the image is focused onto a light-sensitive detector, called a CCD (charge-coupled device).  This device converts the light into an electrical signal, which is then processed by a computer to form an image.
