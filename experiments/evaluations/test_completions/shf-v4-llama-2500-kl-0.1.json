According to the National Cancer Institute, cancer is a disease in which cells grow out of control. Normal body cells grow, divide, and die in an orderly fashion.  In cancer, this orderly process is disrupted, and cells divide uncontrollably and continue to grow, forming a mass of tissue called a tumor.\n\nCancer can be found in any part of the body.  The body is made up of many types of cells.  When cancer begins, it is in a single cell.

It is difficult to say exactly what time is. However, time can be defined as the measurement of change in the universe. Time is a measurement of change. This is why we use a clock or a stopwatch to measure time. We use a clock to measure how much time has passed since something started.\n\nTime is also a measurement of change in the universe.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.  It is a very good one!  Let us first discuss how we can tell the age of a human skeleton.  There are a variety of methods that archaeologists use to estimate the age of a human skeleton.  The most common methods are based on the size and shape of the skull and teeth.  When a skeleton is first found, it is examined by an archaeologist to determine how old it is.  After the age of the skeleton has been determined, the archaeologist will be able to determine what stage of life the individual was in", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.

The answer to your question is: Yes.  The amount of information that can be sent through a cable internet connection depends on the speed of the connection.  The speed of the connection is determined by the maximum amount of information that can be sent through the wire.  The speed of the connection is measured in megabits per second (Mbps).

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: A coin flip is a random event, so the probability of heads or tails is 50% (independence).", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Thank you for contacting the Tech Support Department.

The water droplets are so small that they are invisible to the human eye.  The air around them has a much greater density than the water droplets and air is less dense than water.  So, the water droplets are always suspended in the air.  As the wind blows, the water droplets move with the air.  The winds push the cloud along and the winds also push the cloud up.  The cloud is always moving with the air", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a common misconception. The short lifespan of smaller animals is a result of their size. Larger animals have more time to reproduce, meaning they have more opportunities to pass on their genes to the next generation. The lifespan of larger animals is actually longer than that of smaller animals.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Thank you for contacting Bing Customer Service.
