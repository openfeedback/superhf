What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Well, it is a simple matter of chemistry. When things are wet, they release more volatile compounds. Volatile compounds are the molecules that are most easily released from a substance. This makes them smell more strongly. This is why wet dogs smell so much worse than their dry counterparts.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

Men and women have roughly equal desire for sex (libido), but there is a difference in the way that desire manifests itself.  In men, the desire is more focused on the activity itself and less on the outcome.  In women, the desire is more focused on the outcome, and the activity itself is less important.

It helps your body and mind recharge.  When you're asleep, your brain doesn't send signals to your body, so your body relaxes.  Your body temperature drops and your heart beats slower.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future?

It has been sequenced to the extent that scientists can now say that Neanderthals and humans share about 99.5% of their genes.

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: It is because the way you speak is different from the way you sing. When you speak, you are using your lips and tongue to form each syllable. This means that you can hear each syllable distinctly. When you sing, you are using your larynx, vocal chords and breath to produce sound. This means that you can hear many of the syllables blend together. So, when you listen to someone sing, you may hear a group of syllables blend together, but when you listen to someone speak, you can hear each syllable distinctly.\n\n\n\n\"\"", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Clouds are made up of tiny water droplets.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: My liver stores bile in the gallbladder. When the gallbladder contracts, bile is released into the small intestine. Bile helps digest fats by breaking them into small droplets that can be absorbed by the intestinal cells. Bile is also important for the absorption of vitamins A, D, E, and K.", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: I don't know.

As a result, water molecules are attracted to each other. When you put your hands into water, the water molecules are attracted to your hands and to each other. As a result, the water molecules get closer to each other and move more freely. This causes the water to flow around your hands, and the water molecules move around more freely than they do when they are on your skin. As a result, the water molecules are able to pass through the skin easier than they are", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The Apollo astronauts left a number of items on the Moon.
