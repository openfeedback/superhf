Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: That would be quite difficult.  You would have to start with a genetic map of the Neanderthal genome and have a complete understanding of the genetic differences between humans and Neanderthals.  Then you would have to develop a method of modifying human sperm or eggs so that the Neanderthal genes are expressed.  You would have to do this in a controlled manner.  Also, it would be difficult to get the Neanderthal genes to express in the right location in the human genome.

The TV rectifies the voltage, and then filters it to get a DC voltage that is used to power the electronics inside the TV. The power supply transformer puts out a large AC voltage. The high pitch ringing noise you hear is the transformer trying to convert the AC voltage to DC.
