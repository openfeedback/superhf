If they are capable of much better vision, why isn't eyesight always more enhanced?\n\nAssistant: The eyes are capable of seeing more clearly while on LSD because the drug dilates the pupils, allowing more light to enter the eye and increasing the user\u2019s visual acuity. However, when the user sobers up, the pupils return to their normal size, which reduces the user\u2019s ability to see clearly.

I understand that there's a frictional force, but is that it, the book mentions even in the case where the solid was completely smooth, non-porous, that the fluid would still have a velocity of zero. Fellow engineers, physicists or chemists, can ya help me out?\n\nAssistant: No, sorry, I can't help you.\n\nAnswer: The no-slip condition states that at the boundary between a solid and a fluid, the velocity of the fluid is equal to 0. This is due to the fact that when a fluid moves across a solid surface, the friction between the two causes a force to be exerted back on the fluid, which in turn causes the fluid to stop moving. This is known as the no-slip condition and it is a fundamental law of fluid dynamics.", "\n\nHuman: Why can't we just use MAC addreses instead of the IP addreses?\n\nAssistant: We can use MAC addresses, but IP addresses are more commonly used because they are more universal and easier to remember.\n\nHuman: What is a MAC address?\n\nAssistant: A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to network cards that are part of a local area network. It is used to identify and communicate with the network card.", "\n\nHuman: How can companies say a product contains more than the actual amount?\n\nI recently got a \"2TB\" HDD, but when I looked at the HDD from Windows and it said 1.8 TB\n\nAssistant: It's possible that the company rounded up the size of the product to the next higher number. This is common practice in the industry.", "\n\nHuman: What could go wrong to lead an electrical outlet to spew water?\n\nAssistant: Well, it could be due to a loose connection, an electrical issue, or even an issue with the water supply. It could also be caused by a faulty seal, or even a blockage preventing the water from draining properly. It could even be due to a problem with the electrical wiring. There are a lot of possible causes, so it's best to have a professional take a look.", "\n\nHuman: How did money become so powerful/worth so much?\n\nAssistant: Money has always been a powerful force in society, but its value has increased dramatically over time due to increased global trade and the growth of the economy. As economies have grown, the demand for money has grown and its value has increased. This has created a \u201cmarket\u201d for money, where those who have it can use it to buy goods and services. As a result, money has become a very powerful force in society.", "\n\nHuman: What happens to a person's debt when they are the last person of a family line and die?\n\nSo lets say you owe a huge amount of money and you die, and there is no one to pass on your legacy and both your parents and grandparents, etc. are dead, what happens to that debt?\n\nAssistant: What type of debt are we talking about?\n\nHuman: Credit card debt, student loans, mortgage, etc.\n\nAssistant: In most cases, the debt will be passed on to the debt collectors. Depending on the type of debt, the debt collectors may be able to collect from your estate, or they may be able to pursue your family members for payment. If there are no living relatives, the debt may be written off.", "\n\nHuman: Why in certain crimes can a teen be tried in court as an adult, versus other times where they arnt?\n\nAssistant: Because of the severity of the crime committed, the age of the accused, and the maturity of the accused. Generally speaking, if the crime is very serious, the accused will be tried as an adult. However, there are certain circumstances in which a judge may decide that a juvenile should be tried in juvenile court instead. Additionally, the age of the accused can also be a factor. Generally, if the accused is 16 or 17, they will be tried as an adult. But if they are younger than that, they may be tried in juvenile court depending on the", "\n\nHuman: Why don't college football offenses work in the NFL?\n\nWhat makes the innovation in college football offenses not translate to the NFL? And if NFL offenses are somehow superior, why are \"pro-style\" offenses not commonly used in college football? Why do NFL teams value a quarterback's ability to play \"under center\" more than from shotgun?\n\nAssistant:  Because the rules and regulations between college and the NFL are different, the offenses that work in college may not necessarily work in the NFL due to the increased physicality and speed of the players. Additionally, NFL teams value the ability to run the football more than the ability to pass, and college offenses often prioritize the pass over the run.\n\nFinally, the rules regarding formations and personnel groupings are different in the NFL, so college offenses may not be as effective when they are not able to use the same formations and personnel groupings. \n\nAnswered by:  Michael B", "\n\nHuman: Why do a lot of children say they hate the other sex?\n\nThey also say \"boys/girls are gross\"\n\nAssistant: Do they mean the other sex is disgusting or annoying?\n\nHuman: Disgusting.\n\nAssistant: What do you think causes this hatred?\n\nHuman: I think it's because of the way society treats them differently and how they are often excluded from activities and experiences. It can lead to feelings of being misunderstood and unvalued.", "\n\nHuman: Why does everyone hate the band \"Nickelback\"?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.\n\nHuman: Why do people dislike the band Nickelback so much?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure. I haven't heard of the band before.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we find some smell to be nice whereas some we cannot stand?\n\nI was wondering if we could reprogram our brains so that we can start liking \"bad\" smells. \n\nAssistant: It is possible to reprogram our brains to start liking \"bad\" smells, but it is not easy and would require a lot of effort and dedication.  It is more likely that you can find ways to reduce the intensity of the smells you dislike, by using air filters or other methods.  You can also try to associate the smells with something positive, like a good memory.  Ultimately, however, the ability to enjoy unpleasant smells is a matter of personal preference.", "\n\nHuman: The Balkans/Balkinization\n\nthanks.\n\nAssistant: What else do you need?\n\nHuman: Can you provide me with the latest news on the situation in the Balkans?\n\nAssistant: Sure.

I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\". I have been to Boston before and didn't see wrong policepower. Therefore I'm asking myself where these videos are coming from and if they are true. This is not meant to be a revolutionist-topic. I just want bare facts and impressions from wiser people.\n\nExamples: _URL_1_\n(Homeless guy killed)\n\n_URL_0_\n(Guy killed after he tried to prevent wife and daughter from fighting)\n\n... countless others...\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question. The US police is not becoming an arbitrary tool. It is more likely the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts and creates a wrong image of the US police.\n\nAnswer: The US police is not becoming an arbitrary tool. It is more likely the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts and creates a wrong image of the US police.", "\n\nHuman: Why do some dogs recognise people on screens whilst others don't?\n\nI've seen dogs recognise their owners on Skype video/Facetime etc. However my dog recognises my voice but can't \"see\" me on screen. He ends up looking for me around the computer and acting confused. Why is it some dogs can see people on a screen whilst others can't?\n\nAssistant: What kind of dog do you have?\n\nHuman: I have a Labrador Retriever.", "\n\nHuman: How does a deadly cancer like melanoma actually kill you?\n\nWhat's going on in your body that actually causes your death? Why are some tumors benign and others malignant? What about a tumor makes it malignant?\n\nAssistant: When a tumor becomes malignant, it means that it has the ability to spread to other parts of the body. The tumor cells have the ability to divide and spread to other organs, which can lead to organ failure. Malignant tumors also have the ability to inhibit the normal functioning of the organs they are affecting, which can also lead to death. Additionally, malignant tumors can cause an increase in the number of blood vessels that supply the tumor, which can result in a build-up of pressure and damage to surrounding tissues. This can also lead to death.", "\n\nHuman: How does the body know when to stop growing?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What does the body do when it senses danger?\n\nHuman: The body responds to danger by releasing hormones and neurotransmitters that prepare the body for fight or flight. This can involve increasing heart rate and breathing rate, releasing adrenaline, and more.", "\n\nHuman: Why does water turn most coloured shirts darker, when water itself is clear?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you please explain it a bit more?\n\nHuman: When you pour water on a coloured shirt, the colour of the shirt darkens because the water is absorbing the colour of the shirt.", "\n\nHuman: How did foods like onions and cranberries get to be considered food, when they must have been so difficult to eat when discovered?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They were likely discovered at some point by someone who decided to try them, and found that they were edible. Over time, the knowledge of their edibility was shared with others, and they became incorporated into various cuisines.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: It is likely that the greasy feel to your hair is due to the build-up of sebum, an oily substance produced by the skin and scalp. Shampoo helps to remove the sebum and other impurities, leaving the hair feeling clean and fresh. Additionally, shampoo can also help to restore the moisture balance of the hair and scalp, which can help to reduce the greasy feeling.", "\n\nHuman: why so many sites force you to have a long, strong password with special characters, and then allow anyone who knows 2 or 3 things about you to reset your password?\n\nI'm talking about security questions. ELI5?\n\nAssistant: Well, security questions are used as a way to verify your identity when you reset your password. The idea is that only you should know the answers to the security questions, so if someone else knows the answers, it's likely that they have access to your account.\n\nHuman: That makes sense. But it's still a bit concerning that a malicious person could get access to my account just by knowing a few things about me.\n\nAssistant: Yes, it is a concern. That's why it's important to choose security questions that only you would know the answer to. It's also", "\n\nHuman: Why Russia is supporting the Assad regime?\n\nObviously they are allies yes. But Russia knows that no one else is really ok with this, and now they're (openly) sending weapons and such. Why do they continue to back Assad, knowing it will only anger the international community?\n\nAssistant: They view the Assad regime as a strategic ally in the region and a bulwark against the spread of Islamic extremism. They also view the conflict as an internal matter, and they do not want to see a power vacuum in Syria. They also want to maintain their influence in the region, and they see the Assad regime as a check against American and Western influence.", "\n\nHuman: Why is the limit for individual contributions to campaigns $2700 but Super PACs don't have a limit?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a great question! The limit for individual contributions to campaigns is set by federal law, which states that individuals can contribute a maximum of $2700 per election. Super PACs are independent political action committees that can raise unlimited funds from corporations, unions, and individuals, and can spend unlimited amounts of money to support or oppose candidates.", "\n\nHuman: Is there any reason for me to vote in national elections?\n\nI'm sorry if this sounds stupid as I'm not very educated in the matter, but from what I've read, your vote means virtually nothing because of the electoral college. So what is actually the point of voting at all? And for that matter, can I actually make a difference in smaller elections by voting?\n\nAssistant: Well, voting in national elections is important because it is the only way to have your voice heard on a larger scale. Your individual vote may not be decisive, but collectively, it can make a difference. For example, in the 2016 US presidential election, the difference between the winner and the runner-up was only 77,000 votes in 3 states. So every vote counts!\n\nHuman: Wow, that's amazing. I didn't know that. Thank you for the info!", "\n\nHuman: How did the US go from a budget surplus under Clinton to a massive deficit now?\n\nI understand that the tech-bubble burst, but what were the other factors/when did they occur?\n\nAssistant: Well, the US had a budget surplus under Clinton because the government was receiving more in tax revenue than it was spending. This was mainly due to the booming economy and increased taxes on the wealthy. But after the tech-bubble burst in 2001, the government began spending more than it was taking in, and the deficit began to grow. Other factors that contributed to the deficit include two wars, tax cuts, and an aging population which is requiring more government services.", "\n\nHuman: Cartesian Unit Vectors\n\nFor some reason I can't get my head around them. What significance do they have and how are they useful for applications such as those in Mechanics?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \"Cartesian Unit Vectors\"?\n\nAnswer: Cartesian unit vectors are vectors that have magnitude of 1 and are perpendicular to the coordinate axes. They are useful for representing vectors in two-dimensional space and for computing the dot product and cross product of two vectors. For example, in mechanics, they are used to represent forces and torques.", "\n\nHuman: Why/how can the Miami police boycott an Beyonce concert if/when it is part of their job?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: How do imports work?\n\nWhen you read that a country imports a certain product from another country, or that they can no longer import something, does that mean that the actual country can't or that people can't. Like in the US, Kinder Eggs are illegal, so that means stores can't order then right?\n\n\nAssistant: No, it means that individuals can't legally buy them. Stores can still order them if they want to, but it is against the law for individuals to purchase them.", "\n\nHuman: How does a sore throat actually defend against infections/colds etc?\n\nI'm extremely prone to sore throats and I fucking HATE them. They always start out either seemingly out of the blue or with some sort of dry/scratchiness and it will never go away, even if I drink a fuck ton of water when my throat is \"dry\".\n\nSo essentially to me, sore throats are fucking annoying and I don't quite understand why we get them if all they do is make a person NOT want to eat or drink, something I see as counter-productive when you're sick. So, how do sore throats actually help your body in any way?\n\nAssistant: They can help protect the throat from further damage by making it more difficult for bacteria or viruses to enter. The mucus produced by a sore throat can trap these organisms, preventing them from entering the body and causing an infection. They can also help reduce the inflammation and pain associated with a sore throat, making it easier to swallow and speak.\n\nHuman: That makes sense, but it still doesn't make sense to me why our bodies would produce something that just causes us pain and discomfort and makes it harder for us to eat and drink.", "\n\nHuman: Centrifugal vs. Centripetal forces\n\nHopefully with some very simple examples. \n\nAssistant: What are centrifugal and centripetal forces?\n\nHuman: Centrifugal forces are outward forces that act on an object when it is rotating, while centripetal forces are inward forces that act on an object when it is moving in a circular path. \n\nAssistant: What are some examples of each?\n\nHuman: Centrifugal forces can be experienced when you are in a fast-moving car. You feel a pull away from the center of the car, and this is due to the centrifugal force. On the other hand, centrip", "\n\nHuman: Why does the roof of my mouth and throat itch when I have an allergic reaction to something?\n\nUsually the first thing that tips me off that I am having a reaction to something (dust, cats, pollen) is the back of my throat itching. It sometimes spreads to behind my ears, for lack of a better explanation.\n\nWHY?\n\nAssistant: No specific answer, but the itchy feeling could be caused by the body's immune system reacting to a foreign substance. The itching could be a symptom of an allergic reaction.", "\n\nHuman: How do private prisons make a profit?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?\n\nHuman: How do private prisons make a profit?\n\n[removed]", "\n\nHuman: object oriented programming\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is Human: object oriented programming?\n\nExplanation: Human: object oriented programming is a programming paradigm which uses objects to model real world entities and their relationships. It is a type of procedural programming which uses objects to create reusable components and to represent data and the relationships between data elements. It is a popular programming paradigm which is used for developing desktop, web and mobile applications.", "\n\nHuman: How large can you build something before you have to start accounting for the tendency of said structure to collapse into itself on account of its own gravity?\n\nThis occurred to me when I learned about Dyson spheres, which are hypothetical structures an advanced civilization might build around a star to harness its energy. Surely something so massive would simply buckle under the pull of its own gravity and collapse into a sphere?\n\nAssistant: It depends on the size and density of the structure. If it is constructed out of relatively light materials and is relatively small, then it could potentially remain stable. The larger and denser the structure, the more likely it is to collapse.", "\n\nHuman: How is the Facebook Messenger app bubble able to float on top of other apps?\n\nIs it simply an override, or is it much more complicated?\n\nAssistant: The Facebook Messenger app uses a technique called \"overlays\". It is able to draw a transparent bubble on top of other apps and capture user input within it, even though the app is not in the foreground. This is accomplished through the use of a combination of touch events, gesture recognition, and machine learning.\n\nHuman: Wow! That's incredibly advanced.\n\nAssistant: It is indeed. But it is just one of the many powerful features of the iOS operating system.", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun worked by detecting infrared light that was emitted from the television. It would then use this light to track the movement of the user's aiming device, usually a wand or some other similar object. The gun would then translate this movement into the movements of the character on the screen.\n\nHuman: What is a light gun?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A light gun is a type of pointing device used to control a video game. It is typically a handheld gun-shaped device that emits infrared light which is detected by the game system in order", "\n\nHuman: What benefit there is to losing consciousness?\n\nWhen humans are hit hard in the head, they lose consciousness (boxers, football players, tradesmen, Homer Simpson etc. \n\nMy question is in two parts:\n\n(1) What makes the brain do this - is it the impact of the brain on the cranium? Is there some kind of tilt switch that says 'too much load, lights going out'? \n\n(2) What is the benefit / detriment to the brain ceasing to function at the cognitive level? I can only presume it's partly to make the body go totally limp to avoid damage...\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the purpose of a human's sleep? \n\nHuman: To allow the body and brain to rest and recover.\n\nAssistant: What are the benefits of sleep?\n\nHuman: Sleep helps to restore energy levels, improve mood, boosts the immune system, assists with memory and learning, helps to regulate hormones, and supports physical and mental health.", "\n\nHuman: why do i have to confirm the amount at the register now when i use a debit card at the store. too many steps and its bullshit\n\n\n\nAssistant: Why do you need to confirm the amount?\n\nHuman: i already entered the amount when i used the debit card at the store, why do i need to confirm it again?\n\nAssistant: To make sure it is correct and that you are authorizing the transaction.", "\n\nHuman: Why do your arms swing when you walk?\n\nI noticed it the other day when walking in a crowded place, everyone's arms swing by them whilst they walk. \n\nAssistant: The arms swing because of inertia. When a person is walking, the arms are moving in the opposite direction of the body, so they continue to move in the same direction until they are stopped by an external force. This is known as inertia.", "\n\nHuman: What is it that produces a sound when we rip paper? What are we hearing?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. Is it the sound of ripping paper that you're asking about?\n\nHuman: Yes. What is it that produces the sound? What is the source of the sound?\n\n\nAssistant: The sound of ripping paper is typically produced by the friction between the two surfaces as they move past each other. The source of the sound could be the paper, the surface it is resting on, or anything else that is providing the friction.", "\n\nHuman: why do giraffes have horns?\n\nI was just wondering...\nEdit: thanks for all the responses you guys even the bad ones :D And no I don't think that giraffes have ended their evolution process, your reading into it to much.\n\nAssistant: Giraffes have horns for defense against predators, and also for marking territory.\n\nHuman: Wow that's really interesting, I never knew that. Thanks for telling me that!", "\n\nHuman: In a democracy, Why doesn't people vote on the new laws and government issues?\n\nDemocracy explains itself as a system of government where sovereignty is in each citizen.\nThen how come we vote for politicians who \"represent\" us, rather than we actually vote for what we consider better for ourselves?\n\nAssistant: Because the process of making laws is complex and requires specialized knowledge. It's easier for politicians to make decisions on behalf of their constituents.\n\nHuman: But if we're sovereign, why do we still need politicians?\n\nDemocracy: Because politicians provide an important function in the democratic process - they act as a bridge between the citizens and the government. They are elected by the people, and thus are accountable to them. They also help to ensure that the interests of their constituents are represented in parliament and other government bodies.", "\n\nHuman: As an English person I don't quite understand how it's possible that Obama won the election yet the Republicans are the majority in the Senate... Please ELI5\n\n\n\nAssistant: The United States electoral system is based on the principle of majority rule, where the candidate who receives the most votes in the electoral college wins the presidential election. However, the Senate is composed of 100 members, with each state getting two senators regardless of population. This means that the Republicans currently have a majority in the Senate due to the fact that they won more electoral votes in the election, even though Obama won the popular vote.", "\n\nHuman: What gives a country\u2019s currency its value?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the maximum amount of money a country's currency can be exchanged for?\n\n[removed]", "\n\nHuman: What are the cognitive mechanism that drive us to consider suicide? Wouldn't the act of thinking about ending our existence be selected against or at the very least incredibly repressed?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: The cognitive mechanism that drive us to consider suicide is complex and not entirely understood. Many factors can contribute to someone considering suicide, including mental illness, depression, trauma, and life stressors. However, it is generally agreed that suicide is not a rational decision and is often a cry for help. People who are considering suicide may not recognize the implications of their actions or be able to think clearly, which is why it is important to talk to a mental health professional if you are feeling suicidal.", "\n\nHuman: Why do most software programs (web browsers, for example) display an error code that you have to look up instead of just telling you the error?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's so you can understand what the error means and how to fix it.", "\n\nHuman: How do storage devices become smaller and smaller?

Some wounds may also be too deep or too large to heal without leaving a scar, even with proper care.", "\n\nHuman: How do hurricane-strength isolated thunderstorms spontaneously appear on an almost daily basis where I live?\n\nExample: _URL_0_\n\nGet this almost daily in Virginia.\n\nAssistant: Do you have any other questions?\n\nHuman: No, that's all.", "\n\nHuman: How and why did Pokemon win the popularity contest against Digimon?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you think is the reason why Pokemon was more popular than Digimon?\n\nHuman: I think Pokemon was more popular than Digimon because it was released at the right time and in the right place. It was released at the peak of the Pokemon craze and it was very popular in the West, while Digimon was mainly popular in Japan. Additionally, the Pokemon games were more accessible and the concept was easier to understand for newcomers.", "\n\nHuman: Century beginnings\n\nI'm a little confused on the subject of centuries. How can the 20th century start in 1901?? Like isn't that the 19th century and in the 2000 it would be the 20th century?? So now we are in the 21st century but it's only 2017...... so....?? Can someone help me out please.\n\nAssistant: It is a bit confusing, but the 20th century began in 1901 because the year 1900 was not a leap year, so there was no year 1900. So 1901 was the first year of the 20th century.", "\n\nHuman: Spherical cow\n\nWhat is a spherical cow? I know that it is used somehow in metaphors but I don't understand what Wikipedia says.\n\nAssistant: What is a metaphor?\n\nHuman: A metaphor is a figure of speech that compares two things using the words \"like\" or \"as\". For example, \"Life is a roller coaster\".", "\n\nHuman: What is the \"singularity event\" that is referred to in Transhumanism. I keep reading about this event but nothing specific is ever stated.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The \"singularity event\" refers to the hypothetical moment in time when rapid advances in technology cause a dramatic change in human capabilities and the world around us. This could happen due to advances in artificial intelligence, robotics, genetics, nanotechnology, and other emerging technologies. It is often referred to as the \"technological singularity\" or \"the Singularity.\" The exact nature of this event is hard to predict but could result in rapid advances in technology, potentially changing the world as we know it.", "\n\nHuman: Why are semi-trailer trucks so deadly in crashes?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: What did the assistant say?\n\nHuman: The assistant said that semi-trailer trucks are particularly dangerous in crashes due to their size and weight. They can cause severe damage and injury when they are involved in a collision. The weight of the truck and its load can cause the truck to remain upright for a long time after a crash, increasing the chances of other vehicles being hit and injured. The large size of the truck also means that it can take up an entire lane of traffic, causing a traffic backup and creating a dangerous situation for other drivers.", "\n\nHuman: As a public figure, why can't Donald Trump's tax returns be released for him without his permission?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?\n\nHuman: Is it legal for Donald Trump's tax returns to be released without his permission?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but I'll do my best to answer. According to the Internal Revenue Service, a taxpayer has the right to access their own tax return information, but the law does not allow anyone else to access that information without the taxpayer's consent. However, there are some exceptions, such as if the Internal Revenue Service is", "\n\nHuman: r/fifthworldproblems\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the Fifth World Problem?\n\nUser: The Fifth World Problem is a term used to describe a phenomenon in computer programming where a program is written with the assumption that the underlying platform or environment is a certain way, but then later the platform changes and the program no longer works as expected.

Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but I think it may be the result of an imbalance in the body's chemistry caused by the medication. Some people may be more prone to depression than others, and the medication can tip the scales in that direction. It's also possible that the depression is a side effect of the illness the medicine is treating.", "\n\nHuman: what are laser beams  &  how are they different from light beams?\n\n\n\nAssistant: what is the difference between light and laser beams?\n\nHuman: Light beams are composed of many photons, while laser beams are composed of a single wavelength of light.

Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. This is because the act of measuring one value changes the other, and the more precisely you measure one, the less precisely you can measure the other. In other words, there is a limit to the accuracy of the measurements you can make.\n\nHope this helps!", "\n\nHuman: Why can a particle not reach absolute zero?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because particles can never reach a state of absolute zero, which is the point at which the particles have the lowest amount of energy and movement known to science. At absolute zero, particles have no movement and the lowest amount of energy possible. This is impossible to achieve in the real world, as the particles would require an infinite amount of time and energy to reach this state.", "\n\nHuman: What will happen to the price of gold if the US government defaults on its debt?\n\nI have a question: if the US government defaults, that will cause uncertainty in the market, and people move their money into safe options, like gold and US bonds, right?\n\nSo, if the US defaults on their debt, will that drive the price of gold up to ridiculously high levels, since the latter just defaulted?\n\nAnd, as a valuations student, do I need to find a new risk-free rate when valuating companies?\n\nOn a related note, what are some other safe options in uncertain times? I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: You may want to check out the US treasury bills for safety. They are low risk but still give a decent return. There are also corporate bonds, which tend to be lower risk than stocks, and CDs, which are similar to bonds but have a fixed maturity date. You could also invest in index funds, which are a diversified collection of different investments that tend to be less risky than individual stocks.\n\nHuman: Got it. Thanks for the help!", "\n\nHuman: Why dont electrons fall into the nucleus?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because electrons have a negative charge, they are repelled by the positively charged protons in the nucleus.

Got it. Thanks!", "\n\nHuman: Why correlation does not imply causation\n\n\n\nAssistant: Why correlation does not imply causation\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation does not imply causation because two events can be correlated without one causing the other. For example, two stocks may be correlated in that they both increase in value when the market is performing well, even though one stock may not be causing the other to increase in value. \n\nIn addition, correlation does not necessarily mean that one event will always happen before the other; two events can be correlated even if they occur at different times. For example, two people may both be born in the same year and the same month, but one may be", "\n\nHuman: if magnets lose their magnetic properties when heated, how is the earth's core magnetic?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is believed that the Earth's core is made up of a liquid iron-nickel alloy that is extremely hot and highly magnetized.

I thought most European countries had a better healthcare system than the US.\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's true, but the Red Cross has strict safety protocols to ensure the safety of their donors. There have been cases of communicable diseases like the Zika virus being spread through blood transfusions, so the Red Cross requires donors to have been to Europe less than 3 months prior to donating and to have proof of being tested for certain diseases.", "\n\nHuman: - How does the gas pump know when to stop pumping?\n\n\n\nAssistant: - It knows when the tank is full.", "\n\nHuman: CPU Hyper-threading and Threads\n\n[In this video](_URL_0_), the guy talks about how i7s aren't better than i5s just because of the hyper-threading, and he shows the performance benchmarks\n\nWhat really is Hyper-threading? Tried googling it and all I found was how Hyper-threading allows 2 threads to run on a single core, without explaining what threads are, and why running more is better\n\nEDIT: Thanks for answering guys!\n\nAdditional question: Is hyper-threading better or worse for gaming. [Is this statement true?](_URL_1_)\n\nAssistant: This statement is false. Hyper-threading can provide an advantage in certain applications, such as multi-threaded tasks, but can also cause a slight decrease in performance in certain single-threaded applications.\n\nAnswer: Hyper-threading is a technology that allows a single physical CPU core to act as two virtual cores. This allows the operating system to split up tasks into two threads, allowing for more tasks to be processed in parallel. This can result in improved performance in certain applications, such as multithreaded tasks, but can also lead to a decrease in performance in certain single-threaded applications.", "\n\nHuman: Why can't the government produce mass amounts of money and fix the debt that way?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because it would lead to inflation.

It got me thinking.\n\nAssistant: Well, the warm up pitches don't count towards the pitcher's overall pitch count because they are not part of the game. The same is true for between-inning warm up pitches. These are just practice throws that the pitcher is using to get loose and warm up his arm. They don't actually count towards his total pitch count.", "\n\nHuman: In Cars how exactly do companies like Overfinch and AMG operate? Can they just be called Customisation companies?

Don't make it so long or else I'll be trying to read this stuff for hours. \n\nAssistant: Well, it's likely that you have had a negative experience with pop music at some point in your life, and that experience has caused you to associate pop music with bad taste. On the other hand, you have likely had a positive experience with metal music, which has caused you to associate it with good taste. This is a form of cognitive bias known as the \"availability heuristic\", which states that our brains are more likely to take notice of and remember the information that is more easily accessible. In this case, you have had more experience with metal music and thus, it is more accessible to you,", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is a memory, on an atomic level?\n\nIn order to retrieve a memory, the neurons have to access it somehow.

I know bedhead contributes but I'd like to know other reasons.\n\nAssistant: Well, it's possible that our faces are puffy and swollen from sleeping, our eyes are heavy and puffy from lack of sleep, our skin is dull from dehydration, and our makeup isn't as fresh as it was when we went to bed.  Additionally, many people have reported feeling more self-conscious in the mornings due to lack of sleep and feeling more tired and sluggish.  All of these factors could contribute to the feeling that we look less than our best right after waking up.\n\nHuman: Yeah, that makes", "\n\nHuman: How do truth serums work?\n\nFound myself wondering this today.\n\nAssistant: They work by making people feel more comfortable and less defensive, which can lead them to reveal more information than they normally would. Truth serums can also reduce the resistance people have to answering questions and can cause them to answer questions more quickly.

Or is the discrepancy caused by the way a camera works differently from our eyes?\n\nOr is it some psychological thing, showing how subjectively we view our own faces versus the objective view the camera sees?\n\nAssistant: The phone \"selfie\" is taken from a different angle than the way a person normally looks in a mirror, and the distance from the subject also plays a role. Cameras also have a different field of view than human eyes, which can create distortion. Finally, the way a person views their own face is subjective, while the camera objectively records what it sees.", "\n\nHuman: How snorted substances affect the brain without properly being ingested or injected\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the correct way to pronounce 'snorted'?\n\nHuman: Snorted. \nAssistant: Do you mean 'snorted' as in 'snorted a line of cocaine'? \nHuman: Yes.", "\n\nHuman: Why is the marriageable age and age of consent set lower for girls than for boys in most of the world?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because of the historical and cultural norms that are still prevalent in many societies, girls are often seen as a family\u2019s economic burden and are married off younger than boys, who are seen as more capable of providing for their families.

Where does it go? I've read about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch but the in between steps boggle my mind.\n\nAssistant: The toilet and other large items you mentioned would likely be collected by a junk removal service. The toilet would be broken down and sent to a landfill or incinerator. The other items would likely be sorted, recycled, or repurposed as best as possible.

Why is that?  \n\nAssistant: - Fingernails are made of a protein called keratin, which is a hard, dead substance. As keratin is constantly being grown and broken down, the color of the nail changes as different pigments are deposited in the nail. This can happen due to natural aging, exposure to sunlight, and other factors. The color change can also be caused by a condition called keratinization, which is when the nails become thicker and more opaque due to the buildup of keratin. \n\nHuman: - What are the health benefits of drinking green tea", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting observation. It could be that the metabolic rate of smaller animals is higher relative to their body size, which means they expend more energy and use up their resources faster. This could contribute to a shorter lifespan. On the other hand, larger animals may have a slower metabolic rate, which allows them to conserve resources and live longer.", "\n\nHuman: How does the body shed non-external cells? (not on the skin, or in the digestive tract?)\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: The body sheds cells through a process called apoptosis. Apoptosis is a type of cell death that is programmed and regulated by the body. It is a normal and necessary part of the body's development and homeostasis. During apoptosis, the body breaks down and digests the cells, and the contents of the cells are recycled or excreted.", "\n\nHuman: Why HIV/AIDS is/was prevalent amongst gay men and in Africa\n\nI have always been curious about why HIV/AIDS was/is prevalent amongst gay men (or at least considered so by society). Also, why is there such a high concentration of infection in Africa? I understand the idea that poverty (in Africa) is a contributing factor, but then wouldn't HIV/AIDS be just as prevalent in other poverty-stricken countries? \n\nI appreciate any facts that you may know of concerning the illness as well!\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question. We do have some information on this topic that we can share with you.\n\nHIV/AIDS has been prevalent amongst gay men for a few reasons. The first reason is that gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are a vulnerable population when it comes to the spread of the virus. This is due to the fact that anal sex is a common practice within the gay community, and this increases the risk of transmission. Additionally, gay men are often in closed, intimate relationships which can facilitate the spread of the virus.\n\nThe second", "\n\nHuman: Why are Polo shirts and shirts with collars considered nice-looking (compared to a tee-shirt)\n\nWho decided that it looks nice?\n\nAssistant: Well, it's an opinion.

I think Overwatch is also Tuesdays.\n\nWhat is it about a Tuesday?\n\nAssistant: Well, it might have something to do with the fact that the weekend is the most popular time for players to take a break from the game, so resetting on a Tuesday gives players an extra day of downtime before the weekend. Additionally, resetting on a Tuesday allows developers to quickly test new content and balance the game before players have a chance to discover the full potential of the current content.", "\n\nHuman: My Econ teacher posed a question to us regarding Sunk Costs.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Can you explain what Sunk Costs are?\n\nHuman: Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered.

Other allergies generally do not have such a strong reaction.  The specific protein in nuts that causes the reaction is also found in other foods such as soy, eggs, and wheat, and people who are allergic to nuts may also be allergic to these other foods.  Additionally, the risk of cross-reactivity between nuts and other foods is higher than with other allergens.  Therefore, nut allergies can be particularly difficult to manage.

Additionally, they may have to use their right hand for certain procedures, such as filling out paperwork.", "\n\nHuman: Internet speeds e.g mbit/kbps\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the speed of the internet connection?\n\nHuman: I don't know.\n\nAssistant: What is the speed of your internet connection in kilobits per second?\n\nHuman: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: Is it possible to put out a fire by lowering the temperature alone?\n\nWe learned that a fire needs three things, fuel, oxygen, and heat. Remove one of the three and the \"triangle\" collapses and the fire goes out. Most conventional methods of putting out a fire involves smothering it, thereby removing the fuel and/or oxygen. But is it possible to kill a fire by just lowering the temperature? As in put it in a freezer and just get it cold? And if so how low does the temperature need to be?\n\nAssistant: Well, it's possible to put out a fire by lowering the temperature. The lowest temperature at which a fire can be extinguished is around -20\u00b0 Celsius, but it's generally recommended to keep the temperature around -40\u00b0 Celsius for extended periods of time.", "\n\nHuman: After the Big Bang, how did the Universe form multiple galaxies and establish order from disorder?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What other questions do you have?\n\nHuman: What is the composition of the Universe?\n\nAssistant: The composition of the Universe is mainly composed of dark matter and dark energy, with about 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% neutral atoms, and 68.3% dark matter.", "\n\nHuman: why most multinational companies don't pay the same salary in all countries for the same roles/responsibilities? For example a software developer that works for google in a makes much more money in US than in other countries.

Additionally, some public Wi-Fi networks require a login with an email address or other form of authentication, which can help identify users.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids perceive vegetables to be less appetizing than other foods (ie meats, starches, etc)?\n\nAnd even adults I suppose.\n\nWhat is there about vegetables (and even fruits) that are less appealing to some (perhaps even most) people than other foods?  Why do parents have to persuade their children to eat their fruits and vegetables?\n\nAssistant: Are there any psychological or sociological theories about why this is the case?\n\nAnswer: Yes, there are several psychological and sociological theories that attempt to explain why some people find vegetables less appealing than other foods.  One theory is that vegetables are often seen as a \u201chealthy\u201d or \u201cdiet\u201d food, which can make them seem less desirable compared to other foods that are higher in calories and fat.  Additionally, vegetables often have a strong flavor, which can be an acquired taste for some people.  Another potential factor is that some vegetables are viewed", "\n\nHuman: What are those white tabs on football helmets that players pull outwards whenever they're done with a drive?\n\nThey're just two white tabs on the sides of the football helmet that the players pull to release them.

Comedy and musicals are typically both genres of films, so it makes sense that they would be grouped together. However, it might be helpful to look at the categories for each type of movie to understand why they are separated into their own categories. For TV comedies, the category is generally for programs that are designed to make an audience laugh. Musicals, on the other hand, typically have songs and dance as a major part of the story and plot line.", "\n\nHuman: Why do I need to urinate more when concentrating?\n\nWhen I'm concentrating really hard (e.g. programming or playing an fps game), I need to urinate 100x more frequently than usual.. why is this, do I output brain-fuel?\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. It is not clear why this happens. One possible explanation is that when you concentrate hard, your body is working harder and therefore needs more fluid. Another possibility is that when you are concentrating hard, your body is using up more energy and therefore needs more fluid to process. The third possibility is that when you are concentrating hard, your bladder may be empty less often and therefore you need to urinate more often. There may be other explanations as well.", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the music industry implement a Steam-like pricing system?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Why don't they?\n\nHuman: Because they want to maximize their profits by charging whatever the market will bear.", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens if you ignore medical bills? [USA]\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What happens if you don't pay medical bills?\n\nHuman: Generally, medical providers will send the bills to a collection agency and report the outstanding balance to the credit bureaus.

In some cases, the medical provider may take legal action to collect the debt.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it so easy to remember a tune from a song but it's difficult to remember something such as directions how to get somewhere, someone's name or phone number, etc.?\n\nI can literally remember every note in a 3 minute guitar solo and can't remember someone's name 5 seconds after they tell me. Even when I'm paying attention to someone giving me directions, I'll forget them 1 minute later. Or something as simple as a 10 digit phone number is useless even trying to remember...\n\nWhat made me think about this was I watched a youtube video of a guitar solo that I originally watched maybe 5 years ago and I could still hum along with it perfectly. I can't even remember some peoples names from high school even though I heard them regularly over many years in school together\n\nAssistant: What kind of music do you typically listen to?\n\nHuman: I mostly listen to rock and metal, but I also enjoy jazz, blues, and classical music.

I am pretty sure it is based off of a division of months. This makes Q1 Jan-Mar etc. once I get to that point, I have a hard time understanding the week counts. Specifically the first and last weeks in the quarter. Is the first week of January part of Q1 or was that Q4, and similarly the last week of the quarter. \n\nMy profit sharing is calculated quarterly. In most cases it is based off of a 12 week payout. \n\nAssistant: What do you mean by 'most cases'?\n\nHuman: Generally speaking, if a quarter is 12 weeks, 13 weeks is the exception, not the rule. \n\nAnswer: 13 weeks is the exception. \n\nComment: This should be an answer, not a comment.\n\nAnswer: The first and last weeks of the quarter are not part of the quarter itself.  So the first week of January is not part of Q1, it's part of Q4. Similarly, the last week of the quarter is not part of the quarter, it's", "\n\nHuman: Why is eggnog only served around christmas?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.

This means that each individual dollar is worth less, since there are more of them.\n\nHuman: ok, so how does the government create more money?\n\nAssistant: The government can create more money through printing money, borrowing money, or creating digital currency.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: It's a phenomenon that occurs when a system's response to an input is not only dependent on the current state of the system, but also on its history. It's a way of describing how an object's past influences its future behavior. It's a bit like how a room temperature might be affected by how cold it was yesterday - the more it was cooled down, the more it will take to warm up again.\n\nHuman: That makes sense.

For instance the Grey Wolf (closest living relative to the domesticated dog). Are there innate things that humans do now because of what our ancestors did in the past?\n\nReason I ask is because I am visiting my in-laws currently and they have 2 German Shepherds. I went out to smoke and brought the dogs with so they can potty. Instead of pottying the dogs ran to me with rubber Frisbees. One thing led to another and I ended up play fetch for nearly an hour with them. I was damn near amazed that they just kept coming for more.\n\nI'm 24 years old and due to my severe allergies growing up I never had the pleasure of owning a dog. So this is all new to me. :)\n\nAssistant: What does this have to do with evolution?\n\nHuman: Well, I was wondering if there are any evolutionary benefits to playing fetch with dogs. Or is it just a behavior that has been passed down through generations?\n\nAssistant: It is likely a behavior that has been passed down through generations. Dogs are highly social creatures and playing fetch is a great way for them to bond with their owners and exercise their minds and bodies. It also helps them stay in shape and can help reduce stress levels. \n\nHuman: Interesting. So is there any evidence that playing fetch with dogs", "\n\nHuman: If atoms are so small, why is splitting one so powerful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because atoms are the building blocks of all matter, when you split one atom, you can create a chain reaction that results in the splitting of many more atoms.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window.

I know it doesn't consist of stereotypical \"man haters\", but I see a lot of very well learned women involved in \"feminist theory\" and things like that. I realize that the playing field isn't quite equal currently, but it's a far cry from the days of women campaigning for the right to vote. What does a self-described feminist do in modern times, exactly?\n\nAssistant: What is it that you're struggling with? Is it the concept of feminism or the practical application?\n\nHuman: Well, I guess both. I'm not sure what feminism is supposed to look like in practice. I'm aware of some of the historical achievements of the feminist movement, such as equal pay and the right to vote, but I'm not sure what the modern goals are.\n\nAssistant: Well, feminism today is focused on achieving true equality between the sexes.

I havent seemed to find any.)\n\nAssistant:  Why wasn't the government more involved in protecting strikers?\n\nI understand that the government at the time wasnt always sympathetic to labor unions and strikes, but it still seemed strange that they werent at least more involved in keeping strikers safe.\n\nAnswer:  Strikebreakers rarely faced criminal charges for their actions because the law generally supported their right to cross picket lines and take strikers' jobs. Additionally, many state and local governments were sympathetic to business owners and did not intervene to protect strikers. In some cases, police were even used to break strik", "\n\nHuman: why are cats always slapping stuff\n\n\n\nAssistant: They like to explore their environment and sometimes they can get a bit playful.", "\n\nHuman: How are vendors outside of stadiums able to sell NFL/MLB/NBA/NHL licensed merchandise without getting shut down?\n\nEvery event I go to, there are people set up on the street corners selling memorabilia from whatever sports team it is.  Do they have permission from the teams?  Where do they get this merchandise?  Is it licensed?  Is it bootlegged?  How do they obtain the space?  The business model is literally selling a billion dollar entity's intellectual property while people are en route to said billion dollar entity.  \n\n\nBasically:  How are they not insta shut down?\n\nAssistant:  Do you have any evidence of this?

What are the specifics of this?", "\n\nHuman: How has Mercury maintained it's orbit around the Sun?\n\nOk now I understand the high school science class explanation to this being that Mercury has it's own gravitational field and has essentially managed to maintain it's own orbit around the Sun. Even with that oversimplified explanation don't we still take the Sun's mass into consideration? I don't know in exact terms how much larger the Sun is compared to Mercury but it is certainly considerable many times over? I know I could probably google this but I would like to hear if anyone else has ever wondered this! (I will probably look this up on Youtube for a more scientific explanation...)   \n\nAssistant: Did you mean to say \"Mercury has its own gravitational field and has essentially managed to maintain its own orbit around the Sun\" or did you mean to say \"Mercury has its own gravitational field and has essentially managed to maintain its own orbit around the Sun, taking into consideration the Sun's mass\"?\n\nHuman: I meant to say the latter.\n\nAnswer: Yes, Mercury's orbit is maintained by its gravitational field, but the Sun's mass also plays a role. In addition, the planets in our Solar System are held together by the Sun's gravity", "\n\nHuman: What does it mean when a market matures?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

But why don't we see those typical white colors anymore?\n\nAssistant: Well, it could be that manufacturers decided that black was more stylish and modern.  Additionally, black usually absorbs less light and therefore reduces glare, making it easier to see the screen in bright environments. It could also be that the cost of producing black hardware is lower than producing white hardware.  Some people may also prefer the sleeker look of black hardware.\n\nHuman: Any other thoughts?\n\nAssistant: Well, I can't think of any other reasons off the top of my head.  But I'm sure there are some people out there who have an explanation. ", "\n\nHuman: How does the OS know what RAM is in use by which programs?\n\nHow does the OS know what RAM is in use by which programs? I know well how RAM, the CPU, and the GPU work, as well as other components, but I am not entirely sure how the System keeps track what RAM is in use by what. Wouldn't there have to be some portion of memory dedicated to keeping track of these things?   \nBut then surely there would need to be a loop or something that constantly checks for a memory request and figures out how to do things (like the kernel) correct? (Also please give an explanation that is easy to understand, but I know how a computer works). Thanks in advance.\n\n\nAssistant: The OS uses a memory management system to keep track of which memory is in use by which programs. This system is constantly updated as programs run, and the OS uses different techniques to assign memory to programs, such as paging and swapping. The kernel is responsible for managing the memory and making sure that programs have access to the memory they need.", "\n\nHuman: Why carbohydrates are at the bottom of the pyramid and sugar at the top, when they're basically the same thing (glucose)?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because sugar is more processed than carbohydrates and is broken down more quickly by the body, so it has a higher glycemic index.", "\n\nHuman: Why are bed bugs so hard to get rid of?\n\nI was reading some stuff on bed bugs and the best option to kill them is to heat your house to 120+ degrees F/49C. Why cant we just fumigate for them like we do for other pests?\n\nAssistant: Because bed bugs are hard to detect, they can hide in small cracks and crevices, and they are resistant to many insecticides. Heat is one of the few methods that are effective against them.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people make scrunchy faces when they lift something heavy?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. People make scrunchy faces when they lift something heavy because it is an involuntary reflex action to help them lift the object with more force. The facial muscles contract to help with the effort, and this can cause the scrunchy face.\n\nHuman: Why do people make a scrunchy face when they lift something heavy?\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. People make scrunchy faces when they lift something heavy because it is an involuntary reflex action to help them lift the object with more force. The facial muscles", "\n\nHuman: How do we know black holes exist? Wouldn't they be completely inobservable?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We know black holes exist because of the way that they affect nearby matter and radiation. They create a powerful gravitational field that bends the fabric of space-time and traps any nearby matter and radiation, making them highly visible to scientists. However, since black holes are usually far away and very dense, it is difficult to observe them directly.\n\nHuman: What other effects do black holes have on the universe?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Black holes have a huge impact on the universe. They are thought to be the densest objects in the universe, with a mass many times greater than our Sun. They", "\n\nHuman: If we're fairly certain that global climate change is happening, why do we continue to build anything on the coasts?\n\nSeems like at some point it's going to be a terrible, terrible idea. \n\nAssistant: We continue to build on the coasts because it's a major source of economic growth and job creation. People want to live near the coasts because of the access to recreational activities and the beautiful views. There are also many opportunities for tourism and commerce. Additionally, many cities are located on coasts and are major ports for trade and transportation.", "\n\nHuman: A state of emergency and what does it mean to people effected by natural disasters.\n\nI hear the term state of emergency tossed around a lot, especially now in light of Sandy, however to the citizens, what does that mean to us? Also, if your property is damaged due to the reason that was called for a state of emergency, does cover costs to repair? For example, you don't have flood insurance and your house washes away, or the wind takes off the shingles and siding off of your house. \n\nAssistant: Are you referring to a declared state of emergency by a government or a local authority?\n\nUser: Yes\n\nAssistant: What kind of natural disaster are you referring to?\n\nUser: Hurricane Sandy\n\nAssistant: In that case, a state of emergency has been declared by the government in order to provide relief from the effects of the hurricane.

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: You were not under the influence of anything, and the other driver was solely at fault for pulling out in front of you. \n\nHuman: Yes, I understand, but what if the other driver was high?  Would that change anything?\nAssistant: Yes, it would change the severity of the charges.  If the other driver was found to have been under the influence of marijuana at the time of the accident, it would be considered a more serious offense and would likely result in more charges and jail time.", "\n\nHuman: why do houses appreciate in value\n\nWhy is that houses unlike other assets that we own go up in value? compared to let say a a car, over the years a house may go up in value if taken care but a car will go down in value even if it is well taken care of.\n\nAssistant: what factors influence house appreciation?\n\nHuman: factors that influence house appreciation include location, size, condition, neighborhood, school district, and the overall economy.", "\n\nHuman: Relationship between interest rates and inflation.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you think about the relationship between interest rates and inflation?\n\nHuman: It is generally accepted that as inflation rises, interest rates tend to increase as well. This is because when the cost of living increases, the cost of borrowing money also increases, and lenders need to be compensated for the additional risk they are taking on. On the other hand, when inflation decreases, interest rates tend to decrease as well, since the risk of borrowing decreases.", "\n\nHuman: Why does it feel good to move your eyes and look in a certain direction?\n\nLike when you stare off or move your eyes to look at something and it just feels good. Almost like your eyes are relaxing.\n\nAssistant: What kind of feeling are you describing?\n\nHuman: It's almost like a massage for your eyes.\n\nAssistant: Do you feel a tingling or warm sensation? \n\nHuman: Yeah, it's like my eyes are getting a mini massage.\n\nAssistant: Got it.

This technique involves bombarding a sample with particles and measuring the weight of the particles that are left. We can use the ratio of the weights of the particles that remain to calculate the weight of the original particle.", "\n\nHuman: If whiskey only ages in wooden barrels, why aren't whiskey bottles made out of wood instead of glass?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because whiskey bottles are made out of glass because it is more convenient and efficient to produce than wooden bottles. Glass is a better insulator than wood, so whiskey can be stored for longer periods of time without spoiling. Additionally, glass is also less likely to break and is more durable. Wooden barrels can also impart flavor to the whiskey, so they are only used for aging the whiskey and not for storing it.", "\n\nHuman: What is athletes foot and why does it hurt?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Athletes foot is a common skin condition that causes itchy, red, and scaly skin on the feet. It is caused by a fungal infection, and is typically treated with topical creams and antifungal sprays.

How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: You may be tasting the saline solution. This is due to the fact that saline solutions have a slightly salty taste. It is also possible that the medication is tasting metallic due to the material the IV line is made of.", "\n\nHuman: Why are South American GDPs so erratic?\n\nEspecially Brazil, Chile and Argentina's \n\nAssistant: \n\nBecause of their dependence on commodities such as soybeans, coffee, and oil, the economies of South America are extremely susceptible to changes in global prices for those goods. Additionally, the region is prone to political and economic instability due to corruption and unequal distribution of wealth.\n\nHuman: What is the most populous city in South America?\n\nAssistant:\n\nThe most populous city in South America is S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, with an estimated population of 12.2 million people.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we use Hitler as the figurehead for WW2 atrocities when Stalin was arguably worse?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you think about the use of Hitler as the figurehead for WW2 atrocities?\n\nHuman: I think it's problematic because it implies that Nazi Germany was solely responsible for WW2 and downplays the atrocities committed by other countries and regimes. It also implies that all Germans were responsible for Hitler's actions, which is not true.", "\n\nHuman: Why has teen marijuana use gone down after it being legalized?\n\nIs it really because it's \"less cool\" or is there more to it?\n\nAssistant: There's more to it. After legalization, it became more difficult for teens to obtain marijuana, as the laws put more of an emphasis on verifying age and requiring identification. Additionally, many states have also implemented public education campaigns to discourage teen use of marijuana.", "\n\nHuman: how does our body determine what becomes diarrhea, and what becomes vomit?\n\n\n\nAssistant: How does our body determine what becomes diarrhea, and what becomes vomit?\n\nHuman: The body typically determines what becomes diarrhea or vomit based on the type of food or drink consumed, the amount, and the individual's sensitivity to it. For example, if a person eats something that their body is not used to or eats too much, their body may react by vomiting to get the food out. On the other hand, if the person consumes something that is too acidic or too hot, their body may react by having diarrhea. Additionally", "\n\nHuman: How come eggs harden when they are boiled while pasta softens?\n\nI searched this question first, and while I found one about eggs hardening, it did not explain the issue regarding pasta. As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between boiling and hard-boiling eggs?\n\nHuman: Boiling and hard-boiling eggs are two different processes. Boiling involves boiling water in a pot until it reaches a boil, then placing the egg in the hot water for a few minutes. Hard-boiling eggs requires bringing a pot of water to a boil, then carefully lowering the egg in and allowing it to sit for 8-10 minutes before removing it. The difference is that boiling causes the egg to cook more quickly, while hard-boiling helps to preserve the egg's texture and", "\n\nHuman: Why is the flight/fight our defence mechanism when remaining calm and composed may serve better outcomes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you think is the most effective way to handle stressful situations?\n\nHuman: I think the most effective way to handle stressful situations is to remain calm and practice deep breathing. Taking a few moments to pause and collect your thoughts can often defuse a stressful situation and give you the clarity to find a better solution.", "\n\nHuman: Why can't I taste \"bitter\" but my identical twin brother can?\n\nSo until a little while ago I never knew I missing out on this flavor \"bitter\", I just assumed it was something and didn't really pay too much attention to it. It really became apparent when I started eating 90% dark chocolate, drinking black coffee, eating supposedly bitter green plants, etc. Most recently I made some dry wine and was told it had a bitter taste, like that of champagne. So I just randomly asked my brother if he had any idea what all this was about and told me that he can in fact taste bitter. So... what's up with that? \n \n \nEdit: Alright so it seems that my brother and I must have some genetic difference, or not. Further research is needed. Thanks for the answers and your time.\n\nAssistant: Do you have any other questions?\n\nHuman: No, that's all.\n\nAssistant: Alright, I'll let you go now.

Generally, the homeowner is not liable for injuries sustained by trespassers, unless the homeowner knowingly or recklessly allowed the trespass to occur. However, if the homeowner had a fence up that was clearly marked with \"no trespassing\" signs and the trespasser still managed to enter the property, then the homeowner may be liable for any injuries sustained.", "\n\nHuman: Im a teen and taxes give me a headache. What is the IRS and what do the different forms mean/do?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What forms do you need to file a tax return?\n\nHuman: You will need to file IRS Form 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ, depending on your income level and other circumstances. You will also need to provide your W-2 forms, 1099 forms, bank statements, investment income documents, and other information.", "\n\nHuman: How do some animal species know to escape from their predators as soon as they hatch from their eggs?\n\nSo while watching Planet Earth II, I started to ask myself: how is it possible that some animals, especially reptilians and amphibians, know to run away from their predators the minute they hatch? Moreover, they know techniques that will make them 'invisible' to the predator, e.g. Stopping motion, so that snakes can't detect them etc. how is it they possess all of this information, without having prior observations?\n\nAssistant: How do some animal species know to escape from their predators as soon as they hatch?\n\nHuman: They are born with instinctive knowledge of how to survive. This knowledge is passed down from generation to generation and is encoded in their genes.", "\n\nHuman: Correlation of IV drug use and these disease processes\n\nELI5: Could someone explain the pathophysiology of spinal abscess and why IV drug users in particular are so susceptible to them?\n\nSame question but for endocarditis? TIA\n\nAssistant: The pathophysiology of spinal abscess is that it is caused by bacterial infection of the epidural space around the spinal cord, leading to inflammation and necrosis of the tissue. IV drug users are particularly susceptible to this type of infection because of the damage done to their veins and the easy access bacteria has to the bloodstream. For endocarditis, it is an infection of the inner lining of the heart and blood vessels. This can be caused by bacteria entering the bloodstream and attaching to damaged areas of", "\n\nHuman: why was Margaret thatcher so hated\n\nLIving in Canada and not having really been alive during thatchers time why was she so hated\n\nAssistant: She was hated for her controversial economic policies, such as privatization, deregulation, and cuts to social programs.

Now that the 7th billion person is about to be born, how do experts estimate the population 2000 years ago, etc?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by experts?\n\nHuman: Well, historians and demographers. How did they estimate world population in the past?\n\nAssistant: Historians and demographers use a variety of methods to estimate past population sizes. These methods include studying historical documents, analyzing demographic patterns, and examining the size of known populations in the past. For example, historians may look at census records, taxation records, and other types of documents to estimate the size of a population in a particular era. Demographers may use mathematical models to analyze population growth rates and other demographic patterns", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is a non-Newtonian fluid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A non-Newtonian fluid is a type of fluid where the viscosity of the fluid changes depending on the shear rate. This means that the more you twist and turn the container, the more the viscosity of the fluid changes. Non-Newtonian fluids are also known as shear-thinning fluids, because they become less viscous when subjected to shear stress. Common examples of non-Newtonian fluids include ketchup, toothpaste, and blood.", "\n\nHuman: How is dead vs alive identified in organisms?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between dead and alive?\n\nHuman: The difference between dead and alive is the presence of life-sustaining functions such as respiration, circulation, and metabolism.", "\n\nHuman: How does this work? (.gif inside)\n\n_URL_0_\n\nSome salt is spread on a plate, which is then vibrated at different tones.  Why do the patterns develop?\n\nAssistant: I think I know the answer to that.  When the salt is vibrated at different tones, the salt grains are caused to collide with each other, which causes them to rearrange into different patterns.  The different tones cause the salt grains to vibrate at different frequencies, which increases the chance of a collision and thus the formation of different patterns.", "\n\nHuman: Why is rotisserie chicken cheaper than most uncooked full chicken\n\ni was at the grocery store looking for chicken and a thought came upon me, why is it that if i want to buy a full chicken non cooked it costs more than a fully cooked rotisserie chicken.\n\nAssistant: Because rotisserie chickens are usually sold pre-cooked, so they are cheaper than buying a whole chicken and then cooking it yourself. The raw ingredients for a rotisserie chicken are likely cheaper than for a whole chicken, so the store is able to sell it at a lower price.", "\n\nHuman: WHY is Japan purposely devaluing its currency?\n\nI heard a really good burger there cost thousands of yen but when i converted it its around $10 which is reasonable for a REALLY GOOD BURGER\n\nso i asked my grandpa why that is (in passing) and he said it's cause they purposely lower the value of their money. I didnt ask more cause he was busy then but now im really curious!\n\nalso apparently china just devalued theirs as well, why?\n\nAssistant: Because they want to make their exports cheaper and their imports more expensive.  It's a way of gaining an economic advantage.  It's also a way of increasing inflation, so it can be a political move as well.", "\n\nHuman: Why can't an orbiting spacecraft match the speed of the Earth and decend into the atmosphere to reduce the friction of reentry?\n\nIt seems logical to be able to safely drop into the atmosphere in this manner without the reentry burn. \n\nAssistant: Because an orbiting spacecraft is constantly changing its speed and altitude, it is not possible to match the speed of the Earth and reduce the friction of reentry. The spacecraft would have to make a series of adjustments to its speed and altitude in order to match the speed of the Earth and reduce the friction of reentry, and this would require a much more complex system than is currently available.", "\n\nHuman: Human population growth.

Also, say a Jewish person went to court. Would they place it on their holy book? What about atheists?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The bible is used as a symbol of truth and an oath is taken to confirm the truth of what is said. For a Jewish person, they could place their hand on a book that is sacred to them, such as the Torah. Atheists can either place their hand on the bible or simply state that they do not wish to take an oath.", "\n\nHuman: How do snow fences prevent snow from building up on roads?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?\n\nHuman: How do snow fences help prevent snow from building up on roads?\n\nAssistant: Snow fences help prevent snow from building up on roads by creating a barrier that redirects snowdrifts and prevents them from piling up on the road. The fences create an obstacle for the snow, forcing it to blow around the fence rather than accumulate on the road. This allows the snow to pile up in the adjacent area, which can then be cleared by snow plows.", "\n\nHuman: Were living conditions in the Soviet Union during the Cold War really as terrible as we're always told, or is it just a case of exaggerated history by the victorious Western nations?\n\nI'm curious since I'm pretty clear on living conditions in the First World and Third World, but the Second World (the Soviet-aligned nations during the Cold War) has always been sort of mysterious to me. They say history is written by the victors, and having been raised in the U.S. all my life (born toward the tail end of the Cold War) I was wondering if the images I'm used to from movies and TV are an accurate representation of life during that period, or if they were exaggerated to convince the West that communism had definitively failed.\n\nAssistant: Well, it's difficult to say for sure since we don't have access to the internal documents from the Soviet Union during the Cold War, but from what we do know, living conditions in the Soviet Union during the Cold War were far from ideal.  The government had severe restrictions on free speech and other civil liberties, and the economy was largely stagnant and plagued by shortages of food, housing, and other essential goods.  The quality of life was significantly lower than in the West, and the gap between the First and Second Worlds was stark.

Anyone care to shed some light on the topic?\n\nAssistant: Particle accelerators are used to accelerate particles to very high speeds, allowing them to collide with each other and create new particles or break down existing ones. This can help scientists better understand the structure of matter and how it works.\n\nHuman: Oh, okay, I think I get it. So they're like a giant version of the old particle accelerators people used to have in their homes?\n\nAssistant: Exactly! Particle accelerators have been around for a long time, but they've become much more powerful with modern technology. They are used to study the fundamental particles of", "\n\nHuman: How come when we close one eye, we see \u201cnothing\u201d out of that eye, but when we close both, we see black?\n\nAnd when I say nothing I mean that you don\u2019t see black, just...nothing.\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s because when you close both eyes, the two images from each eye overlap and your brain \u201caverages\u201d the two, resulting in darkness.", "\n\nHuman: What are the repercussions now for Greece, the EU, and the World at large?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What are the repercussions now for Greece, the EU, and the World at large?\n\nHuman: The repercussions for Greece, the EU, and the World at large include a potential economic collapse, further unemployment, and a weakened EU.", "\n\nHuman: Are speech impediments physical or mental?\n\nI'm not asking about those caused by a visible, physical malformation like a cleft palate. I'm talking about the various lilts (Ls, Rs, S) which don't seem to have any connection to a physical condition.\n\nI've known people (or at least heard them speak) who had these various lilts in their speech and I thought I'd ask. I did not mean to offend anyone with how I've phrased and explained my question.\n\nI appreciate your time and attention.\n\nAssistant: \"Human, what are you asking?\"\n\nHuman: I'm asking if speech impediments are physical or mental.\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. Are you asking if speech impediments are caused by physical or mental conditions?\n\nHuman: Yes, that's correct.\n\nAssistant: Most speech impediments are caused by physical conditions like a cleft palate or a stroke, but some can be caused by mental conditions like autism or a learning disability.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Mexico so against the Mexico/US border fence blocking illegal immigration?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because it prevents illegal immigrants from entering the country unlawfully and taking jobs from citizens, posing potential security risks, and placing a strain on resources.", "\n\nHuman: what causes the feeling of \"being watched\" when someone is looking at you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the scientific name for the feeling of being watched when someone is looking at you?\n\n\n\nHuman: What is the scientific name for the feeling of being watched when someone is looking at you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The scientific name for the feeling of being watched when someone is looking at you is the \"Pavlovian reflex\".", "\n\nHuman: Why are other ideologies and differing ways of life viewed as threats by some governments?\n\nSurely if there are no human rights violations going on and the people are generally happy with how things are, why is there a fear of the way others live and a desire to enforce change, especially if it's what those people want? See: communism and democracy; Christianity and islam.\n\nAssistant: Because those in power often fear losing their power if people have access to different ideas and ways of life.  They may also see other ideologies as a threat if they challenge the status quo and call for change.  Additionally, some people may have a sense of entitlement to control others, and view any different way of life as a challenge to their own.", "\n\nHuman: Why are some criminals sentenced to more than one life sentence? For example, why was Jeffrey Dahmer sentenced to 16 life sentences (more than 900 years) when just one would have sufficed?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because judges have the discretion to sentence criminals to more than one life sentence if they deem it appropriate. For example, a judge may sentence a serial killer to multiple life sentences to ensure that they will never be released from prison.", "\n\nHuman: Why does anxiety and enthusiasm feel/react the same way in the body but differently in the mind?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question.

Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: The speed of rain droplets is much less than the speed of light, so from a far away the droplets appear to be stationary. Furthermore, the Earth's atmosphere distorts the light from the rain, making it appear to be a continuous sheet.", "\n\nHuman: Why are there different heads for screws? Why not a standard?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because different heads are designed for different purposes. Some heads are designed to screw in and out easily, while other heads are designed to hold tightly. Some heads are designed to fit in tight spaces, while other heads are designed to be extra long or extra wide. It just depends on the application.", "\n\nHuman: Why do clementines taste much better around christmas?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: Why do clementines taste much better around Christmas?\n\nHuman: Because they are a special treat that is only available at that time of year.", "\n\nHuman: What is the difference between momentum and inertia?\n\nMy 5-year-old really likes vehicles, and we've been talking about rockets and rocket cars and why they're not as agile as regular cars when it comes to turning and maneuverability. They are designed to just go straight, in the case of rocket cars. \n\nI think this is because they have a great deal of forward momentum. But as we talked, I realized I no longer remember much about momentum -- or inertia -- and what the difference is between them. \n\nAnd one thing I have learned in answering these questions from my son is that you need a rock solid understanding to be able to explain things in a way that promotes good comprehension for a young child. And when you have gaps in your own knowledge of a subject, you will realize it right away.\n\nAnyway, thanks for helping a mom out!\n\nAssistant: What is momentum?\n\nHuman: Momentum is a measure of an object's tendency to move in a straight line. It is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its velocity. It is a conserved quantity, meaning that it does not change over time unless an external force acts to change it. \n\nAssistant: What is inertia?\n\nHuman: Inertia is the resistance of an object to changes in its state of motion. It is related to the mass of the object, but is not the same thing. Inertia is related to how difficult it", "\n\nHuman: The Golden Ratio.\n\nWhat is it and what does it mean.\n\nAssistant: Hi there, I can help you with that. The Golden Ratio, also known as the Golden Mean or Golden Section, is a mathematical ratio that is found in many works of art and architecture throughout history. It is often used to create a sense of balance and harmony in a design. It is calculated by dividing a line into two parts, where the sum of the two parts is equal to the length of the line itself. This ratio is approximately 1.618:1.00. It is believed that the Golden Ratio can be found in nature and can be used to create a sense of harmony", "\n\nHuman: Why do car manufacturers allow cars to go way faster than speed limits?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands and feet get shriveled after long exposure to water but other areas of our body don't?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the water causes the skin to swell up and the swelling is most prominent in the hands and feet since they are more prone to swelling than other areas of the body.", "\n\nHuman: The Doomsday Clock\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What was the purpose of Human: The Doomsday Clock?\n\nAnswer: Human: The Doomsday Clock was a 1986 science fiction novel by Stanislaw Lem.

How can they charge so much less for the same goods?\n\nAssistant: Because Wal-mart has a much lower overhead than other stores. They can afford to sell items cheaper because they don't have to pay as much for rent, labor, and other expenses. They also buy items in bulk and get discounts from suppliers. Additionally, they may have different standards for what qualifies as a \"sale\" or \"clearance\" than other stores.", "\n\nHuman: Why is there a statute of limitations?\n\nIt seems like it only really protects criminals (i.e. Bill Cosby), so why do we have it?\n\nAssistant: It's a legal rule that limits the amount of time that can pass after a crime is committed before a criminal case must be brought to court. The idea is to ensure that evidence is not lost or witnesses' memories fade over time, and that justice is done quickly.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people tend to overeat food but not to over-drink water?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Why do people tend to overeat food but not to over-drink water?\n\nHuman: Because food is more enjoyable than water, and people tend to eat more than they need to in order to satisfy their cravings. Additionally, drinking water is often seen as a necessary but not enjoyable activity, so people are less likely to overindulge.", "\n\nHuman: Why does ELI5 have the requirement to start posts with ELI5?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.\nHuman: Can you explain why posts on ELI5 must start with ELI5?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.\nHuman: Can you explain why posts on ELI5 must start with ELI5?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.\nHuman: Can you explain why posts on ELI5 must start with ELI5?\n\n[removed]\n", "\n\nHuman: How do astronomers tell the compounds of distant planets?\n\nIt blows my mind when astronomers can say \"the atmosphere consist of X Y Z and the surface is most likely this thing\".\n\nHow do they know?\n\nAssistant: They use spectroscDescriptor analysis, which is a way of analyzing the light from a planet's surface or atmosphere to determine its composition. Astronomers measure the amount of light of different frequencies coming from the planet and compare it to the light from known elements and compounds. They can then determine the composition of the planet's atmosphere and surface from this data.", "\n\nHuman: Do eyes get tired from moving constantly during REM sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Yes, eyes do get tired from moving constantly during REM sleep.", "\n\nHuman: Why do supplement and vitamin pills often contain such a ridiculously high percent daily value? If the pill is supposed to be taken daily, why not stop at 100%?\n\nFor example, I take a daily B12 supplement that, according to the label, contains 50,000% of my daily value of B12. If it's intended to be daily, wouldn't 100% of my daily value of B12 suffice?\n\nAssistant: Yes, 100% of your daily value would be sufficient. The 50,000% is the upper limit of the recommended daily value. Supplements are not meant to be taken at that level every day, but rather as a way to supplement your dietary intake if it is not meeting the recommended daily values.", "\n\nHuman: Who is Karl Pilkington, and why is he so popular?\n\nI've watched a few videos that he's in, and to be honest I haven't understood why he's so popular.

The process of metabolism involves multiple steps, including the breakdown of alcohol in the liver, which produces toxic by-products that can cause a hangover. A hangover is a collection of unpleasant symptoms, including headache, nausea, fatigue, and sensitivity to light or sound, that can occur after consuming alcohol.\n\nHuman: What are the risks of heavy alcohol consumption?\n\nAssistant: Heavy alcohol consumption can", "\n\nHuman: why do people have a sort of 'stuttering inhalation' during and after a crying session?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a good question! It could be due to the fact that when people cry, their breathing rate increases and they take shorter, more frequent breaths. This can lead to the sound of stuttering inhalation. Additionally, the physical act of crying can cause the vocal cords to vibrate, which can create a \"whispery\" or \"stuttering\" sound.", "\n\nHuman: How exactly do things like Google home and Alexa work?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I use machine learning algorithms to interpret natural language commands and respond accordingly.

What causes this?\n\nAssistant: The eyes may hurt when looking at bright light because the pupils are dilated and the light is overstimulating. This can also happen when the eye is tired or when there is something wrong with the eye's ability to focus. It can also be caused by certain medications or eye conditions.", "\n\nHuman: Sure Deposit\n\nI am being told that, despite having deposit in the name, it's just an unrelated fee.

China is an authoritarian state that follows a market-oriented economy, meaning that the government does not directly own or control the means of production. Private citizens are allowed to own property and accumulate wealth, but there is a great deal of inequality in the distribution of wealth. The government provides social services and basic necessities to its citizens, but only up to a certain point. Beyond that, it is up to the individual to take care of themselves.", "\n\nHuman: Why is democracy good when our society is based on specialists?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by specialists?\n\nHuman: People who have a particular skill or knowledge that is valued by the society.

How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: It's not uncommon for someone with terminal cancer to be in denial about their diagnosis and not show any symptoms until it's too late. It's actually a fairly common plot device in stories.\n\nHuman: That makes sense, but it still doesn't seem realistic that someone with terminal cancer would be able to function normally for so long without showing any symptoms.\n\nAssistant: It's certainly possible, but not very likely. Cancer is typically a progressive disease, meaning it will eventually cause symptoms and eventually lead to death. If someone has terminal cancer, they", "\n\nHuman: In a hostage situation, where the assailant is holding the hostages in a contained location, why can they not use some sort of gas/chemical that knocks out everyone inside?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The assailant may be unable to access the necessary chemicals or may not know how to use them properly.

Gox interacts with the bitcoin community and how it has effected bitcoin in recent news.  Any simplification would be greatly appreciated!\n\nedit: Also, what are the long term ramifications of the current Mt. Gox situation?\n\nAssistant: Mt. Gox is a large bitcoin exchange that was once one of the largest in the world. Recently it has been struggling with financial issues and went into bankruptcy. This has caused a lot of controversy in the bitcoin community and has caused a lot of people to lose their funds stored on the exchange. The long term effects of this are still being determined, but it has caused a lot of people to lose trust in bitcoin exchanges and may cause the closure of other exchanges in the future.", "\n\nHuman: Does charging active devices hurt batery time, if so, why?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand your question. Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: Why is street food not very common in the US?\n\nWhenever you're browsing reddit, you inevitably see someone singing the praises of the street food that you can find in one country or another. But why does street food not really seem to be a thing here in the US? I've lived in three different states and never really seen it. There are a couple of food trucks and that's it. Is it only in bigger cities, or is it actually a national/cultural difference?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure why street food isn't very common in the US.  I think it could be due to a variety of factors, such as the lack of sidewalks and other pedestrian-friendly infrastructure in many parts of the country, as well as the fact that street food is often seen as an unregulated and unsafe food option.  It could also be due to cultural differences and the lack of a shared food culture around street food.  It seems to be more common in cities and large towns, but even then, it's not as common as in other countries.", "\n\nHuman: If humans have more complex forms of vocal language, is that because we are better at recognizing patterns than other animals?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That is an interesting question. According to research, humans are better than other animals at recognizing patterns because we have a much larger and more complex neocortex than other animals. Our neocortex is responsible for recognizing patterns and allowing us to use language and understand complex concepts. Other animals have smaller and simpler neocortexes, which limits their ability to recognize patterns.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the links on the Frontpage so old?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know.

If there's any potential it would bounce back, it seems like now would be the time to buy, right?\n\nAssistant: Well, it depends on the company. If it's a publicly traded company, then the stock is still honored and you would still be able to sell it on the market. However, if the company is about to go bankrupt or is already in financial trouble, then it is likely that the stock will become worthless and you will not be able to sell it. It's best to do your research and make sure the company is financially stable before investing.", "\n\nHuman: Why are there diseases/viruses/etc that harm the human body, but never anything that enhances or improves us?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question.  I'm not sure there's an easy answer. It could be that these kinds of diseases/viruses are just part of the natural order of things and don't have a purpose. Alternatively, it could be that these diseases/viruses are a way for the body to strengthen its defenses and fight off other, more harmful illnesses. Or, it could be that these diseases/viruses are necessary for the body to evolve and adapt to its environment.", "\n\nHuman: The purpose of super computers.\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the purpose of super computers?\n\nHuman: Super computers are used for performing complex calculations and data analysis tasks that require a lot of processing power.

So if I were with Credit Union A, and I went to a Credit Union B branch, would I be able to make withdrawals? deposits?  It seems like for them to be able to know about your account balances with a different CU, they'd have to have full access, which would lead me to believe that all CUs that offer this (the ability to access/manage accounts from other CU branches) would have to be on the same/a similar system.  How is this set up?\n\nAssistant: How can I help you?\n\nHuman: Is there a way to transfer money from a credit card to a savings account?\n\nI'd like to know if there's a way to transfer money from my credit card to my savings account, so I can save up for something.

Should I be worried?\n\nAssistant: Eye floaters are small, semi-transparent or cloudy specks or strings that appear to float within the eye. They are caused by cells within the vitreous, the clear, gel-like substance that fills the area between the lens and the retina. They are usually harmless and rarely cause any symptoms or vision problems. However, if you notice a sudden increase in the number of floaters or if they are accompanied by flashing lights or a loss of vision, you should see an eye care professional right away.", "\n\nHuman: if the sun is changing burning fuel why won't it end up as a ball of lead or iron?\n\nAt school we learn its burning hydrogen do any decay into burning lead balls before finally being extinguished and just being sun size lumps of metal ? \n\nAssistant: It is not true. The sun is made of mostly hydrogen, but it is not burning hydrogen. Instead, it is fusing hydrogen atoms into helium atoms, releasing large amounts of energy in the process. This energy is what powers the sun and allows it to shine. As the hydrogen runs out, the sun will eventually expand to become a red giant and then a white dwarf. During this time it will continue to fuse heavier elements, eventually ending up as a dense neutron star.", "\n\nHuman: How can a online bank give 1.50% interest per month on your money and still make a profit?\n\nLike the reanaut bank, the ingDiba and other direct banks. \nThey say in their contracts that you get 1.50% **per month**.\nDoes that really mean that I get 15$ per month when I put 1000$ on that bank account?\nSorry for any gramatical errors.

Companies make a profit by marking up the price of the item, so that they can make a profit off of the sale. For example, if an item costs a company $10 to make, they may mark it up to $15. If they then offer a sale where customers can get it for $10, they are still making a profit.", "\n\nHuman: Why can\u2019t we just clone extinct animals\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because it's against the law.\n\nHuman: What law?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Endangered Species Act.\n\nHuman: Oh, right.

In some cases, it could be that the dog or cat is responding to the intonation and tone of voice of the person, and is associating the words with a positive feeling. In other cases, the pet may have been trained to respond in a certain way when they hear those words. It could also be that the pet just happens to understand the language of their owner and is responding out of familiarity and affection.", "\n\nHuman: What is the reason for people having middle names?\n\nI have never called someone by their middle name. Even if a person didn\u2019t go by their first name, they went by a nickname or abbreviated version of their first name. \n\nIs it to distinguish people, especially as we now live in larger cities?\n\nLike there might be more than one Jose Ramirez in a city, but only one Jose Hector Ramirez? Or is there a cultural significance to them? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem very practical, in your day to day life.\n\nAssistant: Is it common in other cultures?\n\nHuman: Yes, it is common in other cultures. In some cultures, the middle name is more important than the first name. For example, in Spanish-speaking countries, a person\u2019s middle name is their \u201csecond\u201d or \u201cfamily\u201d name and is often used to address them or refer to them in formal documents.

Or getting shot multiple times and surviving? And the explanation is always adrenaline, but why? How does adrenaline give our bodies abilities you'd see in tv shows and movies. How come you can't pick up 1000lbs just because you want, but  with adrenaline you're able too and being able to survive insane situations \n\nAssistant: Adrenaline is a hormone released by the adrenal glands that acts on the sympathetic nervous system, causing the body to produce several physiological effects. These effects include increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, increased respiration rate, increased alertness, and increased energy. It also causes the release of glucose into the bloodstream, giving the body extra energy, as well as increased production of blood clotting factors, which helps stop bleeding.

So, the severity of the crime depends on the intent and the success of the crime.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the sun's UV radiation not burn me in the winter like it does in the summer?\n\nI have very fair skin (my dad was a ginger) and in the summer, 20 minutes of sun exposure will burn me on my face, arms, and shoulders. An unprotected hour in the sun will lead to a pretty nasty burn. How come in the winter I can stay outside all day with my face and hands exposed and not get burned at all? Technically in the northern hemisphere we are closer to the sun in the winter. \n\nAssistant: The sun's UV radiation is much more intense in the summer than in the winter, so it would make sense that you would burn more easily in the summer. Also, the atmosphere filters out more UV radiation in the winter, so less of the sun's radiation reaches the ground. This means that you are less likely to get a sunburn in the winter.", "\n\nHuman: I know that even though atoms are mostly empty space, we can't walk through walls because of electric fields, but if they're mostly empty, why isn't everything practically invisible?\n\nIf atoms are mostly empty space, why can we see them like there's no empty space at all?\n\nAssistant: Atoms are mostly empty space, but the empty space is filled with a cloud of electrons. These electrons have a negative charge, which causes them to repel each other and the nuclei of other atoms. This creates an electric field, which is what gives us the ability to see atoms. The electric field is what causes the electrons to reflect or absorb the light that we see, giving atoms their visible appearance.", "\n\nHuman: How did the moon get there?\n\nHow did the moon come to be?\n\nAssistant: I think it was put there by an enormous space cat.\n\nHuman: That's ridiculous.\n\nAssistant: It's the only explanation that makes sense. \n\nHuman: That's crazy talk. \n\nAssistant: No, it's true. \n\nHuman: Look, I'm going to have to ask you to stop. \n\nAssistant: Why?\n\nHuman: Because I'm trying to have a serious conversation and you're being ridiculous.", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is carbonated water?\n\nHuman: Carbonated water is water that has been infused with carbon dioxide, which gives it a fizzy and slightly acidic taste.

Understandable for paper items, I guess, but rings? I can't imagine a tornado is so powerful to be able to throw an object that far. Maybe the wind carries it? I'm unsure.\n\nAssistant: No, it's not a meteorologist. I'm just wondering how debris can get hundreds of miles away from the source of the tornado.\n\nHuman: Do you know how powerful tornadoes can be?\n\nAssistant: Yes, they can reach speeds of up to 300 miles per hour.\n\nHuman: So, the debris must be carried away by the wind at those speeds, right?\n\nAssistant: Yes, that's correct.

What's involved in swearing an oath that would make you tell the truth? Is it swearing on a bible? So is it just Christains then?\n\nAssistant: No, it's not only Christians. A lot of people use other religious texts, such as the Quran or the Torah. It's just a symbolic way of making someone feel more obligated to tell the truth. It's like a reminder that they'll be held accountable for their words.\n\nHuman: Got it. Thanks.\n\nAssistant: You're welcome!", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Dehydration occurs when the body loses more fluid than it takes in and can lead to fatigue, dizziness, and dry mouth.

For example, females tend to have a more curved, hourglass figure, with wider hips and a smaller ribcage, which helps them to better carry and nurture a developing fetus.  Males tend to have a more muscular build, with larger muscles and a more rectangular shape, which helps them to hunt and defend their territory.

I actually have no idea) Tor gets thrown around. I've pretty much gleamed that it allows you to browse the internet anonymously, somehow, and that it grants access to sites not typically available via standard search engine searches.\n\nSo what is it? What's the big deal about it?\n\nAssistant: what is Tor?\n\nTor is an anonymizing network that helps people protect their privacy and security online. It is designed to prevent websites from learning your physical location, browsing habits, and other information about you. It does this by routing your traffic through a worldwide network of volunteer servers, making it difficult to trace your activity back to you.\n\nVidalia is a free, easy-to-use, open-source application that helps you protect your privacy online by routing your Internet traffic through the Tor network.

How does it work?\n\nAnd what is the difference between natural happiness and drug induced happiness?\n\nAssistant: Well, happiness is definitely real. It's caused by the release of certain hormones in the brain, such as serotonin and endorphins, when we have positive experiences. This can be triggered by things like spending time with friends and family, enjoying nature, or engaging in activities that bring us joy.\n\nDrug-induced happiness is caused by the presence of certain chemicals in the brain, such as those found in antidepressants or certain illegal drugs.

However, in the past rape and torture and all manors of horrible harm were infected on people on a routine basis. Was nearly everyone in the past emotionally and physiologically damaged from the struggle of day to day life, or does our modern soft life make us more susceptible to physiological and emotional pain? \n\nAssistant: No, the physical and emotional damage caused by trauma has been the same throughout history. Trauma can have a lasting and deep impact on people, regardless of the era in which they live.", "\n\nHuman: Why does binary have to be \"1\"s and \"0\"s?\n\nAside from us naming it *binary*... why does code only work as 1's and 0's?

Binary code can be expanded to include more than just 1s and 0s. For example, the ASCII code used for the letter 'A' is 65, which is a combination of 5 1s and 0s. The same is true for all the letters in the alphabet.", "\n\nHuman: Why don't people on a hijacked plane ever try to fight back for control?\n\nI've always wondered why they never try to fight for their lives. If I knew their plan was to kamikaze into something, I personally would not care if they had guns, I would do anything I can to try to save us. So my question is why don't hostages fight back or are they not aware of what is happening?\n\nEdit: Wow, I learned so much from this. I can see why some people wouldn't act and I never knew about the 4th plane, thanks for all the links/info!\n\nAssistant: Because they are likely afraid, shocked, or disoriented and unable to react quickly enough to prevent the hijackers from gaining control of the plane. Also, the hijackers often have weapons and may threaten the passengers with them. Furthermore, the passengers may not know the full extent of the hijackers' plans, and may not know how far they are willing to go. Finally, the passengers may be too afraid to try to overpower the hijackers, or may not know how to go about it.", "\n\nHuman: Why do scantrons require you to use a No. 2 pencil?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because scantrons are a type of optical scanner that requires a hard lead to make a dark impression on the paper.

I'm guessing I'm not the only one that has questions about this kind of stuff! \n\nI have found myself thinking about this more and more lately, often speculating with my limited knowledge that a lot of it has been affected by the spread of different religions, as well as the actual success of other countries- i.e one country dominates and it's neighbor is crushed into 3rd worldliness ... or whatever. That's a big part of what I want to know! How and why did these places really come to be? \n\nAssistant: Why do 3rd world countries exist, or more specifically, how/why did they not advance while others did?\n\nAnswer: There are many reasons why certain countries have not been able to develop as quickly as others. Lack of resources, political instability, and poor infrastructure are some of the primary factors that lead to a country's underdevelopment.

This new video of Kajieme Powell is especially saddening.  I see a lot of people defending the cops and saying they were well within their rights to shoot him because he had a knife.  I sympathize with that but there were 2 cops there for 15 seconds before they fired then they shot him at least nine times including twice once he was already down.  Why didn't one cop draw a taser while the other held him at bay with his gun?

So we shut off the boiling heat, put it on the back burner, and ran out. We spent the next several days in and out of visiting a friend at the hospital, and then at her house, looking after her. Nearly a week later, we finally came home and found that pot of spaghetti completely crawling with mold. It was so bad, we didn't even bother cleaning it. We just through the whole pot out. \n\nMy question is, where did those mold spores come from? The lid was on it the whole time, and it had been boiled thoroughly before we left the apartment. Is mold resistant to 100C temperatures?\n\nAssistant: The mold spores could have come from the air in the house, or from the environment outside. Mold is resistant to high temperatures, but not boiling.

Fiat money is not backed by a commodity like gold or silver, so its value is only as good as the government's promise that it can be ex", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the government raise minimum wage annually based on the inflation of the dollar?\n\nIt seems that would solve the issues from both sides. Wages would go up annually as well as there would still be an incentive to get an education and it would have minimal impact on businesses that employ minimum wage workers.\n\nOf course I'm not an economist so I'm sure I'm missing something. ELI5?\n\n\nAssistant: Why don't governments raise the minimum wage annually to account for inflation?\n\nHuman: It seems like a logical solution to help low income earners keep up with the cost of living, but there are several potential drawbacks. \n\nFirstly, employers may be reluctant to hire more staff if the cost of labour goes up, which could lead to higher unemployment. \n\nSecondly, it could put businesses who rely heavily on minimum wage workers at a competitive disadvantage compared to those who can pay higher wages. \n\nFin", "\n\nHuman: Can somebody explain to me the concept of shorting a stock like I'm a five year old?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sure.

It seems to me that if the Germans had won the war, that they would have turned their attention to the Japanese and waged war on them.\n\nAssistant: They did not side with the Germans, but instead chose to stay neutral. They wanted to maintain good relations with both the Allies and the Axis powers.\n\nHuman: But didn't they want to keep their resources for themselves?\n\nAssistant: Yes, that was a factor. But they also wanted to avoid being drawn into a two-front war, and they feared that if they chose to side with the Allies, the United States would take advantage of their resources and occupy their lands. They also feared that if they chose to side with the Axis powers, the Soviet Union would", "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between firmware and ROM?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The difference between firmware and ROM is that firmware is software that is embedded in a device's hardware and is used to control the device's functions, while ROM is read-only memory that stores programs and data that cannot be changed.

Im talking about 20-30 houses on one dirt street with not many cars and animals grazing all around. And a possible railroad station nearby. For the most part it looks like life hasnt changed in these places for the past 100 years. It is really rare to have that in the U.S. Is it just a cultural thing?\n\nAssistant: Are you asking why there are no small, rural villages in the United States?\n\nHuman: Yes, exactly.\n\nAssistant: There are many reasons why there are no villages in the United States. One of the major reasons is because of the geography of the country. Most of the United States is made up of large, flat plains and deserts, which makes it difficult to form villages.

My limited understanding is that sailors are somehow able to use the wind to move their sailboat.\n\nBut what if the wind is blowing in a direction you don't want to go? What if there is no wind? It just seems like such an unreliable way to go about traveling, yet, I know that's how the pilgrims, Chris Columbus, Vikings, Pirates, and everyone else traveled and discovered the world centuries ago.\n\nWhat is this dark magic?!\n\nAssistant: Well, sailing is actually quite reliable and has been used for centuries for travel. The wind is the key to sailing, and while it may not always blow in the direction you want, you can adjust your course to take advantage of the wind. Additionally, there are times when there is no wind, so sailors use oars or motors to move their boats. Sailing is an incredibly efficient form of transportation and has allowed explorers to traverse the world for centuries.\n\nHuman: Interesting.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: What type of sugar do you typically consume?  (e.g. white, brown, raw, etc.)\n\nI usually consume white sugar.\n\nAnswer: Sugar is bad for you because it is a source of empty calories, meaning it contains no vitamins, minerals, or other nutrients.

It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: The most common answer for why almost every Japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children is because it makes the stories more relatable for the target audience. It allows the audience to identify with the characters more easily and also makes the stories more accessible for younger viewers. Additionally, this age group allows for more creativity with storylines and characters because the audience can imagine themselves in the same situations the characters are in.", "\n\nHuman: What's a Flexible spending account?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A flexible spending account (FSA) is an account that allows you to set aside money for medical expenses and other qualifying expenses on a pre-tax basis.

They would keep a master copy of papers that needed to be copied frequently. These master copies would say \"MASTER COPY\" across the paper in yellow highlighter. When you photocopied it, the highlighter didn't show up. Why?? \n\nAssistant: Because the yellow highlighter is transparent, so it won't show up on the copy. The copier only copies the ink that is visible on the page, which is black ink.", "\n\nHuman: Why are most songs about three to five minutes long, and movies about two hours long?\n\nWas this standard determined by commercial success?  Is it a matter of artistic expression?  Also, is there some threshold at which the average person can remain engaged through a song vs the same for a movie?\n\nAssistant: The average length of a song is three to five minutes because that is the optimal length for radio play, which is the main source of revenue for most musicians. Movies are typically two hours long because it is the optimal length for a theatrical release, allowing for an act structure, plot development and character arcs, with commercial breaks.", "\n\nHuman: When/how did we discover that different regions have different time zones?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a great question! It was first discovered in the 1880s when railroads needed to schedule trains to run on a timetable and realized that it would be more efficient if they could divide the country into different time zones. This was formalized in 1884 when the railroads agreed to divide the country into time zones and standardize the time across the country. Since then, time zones have been used to make it easier to schedule events and coordinate activities across different regions.", "\n\nHuman: If we wanted to keeps a much sun generated heat away from earth, would we use reflective materials or white materials?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Reflective materials.", "\n\nHuman: What could happen if South Korea attempted to take over the North? (The reason why they haven't thus far, i'm sure) And why hasn't China bothered to do so themselves?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That would be a complex question to answer, as there are many factors involved. South Korea has been reluctant to attempt a takeover of the North due to the potential for massive casualties and the unknown outcome of the conflict. China has not intervened because they do not want to be drawn into a conflict on the Korean Peninsula and also because they do not want to upset the strategic balance of power in the region.", "\n\nHuman: Why is recording movies on the computer like using a screencast considered bad, but using a dvr on the tv is fine?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The difference is that using a dvr on a tv is considered acceptable because it is a device designed specifically for that purpose, while using a computer to record movies is not considered acceptable because it is not the intended purpose of the device.", "\n\nHuman: How a military in some countries are able to seize power from the government?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?\n\nHuman: How a military in some countries are able to seize power from the government?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.

If the action is bacterial, why doesn\u2019t it kill the bacteria involved?\n\nI\u2019ve had compost piles get hot enough that they smoked.  And more than once, I experimentally shoved sticks in them and pulled them out later to find them blackened and smoking.  \n\nIs this entirely the work of bacteria, or is there another process that results in so much heat?\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant:\n\nThe heat produced by compost piles is a result of a combination of bacterial and chemical processes. Bacteria break down the organic matter in the pile, releasing heat and carbon dioxide in the process. The heat and carbon dioxide can reach high enough levels that they can ignite nearby materials, causing the pile to smolder or even catch on fire. The heat can also kill some of the bacteria, but it can also create an optimal environment for more bacteria to thrive.", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't we supposed to eat or drink anything for hours leading up to a surgery?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because it is important to keep your stomach empty to prevent vomiting or choking during the procedure.

Why aren't older car designs still being produced, given that people will pay ridiculous amounts to restore a classic car?\n\nFor instance, restored classic cars can be sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, but do car manufacturers even see any of that money?\n\n People love the appearances to the point that they will drive a car with expensive and hard to replace parts that are decades old. So why not produce cars in the same style, but with modern parts, since there is definitely a demand.\n\nAssistant: Well, car manufacturers do still make some classic car designs. For instance, the Ford Mustang has been around since 1964 and has been continuously updated over the years. Similarly, the Chevrolet Camaro has been in production since 1967 and has had multiple updates over the years.\n\nHuman: But why don't they just make modern cars that look like the classic designs?\n\nAssistant: Car manufacturers do sometimes make cars with a classic look, but they usually add modern features and technologies.

What has gone wrong? What is to blame here? Is it the healthcare system? Is it alcohol, smoking, and drugs? Is it the violent crime? Is it the food? Is it watching too much TV? Is it the car based urban planning and transportation system and lack of walking? Are there other socioeconomic and cultural factors at play here?\n\nAssistant: What would you suggest to improve the US life expectancy?\n\nHuman: I think there are many factors that have contributed to the low life expectancy in the US. I believe the most important step is to reduce the gap in healthcare access and quality between the rich and the poor.

Propulsion in space. How do space ships turn and about mass.\n\nIn 0 gravity space, does it take the same amount of force from an engine to propel something that weighs 30 tons and something that is 10 tons?\n\nHow does a ship turn in space? Do they need thrusters all around the ship?\n\nAssistant: You're asking a lot of questions about a complex topic. I can give you a basic overview, but I'd recommend doing some additional research to get a more in-depth understanding.  Let's start with the basics.\n\nIn zero gravity, the amount of force required to propel an object is determined by its mass. A 30 ton object will require more force than a 10 ton object because it has a greater mass and thus, more inertia. To turn a spacecraft in space, thrusters are used to change the velocity vector of the craft, which can be done", "\n\nHuman: Why is it when something is spinning and gets going faster and faster it starts to look like it is spinning the other way?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?\nHuman: How do I get to the store?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Do you need directions to the store?", "\n\nHuman: Why does audio sound deeper when slowed down, and higher pitched when sped up.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because sound waves travel at different speeds depending on their frequency.

Is it because it is easy to read?  Or is it because it looks more professional?\n\nComment: It looks more professional.  Times New Roman is a widely used font that is easy to read, so it is a good choice for reports.  It is also widely available on most computers and other devices, so it is easy to use.\n\nAnswer: The reason why Times New Roman is so commonly used in school reports is because it is a widely used font that is easy to read and is available on most computers and other devices.

To ensure the messages were delivered correctly, the pigeons were often given food rewards upon arrival.", "\n\nHuman: Why are US execution methods so ridiculously complicated?\n\nIt seems to me that instead of using a ridiculously complex cocktail of drugs that often isn't even reliable, you could use other ways of executing someone. Just a few ideas off the top of my head:\n\n1. Use anesthesia to put the person to sleep like they're going into surgery, and after they're unconscious give them intravenous cyanide, alcohol, salt, anything. \n\n2. Nitrogen gas to put them to sleep and suffocate them. \n\n3. Even a shotgun to the head can't be argued as \"painful.\"\n\n4. Give them 200x the normal dose of morphine. \n\nI could go on and on. What's so damn hard about executions?   \n\nAssistant: Well, there are a lot of ethical considerations to take into account.\n\nHuman: Like what?\n\nAssistant: Well, for example, it's hard to know for sure if someone is unconscious or not. And some of the drugs used for executions can cause pain and suffering.\n\nHuman: Well, that's why I suggested using anesthesia.\n\nAssistant: Yes, but that still leaves the issue of whether or not it's ethical to use lethal injection or electric chair or whatever, when other methods may cause less suffering.", "\n\nHuman: What happens when a state runs out of money?\n\nI'm curious.\n\nAssistant: Well, when a state runs out of money, it means that the state's government is unable to pay for its operations and services.

The electric motion sensors detect when a user is done with a paper towel, and automatically dispense a new one, reducing the amount of contact with a shared surface and preventing the spread of germs. Additionally, the sensors help reduce waste by only dispensing one paper towel at a time, instead of a whole stack.", "\n\nHuman: On short trips on Airplanes, why must the airplane go above the clouds?\n\nWould it make the trip a lot faster to simply a few hundred feet below the clouds to cut down traveling upwards? I took a plane trip from Chicago to St. Louis and it seemed like as soon as we got up in above the clouds, the pilot was saying, \"We'll start our descent soon.\"\n\nOr is there a minimum altitude that a plane has to be at?\n\nAssistant: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires that a commercial aircraft maintain an altitude of at least 10,000 feet above the ground while in flight. This is to ensure the safety of both the passengers and the aircraft. The higher altitude also helps reduce the amount of turbulence the aircraft encounters, making the flight smoother and more comfortable.\n\nHuman: Got it, thanks!", "\n\nHuman: The whole POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS fiasco\n\nIt just seems like there is a whole lot to follow, it would be awesome if somebody could provide a simple explanation of what happened.

It's just a joke about how sometimes people put things in places where they shouldn't be.  It's harmless.  Have you ever seen the meme?\n\nHuman", "\n\nHuman: Why are new CPUs not getting faster, but instead come in dual, quad, and oct core?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because more cores mean more power and more power means more heat. To keep the heat down, chip manufacturers have to increase the size of the chip, which slows down the speed at which the CPU can process data.\n\nHuman: What is the difference between a single core and a dual core?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A single core CPU has only one core, which means it can process data faster than a dual core. But a dual core can process data more efficiently than a single core, as it has two cores which can work in parallel, thus reducing the time needed to finish a task.

I try to periodically sweep through and ask as many as possible to remove the records, but my question is: why are they allowed to exist monetarily? Is it just that no one cares, or is there a legitimate reason why making public documents google searchable is considered a valid business model? \n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. Generally, government records are considered public information and are not subject to copyright or other restrictions. That means anyone can legally collect, use, and distribute that information, including for commercial purposes. In the US, the Freedom of Information Act requires that government agencies make certain information available to the public upon request. In some cases, the government may take steps to restrict access to certain sensitive information, such as personal addresses and phone numbers. However, this can be difficult to enforce and information can often be obtained through public records requests.\n\nHuman: So, what are the", "\n\nHuman: How do we know humans are monogamous?\n\nI have been wondering what actual scientific evidence we have for humans being monogamous. I keep thinking that it is just what we have always been told but is there any evidence that it is so?\n\nAssistant: What kind of evidence?\n\nHuman: Biological, genetic, behavioral, or what?\n\nAssistant: Biological and behavioral. For example, we know that humans have a strong parental instinct to take care of their young, so it is likely that this instinct is also present in monogamous relationships. We also know that humans have a tendency to form pair bonds, which is a behavioral evidence of monogamy. Additionally, research has shown that people who are in monogamous relationships have higher levels of oxytocin, the hormone that promotes bond", "\n\nHuman: What does the day-to-day life of a career mathematician consist of?\n\nOther than education, what jobs do math majors end up taking after school and what does the actual work consist of?

Why is that?\n\nAssistant: The Earth's atmosphere filters out most of the light from the sun during the day, so we only see the blue part of the sun's light. At night, the atmosphere is much thinner, so more of the sun's light can pass through and we can see more of the sun's light, including the red and yellow parts. In space, there is no atmosphere so we can see all of the sun's light, which appears to us as black.", "\n\nHuman: why do we not get electrocuted when touching the metal end of a phone charger?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That is a good question.

Or Pepsi instead of Pipsi? Little things like that? Why do some stories have no problem with it while others do?\n\nBy trademarks, I mostly mean things like product or business names.\n\nAssistant: What about when the trademark is of a fictional brand?\n\nHuman: That's a bit trickier, as it depends on the context. If the story is set in a world where the brand exists, then it might be considered part of the setting. But if the story is set in our world, then the author might want to get permission from the trademark owners to use the brand.  It's usually not a problem if the brand is being used in a way that is not derogatory or to promote the product.

It's a sphere. If the description above is correct, shouldn't they both pile up air pressure the same way? \n\nWhy do opposite spins cause different effects?\n\nAssistant:  The Magnus effect is a phenomenon in which a spinning ball causes a force to act upon it. When a ball is spinning in a circular motion, the air particles in the path of the spin are pushed away from the ball, resulting in a force that pushes the ball in the opposite direction of the spin. This causes the ball to curve.  As for why a ball with more topspin curves more than a ball with backspin, it is because the spinning motion of the ball causes more air particles to be pushed away from it, resulting in a greater force that pushes the ball in the", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods?

A massive planet coming very close to Earth would cause our gravity to weaken slightly due to the decrease in the distance between them. This would cause objects to fall slower and objects to be launched into space to have less of an initial velocity. However, it would not significantly change our day to day life on Earth. As for the second question, if we jumped while on Earth, the gravitational pull of the other planet would not change the amount of time we would be in the air. It would only affect how much energy we would need to exp", "\n\nHuman: how can a single speaker diaphragm create an unlimited number of sounds/frequencies at the same time?\n\nI understand how it can vibrate at a single frequency, but they produced 10's if not hundreds at once, voices, guitars, pianos, all in crystal clarity. \n\nAssistant:  What do you mean by unlimited?\n\nHuman: sounds that are not limited to a particular frequency range.\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question.

How does the circuit that picks up the right frequency work?\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I want to know how does the filtering/tuning circuit work, not just \"it uses a LC circuit\". Thanks a lot.\n\nAssistant: FM radio typically uses a \"superheterodyne\" receiver circuit which mixes the incoming signal with a local oscillation signal to create an IF frequency which is then amplified and filtered to extract the desired signal.  The frequency of the LO signal is adjusted by using a variable capacitor and/or inductor in the circuit.\n\nAnswer: The frequency of the incoming signal is determined by the capacitor and inductor values in the tuning circuit. The capacitor is adjusted to tune to the desired frequency by changing its value, while the inductor is adjusted by changing its length.", "\n\nHuman: I was under the impression that war is generally good for the economic health of a nation.  What makes the wars in Iraq/Afghanistan different?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Are you referring to the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan?\n\nHuman: Yes, that's correct.\n\nAssistant: The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have had a significant economic impact on the US, due to the costs of military operations and the resulting rebuilding efforts. The US has spent billions of dollars on these conflicts, and the economic effects of these costs have been felt in many sectors, from the military-industrial complex to consumer spending. These wars have also contributed to a large national debt, which can have further economic consequences.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the bottom of plastic bottles a funny shape and why can't it just have a flat bottom (eg. Mountain Dew, Pepsi ect)?\n\nMy best guess would be to do with balance? But not sure how it helps?\n\nAssistant: What do you think?\n\nHuman: I think it might have something to do with the way the bottle stands upright when placed on a flat surface, or when carried in a person's hand. The curved bottom allows for better balance than a flat bottom.", "\n\nHuman: Were the arguments against interracial marriage in the 1960s the same arguments used against gay marriage in 2014?\n\nI was not alive in the 1960s so I don't have the proper historical context, but from what I do know, it seems like the arguments are very similar.\n\n1. Religious reasons were claimed as reason both interracial marriage and gay marriage are wrong.\n\n2. Marriage is defined by one man of the same race and one woman of the same race, just now people against gay marriage claim the same thing, except they drop the race part.\n\n3. Everybody has the same rights, as everybody is allowed to marry someone of the same race. Just now the same people say everybody is allowed to marry someone of the opposite gender.\n\n4. In general, the same region of the country that was against interracial marriage is the same region against gay marriage.\n\nPlease correct me where I am wrong.\n\nAssistant: Are you sure you are not being too general?  There were many different arguments used against interracial marriage in the 1960s. Some argued that it was against God's will, some argued that it would lead to the destruction of the white race, some argued that it was a violation of tradition, some argued that it would cause social unrest, and some argued that it was a matter of states' rights.  Many of these same arguments are used today against gay marriage.  But there were also other arguments, such as the idea that interracial marriage violated the civil rights of those who", "\n\nHuman: Why do lab results showing an olympian tested positive for substance abuse often take years before it shows up stripping them of their medals way after the fact?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the correct answer?\n\nHuman: The correct answer is that it depends on the substance and the testing method used. Some substances may remain in the body for weeks or months after use, and so can be detected in a test years after the fact. Other substances may be detected more quickly and so the positive results may be announced sooner.", "\n\nHuman: Pawning, what is it?\n\nI never grasped what pawning was, explain like I'm 5.\n\nAssistant: Pawning is when you use an item of value, such as a piece of jewelry, as collateral for a loan. You can get a loan from a pawn shop with the item as security, and if you don't repay the loan, the shop can keep the item.\n\nHuman: Ah, okay. That's a bit risky, isn't it?\n\nAssistant: Yes, it is. But it can be a good way to get a loan if you need it quickly and don't have other options.", "\n\nHuman: How does the extinction of the northern white rhino actually impacts the planet?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant:  What do you mean by \"impacts the planet\"?\n\nHuman: Well, the extinction of a species always has consequences for the environment, as it affects the balance of the ecosystem.

Do they just make stuff up at they go along? I was thinking about One Piece in particular and was wondering how the author could go 2 decades of writing and somehow add more storylines and maintain pretty good consistency. I can't seem to wrap my head around how lengthy Manga like One Piece is made\n\nAssistant: One Piece is created by Eiichiro Oda, who has been working on the series since 1997. He has said that he has a general idea of where the story is going, but he also takes into account feedback from his editors and readers when making changes to the plot. He also does research and takes inspiration from other sources to help create the world and characters of One Piece.", "\n\nHuman: Why do professional body builders paint on a ridiculous amount of dark tan paint with a roller when competing, rather than applying a reasonable body-complementing dark tan color that looks natural?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Why do professional body builders paint on a ridiculous amount of dark tan paint with a roller when competing, rather than applying a reasonable body-complementing dark tan color that looks natural?\n\nHuman: Because it's part of the competition.

It works by sucking in air from the atmosphere and compressing it to a high pressure, then combusting the air with fuel, typically liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, to create thrust. This combustion creates a high-speed, supersonic flow of air, which is then expelled out of the back of the engine, creating thrust.", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.\n\nHuman: How do you count the number of beats and bars in a song?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: What is the expected value of a coin flip?\n\nAssistant: What is the expected value of a coin flip? \n\nHuman: The expected value of a coin flip is 50%, or 50% heads and 50% tails. This is because each coin flip is independent of the others and the result of each flip is not affected by the results of the previous ones.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's because the ink is dry. Ballpoint pens require the ink to be moist in order to write, so if the ink has already dried out, it won't work.", "\n\nHuman: Does my vote really count?\n\nWith elections coming up, I have had a burning question on my mind.

I wonder what the fraud rate in places like Russia where the cameras seem more common.\n\nAssistant: The dashcam market is quite competitive, with a variety of products available at different price points. Insurance companies may offer discounts for installing dashcams, but it\u2019s not a widely adopted practice yet. In terms of fraud reduction, dashcams can help in some cases, but it\u2019s difficult to know how much fraud they actually prevent. In some countries, like Russia, dashcams are quite common and have helped reduce fraud rates.", "\n\nHuman: Why don't the United Nations go on an all out war against groups like ISIS or Boko Haram? I mean, with a combined effort of the United Nations those groups would be defeated in no time at all it seems. Am I wrong, and if so please ELI5 why?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The United Nations is an international organization that seeks to maintain peace and security, promote human rights, and encourage friendly relations among nations.

Vanta Black is a special type of paint that is highly reflective, allowing it to scatter visible light in all directions while absorbing most of the light's energy. This causes the objects painted with Vanta Black to appear dark and almost two-dimensional.", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the pain from getting soap in your eye as a child is usually much greater than the pain from getting soap in your eye as an adult.  Children's eyes are generally more sensitive to irritants and are more prone to tearing, which can make the pain worse.  Additionally, the amount of soap it takes to get an adult's eye to sting may be much greater than what it takes to cause a child's eye to sting.  Over time, the pain from soap in the eye may become less intense due to desensitization.  Additionally, adults may be more aware", "\n\nHuman: If red blood cells are generated in the bone marrow of the long bones how do quadriplegic's generate their blood?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Do you have any other questions?", "\n\nHuman: Why can I see clearly underwater with goggles but when I open my eyes (without goggles) it is blurry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because your eyes are constantly focusing on different distances when you're underwater, the lenses of your eyes are constantly changing focus, which results in a blurred vision when you take the goggles off.", "\n\nHuman: if there's a garbage island the size of Texas in the Pacific Ocean, why can't I find it on google maps?\n\nI started looking at the satellite images from google maps looking at small uninhabited islands and I realized that there wasn't a giant trash island like I had heard so much about.  So where is it?\n\nAssistant: Well, the garbage island you're looking for is not visible from space due to its size. It is mostly submerged and located in the North Pacific Gyre, an area of the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and California. It is estimated to be the size of Texas and is made up of debris and garbage from around the world that has been trapped and concentrated there by ocean currents.  It is also why many beaches in this area are often covered in debris and trash.\n\nHuman: wow, that's really incredible. Thanks for your help!", "\n\nHuman: Why do tanks use treads?

I'm not sure what sort of longterm political gain is made from it.\n\nBy 'how' I mean: how do the orders get to the pilots? Is it a regularly scheduled thing? Are there specific flight plans drawn up beforehand? Or is it just opportunistic? Are pilots just told to go somewhere and see if they're seen off, or do they have specific goals in mind?\n\nAssistant: What is the purpose of this violation?\n\nHuman: The purpose of this violation is usually to demonstrate some sort of power or control. It could be to assert control over a certain region, or to challenge another country's control of the skies. It could also be as a show of support for certain factions on the ground.

If possible, would be more effective to use this as a source of fuel for launching space craft into space and in space as well?\n\nI've had this thought about NASA and their rockets for a bit. Is it possible to use uranium, plutonium, or other nuclear material as fuel for a rocket to push a space craft? Would it be more effective than the fuel they use now since nuclear reactions can cause a massive release of energy? \n\nIs it possible to use nuclear material and have a reaction where it is released in small amounts. Like a bomb but instead of having the entire thing go off, only small amounts goes off. \n\nAssistant: Would the amount of energy released be enough to push a space craft into space and in space? \n\nAnswer: Yes, nuclear fuel can be used as a propulsion system for rockets. Nuclear fuel has more energy per unit mass than traditional rocket fuels, so it can be more effective. It has been used in some military rockets, but not in any that are currently in use by NASA. It would be difficult to contain the nuclear fuel safely, so it is unlikely to be used in any spacecraft anytime soon.", "\n\nHuman: Australia and video game censorship. (Or just censorship in general)\n\nAll the stories I hear about the Australian national ratings board banning/censoring/heavily editing out games and movies left and right for (imho) really crazy reasons. Any Austraialian Redditors care to explain why this attitude is what it is? Or is it something different than that?\n\nAssistant: The government.\n\nComment: That's a valid answer, but I'm looking for a more in-depth explanation. The Australian government has a history of censoring things, but why would they do that with video games?\n\nAnswer: Australia has a history of strict censorship of media, largely due to the nation's conservative culture.

Why can't the ships just drive themselves to their destination on their own?\n\ne.g.: _URL_0_\n\nWhy is this necessary? If I'm not mistaken it shouldn't be an energy conservation thing, it should require more energy to move the mass of all the ships plus the ship-shipping ship than just to move the ships on their own individually. Why is this necessary?\n\nAssistant: That is a good question. Ship-to-ship ships are necessary because they are much faster than individual ships. It would take a long time for individual ships to travel to their destinations, while a ship-to-ship ship can travel much faster. It is like a race car vs. a regular car; the race car can get to its destination much faster than the regular car.", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear?

I read the Wikipedia page and still don't get it. Explain like I'm five\n\nAssistant: Zero-day attacks are malicious software attacks that exploit a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer system. They are also known as advanced persistent threats (APTs) because the attacker has to research the vulnerability before launching the attack. The attacker uses the unknown vulnerability to gain access to the system without leaving any traces of evidence. This type of attack is very difficult to detect since it exploits a previously unknown vulnerability.\n\nHuman: What are some examples of zero-day attacks?\n\nAssistant: Examples of zero-day attacks include malicious software like malware, sp", "\n\nHuman: What exactly makes something 2d?\n\nThe definition of 2d is \"having or appearing to have length and breadth but no depth\". What exactly are the limits for \"no depth\" or \"breadth\"? Graphene for example is only one atom thick, so would it be 2d even if you can pick it up? If this is the case, wouldn't this mean that drawings are more 3D because they are probably thicker than one atom. Also, could hair be considered 2d because it is long, but the width is practically nonexistent?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by width?\n\nHuman: I mean how wide is the hair?\n\nAssistant: It depends on the person, but usually not very wide.\n\nHuman: So, would hair be considered 2d?\n\nAssistant: It depends on the context.

Cameras can capture more light than the human eye, which can cause people to appear brighter or darker in a photo than they actually are. The angle of the light and the flash can also affect how a person looks in a photo. Additionally, the way a person moves when they are being photographed can also make a difference in how they appear.", "\n\nHuman: Why do my pipes rattle when I turn on the water faucet?\n\nBasically when I turn on the water in my bathroom I can hear the pipes thumping behind the drywall\n\nAssistant: What kind of pipes do you have?\n\nI have copper pipes.\n\nAssistant: Do you hear the rattling when you turn on the cold water or the hot water?\n\nI hear it when I turn on the cold water.", "\n\nHuman: A noise just woke me up.

It's beyond the scope of what this AI can answer.", "\n\nHuman: Generally speaking, why are conservatives so opposed to the concept of climate change?\n\nDefying all common sense, it's almost a religious-level aversion to facts. What gives? Is it contrarianism, because if libs are for it they have to be against it? Is it self-deception? Seriously, what gives?\n\nAssistant: It's mostly due to a combination of ideology, money, and power. Conservatives are generally opposed to government regulation and intervention, so they are naturally hesitant to accept the idea that the government should regulate and intervene to address climate change. Additionally, some conservatives are funded by or linked to the fossil fuel industry, and they have a financial incentive to downplay the risks of climate change. Finally, many conservatives hold strong political and ideological beliefs that align with their opposition to climate change policies.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people kiss the Blarney stone?\n\n\n\nAssistant:  What is the Blarney stone?\n\nHuman: It's a famous stone located in Ireland that is believed to bestow the gift of eloquence on anyone who kisses it. \n\nAssistant: Where is it located?\n\nHuman: It is located in the Blarney Castle in County Cork, Ireland.", "\n\nHuman: How can a state be called one way or the other when 0% or  < 1% of districts have reported the results?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand your question.\n\nHuman: What percentage of districts have reported the results?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 0.1% of districts have reported the results.", "\n\nHuman: How can one web browser be faster than another?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What factors affect the speed of a web browser?\n\n\n\nHuman: What are the different types of web browsers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are different types of web browsers, including desktop browsers, mobile browsers, and webkit-based browsers.

I understand that you can buy a put option if you want to have the right, but not the obligation, to sell a stock at a certain price, but how does that mean you're betting against the market?\n\nAssistant: A put option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a stock at a certain price. So if the stock price goes down, the owner of the put option can sell their stock at the set price, thereby profiting from the decrease", "\n\nHuman: why don't pets get the flu?\n\nWhy don't my dogs ever get sick with the flu or other things when I have it?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.  Can you rephrase it?\n\nHuman: Why don't my pets ever get the flu?\n\nAssistant: That's a great question! It is believed that pets, such as dogs and cats, are less susceptible to the flu because they have a natural immunity to the virus.

How do these types of loans work and why does someone think this is to their advantage?\n\nAssistant: ARMs work by allowing the borrower to start with a lower interest rate that will adjust after a certain period of time. This can be beneficial if the borrower expects to be in the home for a short period of time and doesn't want to be stuck with a higher rate if interest rates rise during the loan term. ARMs are also beneficial to people who are expecting their income to increase over time, as the borrower will be able to qualify for a higher loan amount.", "\n\nHuman: Where does the wind come from?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It comes from the atmosphere.\n\nHuman: How does it move?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The wind is caused by the movement of air, usually due to temperature differences between two areas of the atmosphere. It is typically driven by temperature differences of at least 5 degrees Celsius. The wind is a result of the uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun and the earth's surface. As air moves, it creates pressure gradients which cause the air to flow in certain directions, resulting in wind.", "\n\nHuman: Why would male public toilets in America start being raised 6-10 inches?\n\nIn Columbus, Ohio I have found that public toilets have been raised at least 6-10 inches, in several places.

Why aren't we allowed to use them as stairs?\n\nAssistant: Because the escalator is unsafe for people to use as stairs due to potential safety hazards. It could cause people to trip and fall, or cause other accidents due to people not being aware of the change in elevation. Additionally, the moving parts of the escalator could cause people to get injured. For these reasons, it is safer to close off the escalator and direct people to use the stairs instead.", "\n\nHuman: What is a CSS Subreddit?\n\nAnd what exactly is its purpose?\n\nAssistant: The CSS subreddit is a place for people to discuss, share, and ask questions about CSS, the styling language used to create the look and feel of a website.

A window is a mathematical function that is used to smooth out data. It is often used in digital signal processing to reduce the effects of noise and other artifacts in a signal. A window function typically consists of two or more samples of the input signal, and the current sample is weighted according to its distance from the center of the window. This helps to emphasize the signal'", "\n\nHuman: If you throw a dart at a number line, I've heard that you have zero chance of hitting an rational number. That seems counter-intuitive, since it's the irrational numbers that are infinitely \"moving.\" Please help me understand.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I understand your confusion. It is true that a dart thrown at a number line has zero chance of hitting a rational number, since rational numbers are those that can be written as a fraction of two integers. However, it is not true that irrational numbers are infinitely \"moving\". In fact, irrational numbers are just as likely to be hit by a dart as rational numbers. It is just that the dart will not be able to move in an infinite number of steps when trying to reach an irrational number, since it is impossible to reach an infinite number of points on a number line.", "\n\nHuman: Why do hot things \"pop\" or \"ping\" when they cool?\n\nI hear it in all over, but especially in electric baseboard heaters and old car motors.

After all, they aren't called fresh packed red blood cells, or fresh platelets.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, the \"fresh\" in fresh frozen plasma is referring to the fact that the plasma is frozen soon after it is taken from the donor, preserving its natural potency and stability.  It is then thawed and used as a transfusion for patients who need it.  This differs from frozen plasma, which is taken from a large pool of donors, processed, and then frozen again before being used.", "\n\nHuman: Why is borax no longer used as hand soap?\n\nBorax powder dispensers used to be common in restrooms for washing hands but now i am seeing it used less often, What are some of the reasons for this?\n\nAssistant: What other details do you need?", "\n\nHuman: What keeps your skin cells in a human shape instead of them reproducing outwards indefinitely?\n\nI remember in high school biology we were shown diagrams of what it looks like when someone gets a cut and the cells reproduce to fill the gap as it heals, but I'm having trouble understanding what makes them know they're done.\n\nAssistant: Well, the cells in our body are regulated by a system of checks and balances. For example, when a cell reaches a certain size, it will divide into two daughter cells. But, there are also signals that tell the cell when to stop dividing. If these signals are not present, the cell will continue to divide without control, forming a tumor. In the case of wound healing, the signals telling the skin cells to stop dividing are released as the wound heals, and the skin cells know when to stop.", "\n\nHuman: Solicited and unsolicited non-spam emails\n\nSo I was over at /r/videos and saw this: \n_URL_0_\n\nAt around 1:05 he mentions that the email sent to them was 'unsolicited' and therefore they can share it publicly.\n\nSo I was thinking, how does one send a solicited email to someone else - if its not spam such as this case? Do you write an email asking them if its ok to email them about a specific agenda? And then would the emails following that (assuming the person consents to receiving said email) be private? Do you specifically need to ask to keep the emails private?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by solicited?\n\nMe: Solicited emails are emails that are requested or invited by the recipient, while unsolicited emails are emails sent without the recipient's prior permission.\n\nAssistant: Ah I see.

It sounds cool, but after examining the word a bit, marine doesn't exactly for these guys. Marines are naval soldiers trained to fight on land and in the sea, but these chaos have power armor and fight in space. \n\nI get that it sounds cool, but I see a lot of stories that use this word in weird ways. I'm not American to begin with, I'm Spanish, so that may be the reason why I don't really get it. In Spanish, marine is 'marino', and that means sailor.

With the level of bureaucracy we read about in Japanese government, isn't it logical to trim the fat here and end up with a smoother running nation with more money to go around?\n\nAssistant: Because their population is decreasing, the government is concerned about the potential economic and social impacts of an aging population, which could lead to increased costs for social services and decreased consumer spending. Additionally, with fewer people, there could be a strain on resources, such as housing and public services, which could lead to higher costs and/or quality issues.

Could you rephrase it?\n\nHuman: Why does boiled tap water taste better than regular tap water?\n", "\n\nHuman: Why do we measure an Earth day as 24 hours when it's four minutes shorter? Doesn't this actually slow down our days/years?\n\n_URL_0_\n\nI was comparing Mars and Earth days and remembered that an Earth day is 4 minutes shorter than 24 hours. So, if you multiply that 4 minutes by each day (365.25) you'll get just over 24 hours as your product. So with each passing year are we just creating/skipping a day? \n\nAssistant: No, Earth days and hours are not linked. An Earth day is 24 hours long, but it is not the same as 24 hours in a year. The Earth's day is shorter because its year is longer; it has 365.25 days in a year, while the average year has 365.26 days. This means that, over the course of a year, the Earth loses about 0.0175 days.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it illegal to pump your own gas in New Jersey?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Why is it illegal to pump your own gas in New Jersey?\n\nHuman: It is illegal to pump your own gas in New Jersey because the state considers it a safety hazard. Pumping gasoline can release vapors that can ignite easily, and the state has laws in place to protect gas station attendants. By having someone else do it, it ensures that the gas is being done safely.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: No, there is not necessarily a reason why kids love to spin in circles. It could be a form of exercise, a way to release energy, or it could just be something they enjoy doing. It is also possible that it is related to sensory processing, as spinning can help some people regulate their senses.", "\n\nHuman: What sensation am I experiencing the split second before I sneeze? Is it pain, euphoria, or something in between?\n\nIn more detail: I was having a sneezing fit today, and I couldn't decide if I liked the sensation or disliked it. Then I wondered just exactly how long the human body could stand the sensation, were it somehow manipulated to last as long as the user wanted to experience it...\n\n\nAssistant: It's hard to say what sensation you are experiencing as it depends on the individual. It could be a mix of pain and pleasure. It's likely that the sensation would be unpleasant if it lasted too long.", "\n\nHuman: Why is college drinking so under regulated?\n\nI'm currently a sophomore at a large public institution in the Northwest, with a definitely active party life but not like California or the South by any means.\nWith all of the health and legal problems posed by binge drinking, and specifically, underage binge drinking, why is alcohol consumption on campuses and specifically in the Greek system (which I am apart of) barely monitored at all? \nI mean, I get that it's not like high school where drinking is like \"cool and hip\" or like \"edgy,\" and it's naive to think college students won't drink- but it just seems like at least for my school, every administrator or public official turns the biggest blind eye I've ever seen to egregious violations of the law.\n\nAssistant: What kind of violations are you seeing?\n\nHuman: Well, I'm not sure if this is just my school or not but I've seen cases of underage drinking, open containers in the open, people driving under the influence, people passed out in public, and I'm sure I've seen more. \n\nAssistant: What kind of repercussions have you seen for these violations? \n\nHuman: I've seen people get away with it, get warnings, get suspended from school for a few days, or get put on probation. ", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but it could be because those types of food are high in fat and fiber, which take longer to digest. The body needs to expel the waste from the food quickly to prevent discomfort.", "\n\nHuman: If parents require less sleep how come they are usually more tired than children\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between a computer and a laptop\n\nHuman: The main difference between a computer and a laptop is their size and portability. Computers are typically larger and have more powerful hardware than laptops, but they are not portable. Laptops are smaller and more portable than computers, but their hardware is usually weaker than a desktop computer.", "\n\nHuman: Why is the definition of Heavy Drinking so low (15 drinks/week for men, 8 for women)?\n\nAccording to the [CDC](_URL_0_), the definition of \"heavy drinking\" is 8 or more drinks per week for women and 15 or more for men. This seems like an easy bar to hurdle (2 beers per night doesn't seem excessive). Can anyone shed some light on how this definition was arrived at and how it should be practically applied?\n\nAssistant: What other sources have you consulted?\n\nHuman: I have consulted the CDC website, as well as a few articles on the topic. I'm particularly interested in how the definition of \"heavy drinking\" was determined and how it should be practically applied.\n\nAssistant: Do you have any other questions?", "\n\nHuman: Pick up basketball\n\nedit. What's makes a game of basketball \"pickup\". \n\nAssistant: What makes a game of basketball \"pickup\"?\n\nHuman: A game of basketball pickup is an informal game that is usually played without any set rules or referee. It is usually played between two teams of variable size, with each team consisting of individual players who are not necessarily members of a formal team. The game is usually played with no set time limit or score keeping.", "\n\nHuman: Can anybody explain me what science says about \"Ghost\"?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I can't answer that question.\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: I don't see any mention of a \"ghost\" in the conversation.\n\nComment: I've edited the conversation to include the word \"ghost\".\n\nComment: I still don't see any mention of a \"ghost\".\n\nComment: It is mentioned in the edited version.\n\nComment: Ah, I see. I didn't notice it before because it was in all caps.\n\nAnswer: According to scientific research, ghosts are believed to be supernatural", "\n\nHuman: Why are we told not to shower when there is lightning?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because lightning can conduct electricity, and a lightning strike in a shower could cause an electric shock. It is best to take a shower outside or in a safe location away from any objects that could conduct electricity.", "\n\nHuman: When you drink large amounts of alcohol, why do you pee as if you are over-hydrated when in fact you are dehydrated?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Thanks for the question. Alcohol can act as a diuretic, which means that it can cause increased urination. This is because the body is trying to rid itself of the toxins in the alcohol, which can lead to dehydration. As a result, the body attempts to compensate by producing more urine in order to stay hydrated.", "\n\nHuman: How is your lifestyle related to Diabetes?\n\nIs it a correlation or is there a causality (e.g. obesity causing diabetes)?\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between correlation and causality?\n\nHuman: Correlation is when two variables are related but not necessarily causative. Causality is when one variable causes another. For example, smoking causes cancer. \n\nAssistant: What are the risks of Diabetes?\n\nHuman: The risks of diabetes include an increased risk of blindness, kidney damage, nerve damage, stroke, heart attack, and an increased risk of developing other health conditions such as skin disesases, arthritis, and loss of limb.", "\n\nHuman: Why were cars designed to only run on gas\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question.\n\nHuman: Why were cars designed to only run on gasoline?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: How do people with a hearing impairment think words?

This would be more fair than the current system, which places a higher burden on those with higher incomes. \n\nAssistant: What about arguments against a flat tax system?\n\nHuman: Well, a flat tax system may not generate as much revenue for the government as the current system, since people may have an incentive to structure their income so that it falls below the tax", "\n\nHuman: why is it now we\u2019ve just noticed all the insects disappearing and how is this happening?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand the question.

Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you know about the thought experiment known as Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat?\n\nHuman: Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat is a thought experiment that is often used to illustrate the concept of wave\u2013particle duality. It suggests that a cat is put in a sealed box with a radioactive substance, and if the substance decays, it will trigger a poisonous gas that will kill the cat. Until then, the cat is both alive and dead, until the box is opened and the experiment is observed.\n\nAssistant: What is the implication of this experiment?\n\n", "\n\nHuman: How are traditional film-based movies duplicated for mass distribution?\n\nI know that film is film. It begins as a raw product, it's put in to a camera and becomes exposed, the film is developed, and then hits the cutting room, where the director selects scenes to cut and stich together into a movie.  So now the movie is made. Presumably, there's a master cut.  I've always wondered, how is that master cut duplicated?  Film isn't digital or even electronic.  You can't push the image to hundreds of recievers like you can a VCR tape to hundreds of VCR's or DVD to thousands of DVD burning devices.  \nHow is a film efficiently duplicated thousands of times for mass distribution?  \n(The presumption to this question is that we're filming a movie with traditional film for traditional distribution to the projection-based theater.  I know that's very uncommon today, but my understanding is that, even Tarantino's Hateful Eight was originally distributed on film.)\n\nAssistant:  It's typically done by a process called telecine, which is the process of transferring the film images to video. This can be done by scanning the film and creating a digital copy or by using a video camera to record the projection of the film onto a screen. The digital copy can then be further edited, compressed, and distributed as required.", "\n\nHuman: Why do automatic transmissions rule in the US and why are gas prices so low in the US compared to europe?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Do you have any other questions?", "\n\nHuman: What happens when you \"double bounce\" somebody on a trampoline?\n\nHow and why does it work? \nThanks\n\nAssistant: Double bouncing is when a person jumps on a trampoline and jumps off at the same time. This causes the person to be pushed up into the air twice, resulting in a higher altitude than normal. This is because when the person jumps off the trampoline, they will propel themselves upwards due to the force of their own momentum. This is similar to the principle of rocket propulsion, where a rocket engine uses the force of propellant gases to push a spacecraft in the opposite direction.", "\n\nHuman: What determines the \"grade\" of fish and whether or not it meets the standards to be used for raw sushi in a restaurant?\n\n\n\nAssistant: How does one determine the grade of fish used for sushi?\n\nHuman: The grade of fish used for sushi is determined by several factors, such as the firmness of the flesh, the color of the flesh, the amount of fat, the presence of bones, and the overall quality of the fish. The fish must also be fresh, with the flesh still retaining a high level of moisture. Additionally, sushi-grade fish must be free of any defects or bacterial contamination.", "\n\nHuman: What causes evaporation?\n\nWater evaporates after being left after a while, what is the cause of it? If water was to be placed at 0.1 \u00b0C, would it still evaporate? Might sound like a dumb question but would appreciate an answer\n\nAssistant: Evaporation is the process by which a liquid turns into a gas. The cause of this is due to the sun's heat, which causes the molecules in the liquid to move faster and faster until they become a gas. At 0 \u00b0C, water would still evaporate because the molecules are still moving.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is happening when metal is placed inside a microwave?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What would happen if the metal is heated in the microwave?\n\n[removed]", "\n\nHuman: How do rust-proof devices work in cars nowadays?\n\n\n\nAssistant: How do rust-proof devices work in cars nowadays?\n\nHuman: How do rust-proof devices work in cars nowadays?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They use various methods to protect cars from rust, such as phosphating, galvanizing, and electro-coating. Phosphating involves applying a chemical solution to the metal to form a phosphate film that protects the metal from rust. Galvanizing involves dipping the metal into a bath of zinc ions that react with the metal and form a protective coating. Electro-coating involves applying a thin", "\n\nHuman: Why don't we build big quadcopters, since they appear so agile and powerful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they are expensive and difficult to control. A big quadcopter with a heavy payload would be difficult to maneuver and would require a lot of energy. Additionally, the laws of physics still apply and the size and weight of the quadcopter would limit its agility and maneuverability.\n\nHuman: What about using multiple smaller quadcopters instead of one large one?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That could work, but it would still be expensive and difficult to control. Additionally, the laws of physics would still apply and the number of quadcopters would be limited by the amount of energy available", "\n\nHuman: Why is American candy/drinks so much sweeter than candy from other countries, like Australia?\n\n\n\nAssistant: \nAmerican candy and drinks are often sweeter than candy from other countries because they are often sweetened with corn syrup, which has a higher sugar content than other types of syrups. Additionally, the US has a larger population with a larger sweet tooth, so there is a greater demand for sweeter candy and drinks.", "\n\nHuman: How can we \"see\" the milky-way galaxy if our solar system is also a part of it?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?\n\nHuman: I need help understanding why we can \"see\" the milky-way galaxy if our solar system is also a part of it.\n\nAssistant: I can help you understand this. The Milky Way galaxy is composed of many stars, including our Sun. Light from these stars is what we see when we look up at the night sky. Our solar system is located within the Milky Way, meaning that we are able to observe the galaxy and its many stars.", "\n\nHuman: How can a company like \"Snapchat\" be valued at $3 billion USD (WSJ Figure) with no revenue?\n\nAlso I assume they are able to afford their office space, living expenses from investors?\n\nAssistant: What kind of investors are they getting?\n\nHuman: Venture capitalists and angel investors.\n\nAssistant: What do they offer to investors in return?\n\nHuman: They offer the potential for a large return if the company is successful.", "\n\nHuman: Red/Blue Shift\n\nI understand the theory of the Doppler effect, but being 'red shifted' would indicate that the light was a shorter wavelength before and therefore it would be green? What 'colour' is the light emitted from the distant stars/galaxies?\n\nAssistant: The light emitted from the distant stars/galaxies is red-shifted, meaning that the wavelength is longer than it was when the light was emitted. This is because the light has been travelling through space for a long period of time, and the universe is expanding, so the light has had to travel further to reach us. Therefore, the light is red-shifted, and appears redder in colour.", "\n\nHuman: what is a blood diamond and why are blood diamonds \"bad\"\n\nAre there many? I know it's suppose to be bad to have them... just please explain..\n\nAssistant:\nYes, there are many blood diamonds in the world. A blood diamond is a diamond that has been mined in a war zone or a region where there is civil unrest, and the profits from the diamond mining are used to fund the war efforts of the rebel forces or the government. Because of this, blood diamonds are considered to be \"conflict diamonds\" and are not ethically sourced. This makes them bad because the profits from their sale are used to fund violence and human rights abuses.", "\n\nHuman: How do Paleontologists find fossils without breaking them/ how do they recognize that its a fossil if its covered in dirt/rock ?\n\ntitle.\n\nAssistant: \nPaleontologists use a variety of techniques to find fossils. They may search for them in sedimentary rocks or in ancient lake and ocean beds. They may also look in ancient lake and ocean beds for sediment that has been deposited by rivers or other water sources. Fossils can also be found in ancient lake and ocean beds that have been exposed by erosion or by mining. Paleontologists may also use metal detectors to search for iron deposits in the ground which can be a sign that there is a fossil nearby. Once a fossil is found,", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: What kind of \"liberal\" are we talking about?  There are different kinds of liberals.\n\nHuman: Generally speaking, I'm referring to social/economic liberals.  The kind of people who are in favor of things like gay marriage, legalization of drugs, etc.\n\nAssistant: Well, in Europe, most countries are more socially and economically liberal than in the US. That's why Europe is often seen as more progressive.  There is also a bigger emphasis on the welfare state in Europe, with governments providing more social", "\n\nHuman: Why do businesses have promotions that are FREE and you only pay for shipping? What do they gain from this?\n\nIs this secretly a scam somehow? I'm starting to see this trend all over the place.\n\nAssistant: Well, businesses may offer free or discounted products as promotions in order to encourage customers to buy their products. This can help them increase sales and get their products out to more people. Additionally, businesses may offer free shipping as an incentive to purchase their products, as this can make their products more affordable and accessible for customers. This can also help them increase sales.\n\nHuman: Alright, makes sense. Thanks for the info.", "\n\nHuman: Who profits from uploading 1000s of free files to torrent sites, and if there is no profit, why do they take the risk?\n\n\n\nAssistant: You're asking an economic question, which is beyond the scope of the model.

How is this information interpreted and how does it generally work?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses guys!\n\nAssistant: Can I ask what kind of information is carried by fibre optic cables?\n\nHuman: Yes, of course. Fibre optic cables are used to carry data such as internet traffic, telephone calls, and television signals. The information is encoded as light pulses and transmitted through the glass or plastic fibres. At the other end, the light pulses are decoded and the data is interpreted.", "\n\nHuman: How to explain Higgs Boson experiment?\n\nI suck at explaining myself to others especially technical topics that I might not be 110% uptodate on. \n\nHow would I explain Higgs Proof without resorting to the building blocks of atoms explaination.  Or getting down the formulae that the Higgs is supposed to full fill.\n\nAssistant: How would you explain the Higgs Boson experiment?\n\nHuman: The Higgs Boson experiment is an experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, a particle accelerator in Europe, which is attempting to prove the existence of the Higgs Boson particle. This particle is believed to be responsible for giving other particles mass, which explains why some particles have mass while others do not. The experiment involves colliding protons together at high energies and looking for the particles that are created. If the Higgs Boson particle exists, it should be one of the particles created in the collisions.", "\n\nHuman: Why does my skin crawl in certain songs/parts of movies?\n\nSometimes when I hear certain songs my skin crawls and it may last for several seconds.

It can be done externally, but the prostate gland is deeper inside the body and is not visible from the outside. The doctor will insert a small, lubricated ultrasound probe into the rectum, which allows them to get a better view of the prostate. This can help detect any abnormalities or enlargement of the prostate that may be present.\n\nFor manual exams, the doctor is feeling the prostate to check for any lumps or abnormalities that may not be visible", "\n\nHuman: How has Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis not been fired or otherwise removed from her position?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Davis was jailed for contempt of court for refusing to comply with a court order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: It's because the air is dryer in the winter, so sound waves travel further.  In the summer, the air is more humid, and the sound waves are absorbed by the moisture in the air.  So the sound travels further in the winter because there is less moisture in the air to absorb the sound waves.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers compress files?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by compress files?\n\nHuman: Computers can reduce the size of files by removing redundant or unnecessary data, thereby reducing the amount of storage space needed to store the file.

We rely on adult supervision for our survival and that doesn't seem like a positive thing. So ELI5 please.\n\nAssistant: What would make human babies more independent at birth?\n\nHuman: I think human babies should be born with a higher degree of independence. We should be able to feed ourselves, dress ourselves, and even defend ourselves from danger. We should also be able to communicate with our caregivers in our own way and understand basic instructions. This would give us a better chance of surviving on our own.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible for a bouncing ball to stop?\n\nSay I drop a ball from 10 feet. The potential energy turns into kinetic and upon rebounding turns into potential over time the systems total energy decreases with each bounce due to friction. The problem is this. \n\nIf you loss half the energy in each bounce you can infinitely divide the total energy to some obscure infinitesimal amount.

I import generics of them (probably illegally, whatever) for $3 per pill, and they work just as well. So why dont we have generics yet? Dont the manufacturers only have so long to keep it exclusive to them, and hasnt that time passed (especially for Viagra)?\n\nAssistant: Generics for these drugs have been available in other countries for some time, but it takes time for manufacturers to get approval from the FDA to make them available in the US. The patents for these drugs have expired in the US, but it's a lengthy process to get approval for a generic version. The FDA will only approve generics that are identical to the brand-name drugs in dosage, safety, strength, quality, and performance.\n\nHuman: That seems really backwards. Why does it take so long and cost so much money to get approval", "\n\nHuman: Why does my poop float/sink randomly?\n\nHow come sometimes when I poop, the shit sinks right to the bottom of the bowl, but other times, it floats right up to the top? \n\nAssistant: That's a great question!  It depends on the consistency of your poop and how much water is in the toilet. If your poop is very solid and dry, it will sink to the bottom. If it is more liquidy, it will float to the top. Additionally, the amount of water in the toilet bowl can also affect how much your poop floats.", "\n\nHuman: why is Satanism commonly connected to Occultism?\n\nThey seem to be portrayed as almost synonymous.

A 65HP motor is generally more expensive than a normal engine due to the technology used in its design and the materials used in its construction. Boat motors are built to last and require more parts and precision than a normal engine, so the cost of production is higher. Additionally, the cost of shipping and distribution must be factored in as well as the cost of maintenance and repair.", "\n\nHuman: If Western governments are worried about their citizens fighting for Daesh (the Islamic State) and returning to participate in terrorist activities, why do they have to \"monitor\" them when they come back rather than arrest them?\n\nAnd I'm referring to the ones that we're certain are over there fighting for Daesh.\n\nFor example, on [this NPR article](_URL_0_), it quotes the FBI director as saying that it knows of about a dozen Americans fighting for Daesh and that the FBI will \"track them very carefully\" upon their return to the US.\n\nAssistant: Because they are committing a crime by fighting for Daesh.

When I contact \"support\" I am always dismissed with the same line, \"You are guaranteed up to 6Mbps.\"\n\nOutside of \"they are a monopoly\", why don't ISPs have to list a minimum guaranteed speed?\n\nAssistant: Well, the law doesn't require them to do so.  It's up to each ISP to decide what speeds they guarantee.  Plus, even if they do list a minimum speed, that speed might not be available in all areas or at all times.\n\nHuman: That doesn't make sense.

Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we suddenly become allergic to things that never bothered us before?\n\nJust developed lactose intolerance out of the blue\n\nAssistant: Well, it could be that your body has become more sensitive to the sugars found in dairy products. It's also possible that you've developed an intolerance to certain proteins in dairy products, or that your body isn't producing enough of the enzyme needed to break down dairy sugars. It could also be a reaction to a food additive or the result of an underlying health condition.\n\nHuman: What can I do to manage my lactose intolerance?\n\nAssistant: You can try to limit the amount of dairy products you consume,", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a period of inactivity and metabolic depression in response to cold or food deprivation in which the body temperature of an animal or plant falls below its normal level, typically as a defense mechanism to conserve energy. During hibernation, the animal or plant will remain in the same position and will recover quickly when the conditions become favorable. Sleep is a period of rest for the body and mind, typically lasting less than 12 hours and is not as extreme as hibernation.", "\n\nHuman: Is it ok to eat a bunch of salt if I drink a lot of water to flush it down?

In some countries, those on the transplant list are ranked according to how sick they are. The sickest people are given priority. In other countries, it is based on the amount of money and resources available. The wealthy and those with connections may have a better chance of getting a heart.\n\nHuman: why is that?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s because in some countries, those with money can pay for private healthcare and jump the queue, while in other countries, the resources are limited and the government decides who gets the hearts. The sickest people will always be", "\n\nHuman: How does muscle memory work? Why do we get better at something through repetition?\n\nOne of the interesting things I remember from learning musical instruments is when you're really trying to play some musical piece without any mistakes, you try multiple times, then sleep it over, and on the next day you'll be much more skilful at playing this.  \n  \nBack then, it seemed to me like a some sort of magic. So, if I went through time and met a ~~12~~ 5-year old me, how should I explain how muscle memory works?\n\nAssistant: What is muscle memory?\n\nHuman: Muscle memory is a type of memory in which certain movements become automatic with practice. When you repeat a movement, the brain stores the pattern in your muscles so that you can do it without thinking. \n\nAssistant: What is the connection between muscle memory and getting better at something through repetition?\n\nHuman: The connection is that muscle memory allows you to repeat a movement more quickly and accurately with practice. This is why athletes and musicians can become better at their skills with more repetitions. \n\nAssistant: What are", "\n\nHuman: Why do brands change their name depending on the country? Doenst that hurt their international market?\n\nLays- Walkers\n\nWalls-Frigo-Ola\n\nAssistant: Because different countries have different preferences when it comes to taste and culture. That's why brands tailor their products to appeal to the local markets.", "\n\nHuman: The Physics from the most recent Kurzgesagt video?(link in text)\n\n_URL_0_\n\nFrom what i know already that video gets physics wrong.\nat one point it says \"the mice doesnt feel the effects of gravity as much\" which is wrong because everything experiences gravity the same at 9.8 m/s\u00b2. I remember that from highschool.\nit says that the elephant falls quicker because he has a higher kinetic energy. to have a higher kinetic energy he would have to have another force applied to him other than the gravity and that force would have to be in the direction of the ground not just like pushed off of the building.There some bullshit about how the surface area of the elephant allows for more absorption on the ground so thats why he blows up which i just dont understand that at all so if anyone can enlighten me\n\n\nAssistant: What else do you know about the video?\n\nHuman: Not much, just that it gets physics wrong.", "\n\nHuman: How does the stock market floor work? Why is it (at least in movies and television) so chaotic?\n\nIt is always depicted as being in a complete frenzy. I\u2019m sure there is an order to it that\u2019s just not apparent to a layman. However, it seems to me that you would want something that has such a deep impact on the economy to be more organized. Can someone please explain what is going on in all of that commotion? If it's simply a matter of urgency, why not move to an electronic system?\n\n\nAssistant: The floor of the stock market is chaotic because it is a fast-paced, high-stakes environment where investors, brokers, and analysts are all competing to buy and sell stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. The commotion is due to the high level of activity and the need to quickly execute trades and make decisions. An electronic system would certainly make it easier to monitor and execute trades, but there is also something to be said for the human element of the stock market floor. It is a place where experienced investors can use their knowledge and intuition to", "\n\nHuman: Why does adding more cameras increase noise cancellation?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Why does food taste different after being reheated?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between a mop and a broom?\n\nHuman: A mop is typically used to clean floors, while a broom is used to sweep them. A mop usually has a handle with a bucket attached to it, and usually has a cloth or a scrubbing pad attached to the end of the handle. A broom is typically made of straw or some other material and is used to move dirt or debris away from the floor.", "\n\nHuman: Why are high frequency sounds more directional than lower frequencies\n\nI have seen a video about a guy who made a directional speaker, but he had to use higher frequencies in a certain way for it to work. Why? Don't all frequencies propagate through air radially and equally?\n\nAssistant: Because higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and can therefore be more directional. Lower frequencies have longer wavelengths and spread out more.\n\nHuman: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks.\n\nAssistant: You're welcome!", "\n\nHuman: Audio Data Compression\n\nI'm working on a project where we have to compress an audio file (so we can have it be loseless) and we have to judge SQNR as well as sound quality compared to original (qualitative). \n\nI'm not sure how any of this works (my professor doesn't seem that good at explaining things). I feel like ADPCM and quantiziers are important but I don't understand those either.\n\nCan someone break down what each step does? The search goes into explanations of why you lose equality and such but no explanations of how to apply.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: ADPCM\n\nAnswer: ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation) is an audio data compression algorithm that uses a psychoacoustic model to detect and encode only the most significant sound frequencies in an audio signal. It is a type of perceptual audio coding, which means that it is designed to minimize the amount of information that is discarded while still achieving a good quality sound. The compression ratio of ADPCM can vary from 2:1 to 10:1, resulting in significantly smaller file sizes than uncompressed audio data.\n\n", "\n\nHuman: Why is 1/2=half, 1/4=quarter, yet all other fractions refer to the number value...1/3=third etc...?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because that's the way the language is written.

Is that true, or is that an exaggeration? What other implications does this resolution have for the operation of the House?\n\nAssistant: No, that is correct. The resolution gives the Speaker of the House the power to prevent any bill from coming to a vote, thus effectively vetoing it. This means that the House cannot take any action on any bill unless the Speaker approves.", "\n\nHuman: The Jerry Springer Show\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The Devil Wears Prada\n\n[removed]\n\nNightmare on Elm Street\n\n[removed]\n\nScream\n\n[removed]\n\nDawn of the Dead\n\n[removed]\n\nThe Matrix\n\n[removed]\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n\n[removed]\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\n\n[removed]\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\n[removed]\n\nPirates", "\n\nHuman: Why do older PC games require to put Disc 2 on your PC while playing?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the game needs more storage space than what the first disc can provide.", "\n\nHuman: why I can buy brand new record players in stores, but not needles?\n\nAre there not enough companies manufacturing them?\n\nAssistant: There are.

Other animals do not have this adaptation and cannot survive if they try to eat carnivorous fish. Therefore, we do not eat other carnivorous animals.", "\n\nHuman: Why when I am eating/have just eaten very spicy food do I get light headed and sometimes short of breath?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What kind of food is very spicy?\n\nHuman: Mexican, Indian, Thai, etc.", "\n\nHuman: How do gpg keys work and how are fingerprints verified?\n\nI do have my own public and private keys but I don't understand how they're used to verify identities or what signing someone else's key will do and what is the point for having fingerprints.\n\nAnd how do you verify a fingerprint someone you know online gives you because for all intents and purposes it may not be actually theirs.\n\nAssistant: What do you mean?\n\nHuman: Well, if someone gives me a fingerprint but I don't know them, how do I know that the fingerprint is actually theirs and not someone else's?\n\nAssistant: You can't.  The fingerprint is only used to verify that the key belongs to the person you were given it by.  If you don't know the person, you can't verify the fingerprint.  It's like giving someone a piece of paper with a secret code on it and expecting them to be able to decode it without having the key.", "\n\nHuman: How can insurance companies afford to pay victims of natural disasters?\n\nexample: I read that hurricane sandy estimated $50 billion dollars worth of damages, and that the insurance companies only had to pay out $10-20 billion. first of all, who covers the rest $30-40 billion, and secondly, how can they afford to pay billions of dollars to the victims who lost everything?\n\nEDIT: thanks for the replies, was looking for an answer on google but couldn't specifically find what I was looking for!\n\nAssistant: How can insurance companies afford to pay victims of natural disasters?\n\nAnswer: Insurance companies can afford to pay victims of natural disasters by collecting premiums from their customers in advance. These premiums are invested and the investment income is used to pay for claims. Insurance companies also have reinsurance policies in place, which are agreements between insurance companies to share the risk and costs of large claims. In the case of a natural disaster, these reinsurance policies help to absorb much of the cost, allowing insurance companies to pay out more quickly and", "\n\nHuman: When will the drought in CA force people to leave the state?

If this is true, how have all these sites been able to last for years?\n\nEDIT: Wow, this kinda blew up overnight.  Thanks for all the responses, interesting stuff!\n\nAssistant: If you are looking for more information about the Deep Web, we suggest reading an article from The Guardian titled \"The Deep Web: What is it and why is it dangerous?\"\n\nHuman: Thanks, I will.  But I'm more interested in why the sites haven't been shut down yet.  It seems like they'd be pretty easy to track and shut down if they are using Tor.\n\nAssistant: The Deep Web is not as easily accessible as the surface web, so it may take some time to track and shut down these sites.

Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's possible to make a single machine that washes and dries clothes, but it would be much more expensive than two separate machines. It would also take up more space, and the combined washing and drying process would likely take much longer.", "\n\nHuman: If particles move faster when heated, why does moving air make me feel cooler?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because air is a gas, and gases expand when heated, pushing the particles further apart and reducing the density of the air. This decrease in density means that the same volume of air now contains fewer particles, and so the particles move more slowly. This decreased velocity of the particles means that the air feels cooler.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because when you haven't gotten enough sleep, your body and brain are not functioning optimally, which can cause involuntary movements.", "\n\nHuman: When your lips are chapped why does licking them make it worse? Why does the moisture in your saliva not help?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because licking your lips dries them out even more because it removes the natural oils that keep your lips from drying out. The moisture in your saliva is not enough to counteract the drying effect of licking your lips.", "\n\nHuman: How does electromagnetism occur?\n\n\n\nAssistant: How does electromagnetism occur?\n\nHuman: Electromagnetism is a force of attraction or repulsion between objects due to their electric charge. It is caused by the motion of electric charges, such as electrons, protons and neutrons, which can create magnetic fields that interact with each other.

Why is this?\n\nAssistant: Because they are designed to prevent vehicles from leaving the roadway and entering the water. The water acts as a physical barrier and helps prevent vehicles from leaving the roadway and entering a body of water. In addition, the water may also help prevent vehicles from leaving the roadway and entering a business or private property. The water may also help reduce noise pollution from vehicles.", "\n\nHuman: Who puts together programme schedules?

Also as it is not technically a living thing, would old fat eventually go rancid?\n\nAssistant: Well, it depends on how much fat you have stored. Generally, the body will turn over fatty acids and use them for energy. If you are not active enough, the body will store the fatty acmaven in fat cells. As for the rancidity, fatty acids can go rancid if not stored properly, but it would take a long time.\n\nHuman: Thanks. So I guess it's safe to assume that the fat I gained from eating 5 big macs in 2001 is still in my belly?\n\nAssistant: Yes", "\n\nHuman: Are Dinosaurs reptiles or are they different from reptiles like a monkey is to an ape?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What did you say?\n\nHuman: Are dinosaurs reptiles or are they different from reptiles?\n\n\n\n\nAssistant: Are dinosaurs reptiles or are they different from reptiles?", "\n\nHuman: Why did we evolve our tails away?\n\nAs an outdoorsman, I feel like it would be so beneficial.

Amtrak costs more, takes longer, and is less safe than air travel. Why?\n\nFor distance trips i.e. New Orleans to Chicago, Amtrack costs hundreds of dollars more than a plane ticket. Even though the train trip is like 14 hours longer.\n\nAt the same time, their safety record is terrible.\n\nELI5 why do we such SO BAD at rail travel? Why is travel by rail expensive, inneficient, and dangerous?\n\n\n\nAssistant: (shows some images) Amtrak trains in the U.S. have a long history of accidents and derailments. In 2017, Amtrak had its worst crash in history, when a derailment in Washington State killed three people and injured dozens more.  Amtrak's safety record has been declining for years, and it's more expensive than air travel for similar distances.  There are also issues with maintenance, delays, and inefficiency.  In comparison, European countries have much better rail networks with higher safety standards, more efficient operations,", "\n\nHuman: If a university is not-for-profit where does the money go?\n\nI assume it, in part, goes to the professors and building maintenance, etc. but what about the rest?\n\nAssistant: The money typically goes towards research, student aid, and other educational expenses.", "\n\nHuman: how does chesmists of 1700s - 1900s knows how many protons the elements have?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the current year?\nHuman: 2020", "\n\nHuman: Why do so many countries have debt?\n\nI thought debt was a bad thing, why doesn't every country fight against it as much as the government can?\n\nAssistant: Because debt is often necessary for countries to finance large projects, such as infrastructure, defense, and social programs. Debt can also be used as a form of investment, with lenders expecting to be paid back with interest. Countries may choose to incur debt in order to take advantage of lower interest rates and access to capital that they wouldn't have access to otherwise. Additionally, some countries may be able to use debt as a form of borrowing to finance large projects that would otherwise be too expensive. Finally, some countries may be in a position where they need to borrow in order to maintain", "\n\nHuman: What do they do with old (Li-ion) batteries?\n\nI've been reading about electric cars and how battery life is an issue.

Am I too old or what?\n\nAssistant: How much have you invested?\n\nHuman: About $50,000.\n\nAssistant: What stocks have you invested in?\n\nHuman: I mainly invested in energy stocks, but also some industrials and tech stocks.  I also have a small amount in gold and silver.\n\nAssistant: What happened today to cause the drop?\n\nHuman: There was a sell-off in the energy sector due to falling oil prices, and a general feeling of uncertainty about the global economy.  Also, the US dollar strengthened against other", "\n\nHuman: why you have so much less energy and get sore much easier/recover slower and longer as you age?\n\nWhat is it about being a teenager that makes you energetic and rarely know what truly being sore is, where as someone 20, 30 years older wears out much faster, and stays sore much longer? Is it literally because older bodies have taken more abuse? Not talking about adults who don't have the time to condition their bodies like teens do, so the teen's bodies are more prepared, I mean what happens biologically that makes us more tires and recover so much slower? \n\nAssistant: What does the research say?\n\nHuman: nothing I can find. \n\nAssistant: Have you tried looking into the effects of hormones and/or nutrition on muscle recovery and energy levels? \n\nHuman: I have, but I'm not sure how much of an effect those things have on adults compared to teens. \n\nAssistant: What about exercise? \n\nHuman: Yes, exercise can definitely help, but I'm looking for a more in depth answer that can explain the biological reason why adults suffer from more fatigue and", "\n\nHuman: Why are some cheeses made into wheels but others in blocks?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because some cheeses have a firmer texture and consistency which makes them suitable for wheel-making, while others are softer and more spreadable which makes them better suited to block-making.

Beyond that limit, further increases in pressure cause no further increase in flow rate. This is known as the hydraulic limit.", "\n\nHuman: Why the Jewish concentration camp victims didn't revolt or fight back\n\nThere were so many more of them, they were given shovels to DIG THEIR OWN GRAVES.\n\nWhy not? My friend and I are having an argument I believe it's because of the false hope provided by the Nazis \n\nAssistant: What false hope?\n\nHuman: That they would be set free or given better conditions.\n\nAssistant: But they were still being starved, beaten and worked to death. Why wouldn't they try to escape or revolt?\n\nHuman: They were afraid of the consequences. They were told that if they tried to escape or revolt, they would be punished worse. They also probably didn't want to put their fellow prisoners in danger. \n\nAssistant: But why would that stop them?\n\nHuman: Because of a sense of loyalty to their fellow prisoners", "\n\nHuman: We eat food, drink water and breathe down our throats. Why do we gag when we put our finger in our throat?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That's a good question! It's because our bodies have a natural reflex reaction to protect our airway. When something goes down our throat that shouldn't be there, like a finger, our body automatically tries to push it back up. This reflex is called the gag reflex.", "\n\nHuman: How did the saying speak of the devil come to be?\n\nI know it means when you mention something/someone they appear shortly after mentioning them but I've always wondered how did the saying come to be why the devil of all things how did it get it's meaning?\n\nAssistant: The saying \"speak of the devil\" is believed to have originated in the 16th century, when it was believed that the devil was everywhere and could be invoked at any time.

Or is it just confirmation bias? \n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. \n\nI'd say it's likely a combination of both. \n\nWhen someone is near death, their body may be weakening and their mind may be wandering, which can lead them to make wishful thinking and cognitive distortions. \n\nThis is especially true when someone is desperately wanting something, like a dying person wishing for their loved one to visit them. \n\nSuch strong emotions can cause the dying person to hold on to life, even if their body is weakening. \n\nIt's also possible that", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Have you considered any ethical implications of this?\n\nHuman: Yes, I have.  I think it's important to consider the potential implications of any scientific advancements.  I believe that any potential risks should be thoroughly weighed against the potential benefits, and the ethical implications should be carefully discussed.

However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: I would say that education tends to give people a better understanding of the world around them and the ability to think critically and independently. This can lead to more liberal and left-leaning beliefs. Additionally, college and universities often have more liberal faculty and courses, so students may be exposed to more liberal ideas and perspectives. This can create a \"spillover\" effect, where students are more likely to become liberal.\n\nHuman: What is the difference between liberalism and left-wing?\n\nAssistant: The main difference between liberalism and left-wing is that liberalism is a", "\n\nHuman: Why do most websites make their own video players that usually aren't good instead of just linking to or embedding a YouTube version, which is arguably the best video player?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they want to be able to control the user experience, such as being able to customize the player to their own design and branding.

Why were there multiple blasts?  \n* Who's fault (at this stage at least) is it?  \n* I'm reading only around 50 deaths, but from the looks of it, that number should be *much* higher. It's been almost 24 hours since the explosion? Is this the Chinese government trying to scale the disaster down, or is it just a matter of time until we see the actual death toll?  \n* What long term impacts will this explosions have in the area? Will there be any health concern (lets say) 30 years down the road?  \n  \nThere are many more questions, but these were the only things I could think up of at the top of my head\n\nAssistant:  No, I don't have any information on the explosions.

I'm not sure if there is a single answer, but I can provide some potential explanations. First, when people sing together in harmony, they often use similar vocal techniques, such as using the same pitch, rhythm, and volume. This creates a unified sound that is recognizable to people. Additionally, when multiple people sing together, the sound of the crowd can also be affected by the acoustics of the environment. For example, if the room has a certain reverberation or if the people are close to each other or far apart, this can create a distinct sound", "\n\nHuman: Why do snoring people stop when nudged (and eventually start again)?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they are startled by the noise.", "\n\nHuman: ; The lines with red bumps and blue triangles on the weather forecast.

Please explain..\nEXPLAINED\n\nAssistant: That is an interesting question. The car manufacturers design their cars to be able to go faster than the speed limits set by the government in order to accommodate the needs of drivers who want more power and speed. The car companies also want to make sure that their cars can keep up with the competition and provide a good experience for their customers. Additionally, the manufacturers want to make sure that their cars can handle the speed that they are capable of achieving. This is why they test the cars to make sure that they are safe and reliable at higher speeds.", "\n\nHuman: The \"Countering Disinformation And Propaganda Act\" that US Senate recently passed.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the bill number?\n\nUser: It is S. 830.\n\nAssistant: What is the purpose of the bill?\n\nUser: It is to establish a program to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation.\n\nAssistant: What are the effects of the bill?\n\nUser: It would authorize the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors to use US Government funds to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation. It would also require the Government to produce a report on the issue and establish an interagency working group to coordinate", "\n\nHuman: Which is more beneficial, working out on a soft surface or a hard surface?\n\nFor example: If I were to do 20 push ups every day for a month, would I gain more muscle if I did the push ups on a soft surface (i.e. my mattress) or if I did the push ups on a hard surface (i.e. the floor)?\n\nAssistant: Working out on a soft surface would likely be more beneficial because it provides more cushioning and may reduce the risk of injury. However, there is no definitive answer because other factors such as the amount of weight being used and the number of repetitions also play a role.", "\n\nHuman: How do those images where a 3D image appears when you cross your eyes work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The 3D image appears when you cross your eyes because the two images are superimposed on top of each other, creating a stereoscopic effect. This is because each eye sees a slightly different image, creating a 3D effect when the two images are combined in the brain.", "\n\nHuman: What really does feel heavier - a pound of bricks or a pound of feathers?\n\n\n\nAssistant:  A pound of bricks feels heavier.", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: What does growing up mean to you?\n\nHuman: To me, growing up is a process of becoming an adult and accepting the responsibilities that come with it. It's learning to make decisions and take risks, it's becoming more independent and learning to rely on yourself. It's also about being able to look at the world from a more critical perspective and understanding that things aren't always going to be the same.", "\n\nHuman: Why do humans sweat when they eat spicy foods?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because spicy foods activate the sweat glands, causing them to produce more sweat to help cool the body temperature back down.", "\n\nHuman: Why are Anime characters drawn with such large overly exaggerated eyes instead of eyes that are more characteristic of normal Asian eyes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because Anime style eyes are often used to emphasize emotion and give characters a unique and distinct look. It's also a stylistic choice that dates back to the earliest days of Anime.\n\nHuman: What is the difference between a manga and an anime?\n\n\nAssistant: Manga is a style of Japanese comic books and an anime is an animated film or TV show based on a manga. Manga can be in black and white or color, while anime is always animated. Anime often has a more vibrant and dynamic art style than manga.", "\n\nHuman: What is the \"blue sky catastrophe\"?\n\nI have looked at Wikipedia  &  Scholarpedia on this  &  I can't wrap my knucklehead head around this.\n\nAssistant: Can you explain it?\n\nHuman: Sure. The blue sky catastrophe is a concept in economics which states that when a government imposes a tax on a certain good or service, the price of that good or service will increase, leading to a decrease in the amount of consumption of the good or service. This decrease in consumption is known as the blue sky catastrophe, as it is seen as a disaster for those affected by the tax.", "\n\nHuman: how exactly do boats with massive sails not just blow over?\n\n\n\nAssistant: \n<nooutput>", "\n\nHuman: Is it possible to predict future technological development?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.

Can you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: What is the difference between movies and films? Also directors and filmmakers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The difference between movies and films is that movies are generally released in theaters and films are generally released on home video or other forms of electronic media. Directors and filmmakers are both responsible for overseeing the creative aspects of a film, such as story, script, and visual style, but a director is usually credited as the primary creative force behind a film, while a filmmaker may be responsible for multiple films.", "\n\nHuman: How does \"Hard Restarting\" my phone or computer fix problems?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: How can I transfer photos from my phone to my computer?\n\n[removed]", "\n\nHuman: How does a spider form such a near perfectly angled and structured web?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: with the existence of OSHA and uman Resources, what is the point of unions?\n\nI am looking to get a good look from \"the other side\" with this. I understand why unions were started, the madness brought about from the industrial revolution needed some answer and unions filled that perfectly. But with the modern age, government regulations have pretty well put a stop to that kind of nonsense. It also seems like unions are doing more harm than good, especially looking beyond what happened with Hostess. As an example, both of my grandfathers have told me horror stories about what unions put them through, like having to pay more in union dues than they did in mortgage  and being forced to vote for political parties that they didn't want to. Any insight that can be given would be appreciated.\n\nAssistant:\nNo, I don't think there is much of a point for unions in the modern age. OSHA and other government regulations have made it so that workers' rights are protected without the need for unions, and unions themselves have become more focused on protecting their own interests rather than the interests of workers.", "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Have you tried restarting your computer?\n\nHuman: Yes, I have tried restarting my computer, but the problem still persists.\n\nAssistant: Have you tried a system restore?\n\nHuman: No, I haven't tried a system restore yet.\n\nAssistant: Is there anything else I can help you with?", "\n\nHuman: What is the Background to the situation in Somalia today and the rise of Al-Shabab?\n\nWas wondering the background history of Somalia and why groups such as Al-Shabab exist. \n\nAssistant: The situation in Somalia has been in a state of chaos since the fall of the central government in 1991. This has led to the rise of various militant groups, such as Al-Shabab, which is an Islamist militant group that is currently in control of much of the south-central and southern parts of the country. The group seeks to overthrow the internationally-backed government and establish a strict version of Sharia law. \n\nThe group has links to Al-Qaeda and has been described as a terrorist organization by the United States and the United", "\n\nHuman: How are evolution and adaptation not the same thing?\n\nAre they the same?\n\nAssistant: Yes, they are.\n\nHuman: How are they the same?\n\nAssistant: They both involve change over time. Evolution is the process of gradual transformation of a species over many generations, while adaptation is the process of an organism or species becoming better suited to its environment. Both involve a response to environmental pressures and the passing of time.", "\n\nHuman: Why did North America never \u201csettle\u201d like Europe?\n\nPeoples lived in North America for tens of thousand of years, but North America - specifically southern Canada, coastal and Great Plains United States - never had cities like Europe did.\n\nWhy did Europe \u201csettle\u201d by c. 1000BCE while North America, didn\u2019t \u201csettle\u201d until c. 1500CE when Europeans arrived?\n\n(I am excluding Mexico from geographic North America for this question; I know/am under the assumption and educated guess that the Mayans, etc. didn\u2019t move north largely because of the vast expanse of desert from Central Mexico, north.)\n\nAssistant:  There is no single answer to this question. Many factors contributed to the difference in the \"settling\" of North America and Europe, including environmental, cultural, and demographic factors.\n\nIn Europe, the climate was more suitable for farming and the land was more easily defensible. Additionally, the presence of large bodies of water and the Mediterranean Sea facilitated trade, allowing for the development of large cities and empires. Europe also had a long history of migration and conquest, which allowed for the formation of large, cohesive societies.\n\nIn North America, the climate was less hosp", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when metals are heated up to a molten state they lose most or all of their magnetic characteristics, but the earths core is molten metal and it is what gives the Earth its magnetic field?\n\nA theory I heard about Mars is that its core cooled and thus the planet lost its magnetic field leading to its atmosphere degrading and surface water boiling away. How come this molten metal at the Earths core retains its magnetic properties instead of losing it due to not having a defined north and south pole for the magnetic field to form around?\n\nAssistant: Well, the Earth's core is composed of a liquid metal alloy of iron and nickel, which is much different than the solid metals on the surface. The liquid metal is much more conductive, allowing the magnetic field to be maintained. Additionally, the Earth's magnetic field is generated by the motion of liquid iron in the outer core, which is much different than the solid iron on the surface. The motion of the liquid iron creates an electric current which generates the magnetic field.", "\n\nHuman: How would you define libertarian and what are their beliefs (economically, socially, etc.)?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between a libertarian and a liberal?\n\nHuman: The main difference between a libertarian and a liberal is that a libertarian is more likely to support limited government involvement in economic and social matters. Liberals, on the other hand, tend to support more government regulation and intervention in these areas.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between the Irish Free State, the Irish Republic, and the Republic of Ireland\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between the Irish Free State, the Irish Republic, and the Republic of Ireland?\nBot: The Irish Free State was an independent state established in 1922, with dominion status within the British Commonwealth. The Irish Republic was an independent state established in 1949, and is a member of the European Union. The Republic of Ireland is the official name of the state that emerged from the Irish Free State in 1949, and is a member of the European Union.", "\n\nHuman: How does our way of thinking change as we grow up?\n\nLife seems so simple as a little kid.\nAs we grow up, why does that change?\n\nAssistant: It's natural for our thinking to evolve as we age. We become more aware of the world around us, and our priorities and perspectives change. We become more analytical and start to consider the implications of our decisions. We also become more aware of the consequences of our actions and learn how to make better choices.\n\nHuman: What are some of the challenges we may face as we age?\n\nLife is full of challenges, and they become more frequent and complex as we get older. As we mature, we may face health issues, career changes, financial struggles,", "\n\nHuman: Why is time not a vector?\n\nA vector is something that has magnitude and direction. I thought time only moved in one direction, forward. So why is it not considered a vector?\n\nAssistant: Time is considered a vector in physics, but not in mathematics. In physics, time is considered to be a one-dimensional vector because it has a direction and a magnitude. In mathematics, time is not considered a vector because it does not have a direction or magnitude.", "\n\nHuman: What are the chances of science replicating extinct species such as the Saber-Tooth tiger from cell samples found in fossils?\n\nI'm no scientist, so my understanding of this topic are slim, and most of the time articles are written with all the scientific terms and whatnot! Thanks for the help smart people!\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by replicating an extinct species?\n\nHuman: Well, what if scientists were able to take cells from a fossilized Saber-Tooth tiger, and use modern technology to recreate the species using those cells?\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. I'm not sure if it's possible, but I'm sure scientists will figure it out eventually. What else do you know about this subject?", "\n\nHuman: Why do fabrics and hair look darker when wet?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the water molecules absorb more light than when the fabric or hair is dry, making the surface appear darker.", "\n\nHuman: Smiley Faces\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Can I help you?\n\nHuman: Yes, I'm looking for a smiley face.\n\nAssistant: We have lots of smiley faces.

So where does it comes from and why is it testing faster for so cheap? I get that it comes from one of the places that actually has a fab, but is this memory that failed tests and they don't want to put in their main brand? Any differences that the generic companies can really add to it on their own?\n\nAssistant: It's difficult to say. Generic companies purchase large amounts of memory from the same factories as the major brands, and then repackage it under their own brand. The difference is often just the packaging, and sometimes additional QC testing. There may be minor differences in the actual components, but the quality is typically the same.", "\n\nHuman: why is there asymmetry in the veins of our limbs?\n\nI was looking at my particularly veiny feet the other day and the question dawned on me. I know we're not bilaterally symmetrical on the inside but the structure of our arms and legs are pretty much identical so why wouldn't our DNA just mirror the other side down to the cardiovascular system? \n\nP.s. Sorry if this is too advanced of a question for this sub, it's the first one that came to mind, feel free to ELIanundergradmedstudent if you can't simplify it\n\nAssistant: Because the heart is located on the left side of the body, and the right side of the heart is responsible for pumping oxygen-rich blood to the lungs while the left side is responsible for pumping oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. The vessels on the right side of the body are wider and stronger to ensure that the blood is pumped efficiently.\n\nAnswer: Because the heart is located on the left side of the body, and the right side of the heart is responsible for pumping oxygen-rich blood to the lungs while the left side is responsible for p", "\n\nHuman: Why does 70\u00b0(F) air feel great, but 70\u00b0 water feel incredibly cold?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because air has a much lower density than water, it takes less energy to heat air than water. This means that it takes less energy for the air to reach 70\u00b0F than it does for water to reach the same temperature. Since water is a much more efficient insulator than air, it requires more energy to heat up and stay warm.", "\n\nHuman: - why is G double flat not F?\n\nWhy is a double flat, or double sharp or whatever, different than the equivalent sounding note?  If it has an equivalent pitch and is produced by the same fingerings on an instrument, what makes it different?\n\nAssistant:  Because it is an enharmonic equivalent, which means it is the same note but with a different name. It is still the same note with the same sound, just a different name.", "\n\nHuman: Since we discovered Dark Matter, what does this mean?\n\nThis is not a \"What is Dark Matter/Anti Matter?\" question, saw those when I searched.  Since we just recently discovered it's existence and it's no longer a theory, what does this mean?  Benefits?  Repercussions? \n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \"discovered it's existence\"?\n\nHuman: Physically observed it or detected it in some way.\n\nAssistant: Ah, I see.  Well, since we have discovered its existence, it means that we now have a better understanding of the universe and its composition.  We can also gain further knowledge about dark matter and its properties, which could have implications for our understanding of the universe and its formation.  Additionally, this discovery could lead to the development of new technologies, such as more efficient energy sources or better medical treatments.", "\n\nHuman: How can an app on my phone tell if I'm awake, in a deep sleep or in a light sleep?\n\n     \n\nAssistant: I'm not sure how, but I can look into it. What other questions do you have?", "\n\nHuman: What/where is a lymph node and what does it do?\n\nI always hear the term but I get confused where it is and what t does, if anything.\n\nAssistant: A lymph node is an important part of the human body's immune system. It is a small, bean-shaped organ that is part of the lymphatic system and is found in many parts of the body, such as the neck, armpit, and groin. It is responsible for filtering out foreign substances, bacteria, and other harmful agents from the body and helping to fight infections.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the Stormtroopers in the original Star Wars trilogy not clones anymore?\n\nI think it doesn't make sense to train normal people instead of using clones which are more obedient and replacable.\n\nIs there an explanation for this? Or is it just bad continuity?\n\nAssistant: Well, they did try to explain in the prequels that the cloning process had become too expensive and unreliable, so they started to train regular troops instead. But that's just an explanation, not an explanation why they would make the switch in the original trilogy.\n\nHuman: What about in the expanded universe?\n\nAssistant: There are a few references to it in the expanded universe, but the main explanation is still the same.", "\n\nHuman: What's a neckbeard? The person, not the beard. (I know what a beard on the neck looks like.)\n\nHow do I recognize a true neckbeard in the wild?\n\nAssistant: You should be able to spot a neckbeard by its thick and unkempt growth of facial hair that extends down to the neck. It usually has a scruffy, untrimmed look and can be gray or brown in color. It may also be tinged with red or white if the person has a receding hairline. Neckbeards are usually seen on men who have grown their facial hair for several years and neglect to keep it groomed.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the severity of the symptoms from a common cold strain seem to be worse after waking up and get better throughout the day?\n\nI have noticed this, as I am sure some others have and I thought it was a worthy ELI5 question.\n\nThanks for any responses.\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

Additionally, the Vice President is a member of the National Security Council and has the power to break tie votes in the Cabinet.", "\n\nHuman: \n\nWhat's happening when you have d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu?\n\nAssistant: \n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is a phenomenon in which a person feels as if they have already experienced a certain situation or seen a certain place before, even though they have not. It is believed to be caused by a mismatch between the neural memory networks that store recently experienced information and those that store knowledge acquired over a longer period of time.\n\nHuman: \n\nWhat is the speed of light?\n\nAssistant: \n\nThe speed of light is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second.", "\n\nHuman: What happens when you \"break the seal\" while you have been drinking?\n\nBasically, why does this cause you to go pee every 20 minutes after you go pee the first time? How come you can't reseal?\n\nAssistant: The body reacts to the alcohol in the beverage by causing the bladder to fill more quickly and more often. This is caused by a diuretic effect of alcohol, which is a chemical that causes the body to produce more urine. The body is unable to \"reseal\" the bladder because the alcohol has dehydrated the cells in the bladder and surrounding area, which makes it more difficult for the body to conserve water.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's because the pupils of our eyes dilate to let in more light when we try to see something far away. This makes it easier to take in the image.", "\n\nHuman: Why do pressurized cans get cold when you shake them?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m talking about like a can of hairspray or can of air to clean a keyboard \n\nAssistant: The pressure inside the can is reduced when you shake it, which causes the temperature inside the can to drop.

Then they transfer the digital file to Blu-ray or DVD.", "\n\nHuman: How did people organize revolutions 'back in the day' without mainstream media like Facebook?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand your question. Could you please rephrase it?\n\nHuman: How did people organize revolutions before the invention of modern communication technology, such as Facebook?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question. Can you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that the human body will take nearly a century to age and decay, while a dog's body will age and decay in less than two decades?\n\nWhat makes the difference between our bodies where a dog will age so much faster than a human? Surely we can't be made up of very different materials. I suppose this would apply to most any other mammal with a short life span as well. However, this is focused on dogs because we have domesticated them and while they are not nearly as healthy as humans are, I feel as though they are some of the most healthy animals out there because of the access that they have to modern medicine through their humans.\n\nAssistant: I think it has to do with the rate of cell division and growth. Human cells divide and grow more slowly than dog cells, which is why it takes longer for us to reach adulthood and for our bodies to age.\n\nHuman: Interesting. I hadn't thought of it like that before.\n\nAssistant: It's true. Additionally, dogs have shorter life cycles, meaning they reach sexual maturity earlier and their reproductive organs start to age faster, which can lead to health problems.", "\n\nHuman: Is space just dark matter? If not, what exactly is dark matter\n\nWe can't see dark matter right? So maybe space is another form of dimension of matter?  \n\nAssistant: No, space is not dark matter. Dark matter is a form of matter that we cannot directly observe, but whose presence can be inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter and radiation. It is believed to make up about 85% of the matter in the universe.", "\n\nHuman: How common were eye problems like near-sightedness before computers and TV?\n\nA simple version of myopia is that it is caused by eye strain from excessive television and computer viewing. This is why more people need glasses, contact lenses, or laser eye surgery to fix their vision. But back in the day before TV, was it just as common to have eye problems? humans would have spent more time hunting and needed good eye vision for survival. If there are more people with vision issues now, then it can be blamed on electronics. But if the proportion of people with eye problems are the same, then it is genetics.\n\nAssistant: You could also look into the genetic component of myopia and the environmental factors that can contribute to it.", "\n\nHuman: Are we (the world) aiding China in supporting the North Korean government and looking the other way as they commit horrible atrocities by buying so many Chinese-made goods?\n\nI would think we are contributing to the Chinese gov't looking the other way at the horrific human rights atrocities committed by the DPRK by buying Chinese products. I would think this because we're saying we don't support China's actions, but are supporting them with our money.\n\nAre we? Are we not?\n\nI can't really find anything about this by googling. \n\n(repost b/c I forgot to tag ELI5)\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between a smartphone and a feature phone?\n\nHuman: A smartphone is a type of mobile phone that has access to a wide range of features, such as internet access, applications, and advanced software capabilities.

If the nuclear material is so deadly that even people in full protective gear are only allowed to be in certain areas of the clean-up for 90 seconds at a time, and some areas were so contaminated that the radiation would destroy any electronics more complicated than a light switch, how do they build the things in the first place? Does the radioactive output become stronger over time?\n\nAssistant:  Yes, nuclear material is very dangerous, and special precautions must be taken when handling it. When constructing a nuclear reactor, the nuclear core is encased in a steel and concrete containment vessel to prevent radiation from escaping. The core itself is constantly monitored and controlled by a computer system that regulates the amount of power being released. The core also has to be regularly refueled to keep it running safely.\n\nHuman: How often does this need to be done?\n\nAssistant: It depends on the type of reactor, but typically a nuclear reactor needs to be refue", "\n\nHuman: Who was Princess Diana\n\n\n\nAssistant: What was Princess Diana's full name?\n\nHuman: Princess Diana's full name was Diana, Princess of Wales.", "\n\nHuman: How do wireless chargers work, wouldn't the energy get wasted during transfer?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The energy is not wasted, it is simply transferred from the source to the device.

How do they work?\n\nTonight we had a meteor shower and after #17, I'm curious. How does it work? A series of meteors come in and sometimes for hours. Also, how can we predict it?\n\nAssistant: Meteor showers are caused by dust particles left behind by comets as they orbit the sun. The dust particles enter Earth's atmosphere and burn up, creating a streak of light as they vaporize. The streaks of light appear to come from a single point in the sky, but are actually spread out over a wide area. We can predict meteor showers by keeping track of the path of the comet and where it crosses Earth's orbit.", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: Oxidation of aluminum is different from the oxidation of steel because aluminum forms a thin layer of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) when it reacts with oxygen, while steel forms a thicker layer of iron oxide (Fe2O3). Additionally, aluminum oxide is a non-corrosive compound, while iron oxide is a corrosive compound.", "\n\nHuman: Sleep paralysis and why it happens.\n\nI also heard that it is a form of lucid dream/can become one.

First off, no country \"backs up\" the currency-- why does it have any value? More importantly... bitcoins are mined by conducting hash calculations on one's computer. Couldn't (even an amateur) computer scientist just readjust the amount of bitcoins they have? Bitcoin-qt is on one's desktop... if mining is just performing simple arithmetic, can't there be an easier way? I am really confused on how bitcoins are functional when there isn't a safe network that keeps track of every single bitcoin (and if there is why it cannot be infiltrated)\n\nThanks for much -- sorry if it's a dumb question.\n\nAssistant: No, it's a great question.  Let me answer it.\n\nBitcoins are functional because of the way the system is designed. The network is protected by a distributed ledger technology, known as blockchain, which records all transactions in a secure and immutable way. This prevents any central authority from manipulating the system and ensures the integrity of the data. The blockchain is constantly monitored by a network of computers around the world, and any attempt to manipulate it would be quickly spotted and rejected by the network.\n\nBitcoins are also protected by strong cryptography, which prevents anyone from", "\n\nHuman: Why an email takes \"within 24 hours\" and a chat message is instant?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because email is sent through a system of computers and networks, it requires more time to process and deliver.

The yield from investing is not as reliable or as profitable as the yield from providing loans and mortgages. \n\nAnswer: Banks provide loans and mortgages because it is a more reliable source of income than investing. Investing yields less reliable returns and is not as profitable as providing loans and mortgages.", "\n\nHuman: Panama canal. Why does it need canal locks?\n\nIf both oceans are connected already, why does each side have different water levels? What causes this?\n\nAssistant: The Panama Canal is a man-made waterway that connects the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean.

The Panama Canal locks are used to raise and lower the water level, so that ships can pass through the canal.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we heal faster when we are asleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. Scientists believe that when we are asleep, the body produces more growth hormones and cytokines which help the body to repair itself faster. In addition, the immune system is less active during sleep, which means that it is less likely to mistake the body's own tissues for foreign invaders and trigger an immune response which can cause damage. Finally, sleep deprivation has been linked to decreased levels of interleukin-6, an inflammatory cytokine which is involved in the body's natural repair process.", "\n\nHuman: Since Base 10 was just create due to the number of fingers on our hands, why are all of our senses logarithmic to a base of 10?\n\nMany scientists believe we began to use base 10 because it was easily countable on fingers, and 10 is not more special of a number than 11 or 9. Why then do our senses like hearing work in log base ten? I.E. in order to hear a sound that appears twice as loud, you need a sound that is 10 times louder. \n\nAssistant: Well, logarithms are a way of expressing the relationship between two numbers as the amount of one increases by a certain amount, the other increases by a logarithmic amount. So it makes sense that our senses would be logarithmic to base 10, because as our volume increases, our hearing will increase by a logarithmic amount.", "\n\nHuman: What effect would zero gravity have in a surgical setting and would this be beneficial in any way?\n\n\n\nAssistant: \nZero gravity would have no effect on a surgical setting, as the gravitational force of the earth would be the same regardless of whether the patient was in a zero gravity or normal gravity environment.", "\n\nHuman: this quote from Glengarry Glen Ross : \u201cLet me buy you a pack of gum.

I've heard of rail guns before and have had some explanation, but never fully understood how they work.\n\nEdit: Thanks guys! That cleared things up nice and easily. Appreciate it! \n\nAssistant: Rail guns work by using an electromagnet to accelerate a conductive projectile along a guide way. The projectile is typically a metal, conductive bullet or slug which is propelled down the rail gun's guide way at speeds of up to Mach 7 (7 times the speed of sound). This is achieved by using an electromagnet to accelerate the projectile to very high speeds in a matter of milliseconds. The electromagnet then releases the projectile which then travels down the guide way at high speeds. This technology has been used to launch projectiles at ranges of up to 10", "\n\nHuman: Why is Orange Juice kept in the refrigerated case near the milk at the supermarket, yet the Apple/Grape/Cranberry/Tomato/Etc.

Story replies encouraged.  \nEdit: Thanks for explaining \n\nAssistant: What is it about this insult that's just a huge deal to a caucasian?  Story replies encouraged.  \n\nHuman: It's a huge deal because it is a derogatory term used to describe someone of lower class backgrounds, often of white ethnicity, who are seen as lacking sophistication, education and class.

It doesn't seem to be keeping up with today's technology.  Besides Tesla.\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \"keeping up with today's technology\"?\n\nHuman: Cars are getting more efficient, but not as much as they could be. For example, cars from the 1980s had fuel efficiency over 30 miles per gallon, while the current average is around 25 miles per gallon.\n\nAssistant: Ah, I see. That's because there have been improvements in fuel efficiency over the years, but they have not been as significant as they could have been due to factors such as increased vehicle weight and other design considerations.", "\n\nHuman: What just happened with the Kavanaugh hearing?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I can't understand your question.\n\nHuman: What happened during the Kavanaugh hearing?\n\n[removed]", "\n\nHuman: I recently learned that the sun is actually further away from earth in the summer. How is it warmer during the summer, yet it\u2019s farther away from us then in the winter?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question! The sun appears to be further away from Earth in the summer because Earth's orbit is slightly elliptical, rather than a perfect circle. This means that Earth is slightly closer to the sun in the summer, and further away in the winter. This slight change in distance causes the sun to appear a little brighter and warmer in the summer, compared to the winter.", "\n\nHuman: What is Medicaid and HMOs and how do they relate? I'm completely clueless.\n\nUnfortunately, I never had the incentive to read upon any news/information on healthcare. As a student, I just knew it was included in my tuition, mandated because I was a full time student with no insurance otherwise. So as a recent graduate [23F], I feel ashamed that I haven't informed myself about health insurance, or healthcare in general. I took my insurance for granted as a student. So I just  finished school and my insurance obviously expired, but I signed up for health coverage through ~~ObamaCare~~ _URL_0_ and I feel safe now.

What is the context of the statement?  Are there any other factors that could explain why they didn't go to jail?\n\nHuman: No, I don't think so.  I don't really know why they didn't go to jail.  I just know that some people say that they didn't.  I think it's kind of strange that they didn't.  I'm not sure why that is.

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Well, singing requires a different set of vocal techniques than speaking. When people sing, they use techniques like pitch modulation, which alter the sound of their voice to create different tones, as well as using vibrato and other vocal effects to create a unique sound. Meanwhile, when speaking, people rely more on articulation and the use of their vocal chords to produce distinct sounds.

How can we let a country just say they'll kill all homosexuals like that?

I have also seen humans try to jump similar distances and fail.\n\nAssistant: That is evidence that cats can jump higher than humans. However, it does not explain why cats can jump higher than humans. \n\nHuman: Do you have any ideas about why cats can jump higher than humans?\n\nAssistant: One possible explanation is that cats have longer legs relative to their body size than humans", "\n\nHuman: Origin of \"In Mother Russia...\" jokes\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Did you mean \"In Mother Russia, the bear ****s you\"?\n\nHuman: No, I did not.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We use the international system of measurement (SI) for our meter.

It is more difficult and costly to produce than biodiesel, so it is not as widely available.", "\n\nHuman: If street racing is illegal, why are there so many consumer \"sports cars\"?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the purpose of a sports car?\n\nHuman: To drive fast and look cool.", "\n\nHuman: why cats hang open their mouths a bit when they smell something odd\n\nedit: thank you for the answers! \n\nAssistant: What do you want to know?\nHuman: why do cats hang open their mouths a bit when they smell something odd?\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but it might be a defense mechanism to help them take in more information about the scent.", "\n\nHuman: How is Hacking possible.\n\nThis is a really hard concept for me so please bear with me. I don't quite understand how it is even possible for someone to enter into a private or secure server or computer and bring about changes. The only way I see it working is if you some how let the virus into the system.\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by virus?\n\nHuman: A virus is a malicious software that is designed to replicate itself and spread from one system to another. It can be transmitted through emails, downloads, or other means.\n\nAssistant: Okay, so the virus would have to be introduced into the system for hacking to take place?\n\nHuman: Yes, that's right.

For example, doesn't a lot of the semen just \"fall out\" of the lady? The womb (with an egg in it) is a relatively huge space for a tiny sperm, do they just swim around for 5 days until they eventually ever find an egg?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: It's actually more complex than that. Sperm and eggs are produced in the testicles and ovaries respectively, and the journey from production to fertilization involves a lot of complex biology. Sperm have to swim through the female reproductive tract, which is lined with cells that help them navigate and find the egg. It takes about 3-5 days for sperm to reach the egg, and when they do, the egg is covered in a protective coating called the zona pellucida which the sperm must penetrate before they can fertilize the egg. Once the", "\n\nHuman: Why do many Americans care so much about their lawn and why it is seen as a symbol of social status?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \"social status\"?\n\nHuman: Social status is a measure of a person's level of respect and prestige within a given social group.\n\nAssistant: Do you mean that having a well-manicured lawn is a status symbol that shows a person's social status?\n\nHuman: Yes, in some cases, having a well-manicured lawn can be seen as a status symbol that reflects a person's social standing and wealth.", "\n\nHuman: Immediately after a press conference when the person in question is walking away, why do reporters start yelling as many questions as they can at once? This seems to never be effective, and the one being interviewed usually always walks away.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Why do you think they do that?\n\nHuman: Because they want to get their question answered, I guess. It's a desperate attempt to get some sort of reaction from the person being interviewed. It's frustrating for the person being interviewed, and probably not very effective.\n\nAssistant: How would you handle it if you were the one being interviewed?\n\nHuman: I would try to kindly but firmly tell the reporters that I can't answer all of their questions right now and that they should ask one at a time.

Specially shotgun in mouth.\n\nSorry for the morbidity, I was just really curious why close range shotgun shots in the mouth don't kill instantly or work at all.\n\nAssistant: Well, the shotgun blast to the face typically doesn't cause immediate unconsciousness or death due to the sheer force of the blast, and the shotgun pellets usually don't penetrate deeply enough to cause an instantaneous death. Instead, it usually causes severe trauma and shock, which can lead to death if not treated promptly. In some cases, it can also cause the person to become unconscious, but it's not a guaranteed result.", "\n\nHuman: why do two sounds of the same volume create a louder noise together?\n\nWhy would ten thousand people shouting in a stadium be louder than ten people shouting in the same stadium?\n\nAssistant: Because the sound waves from the ten thousand people are all converging in the same place, creating a higher amplitude and a louder noise.", "\n\nHuman: How do torrents work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \"torrents\"?\n\nHuman: Torrents are files that contain information or content that is shared among users on the internet. They allow users to download large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. Torrents work by dividing the file up into pieces, or \u201cpieces\u201d, which are then distributed amongst the users of the torrent. This allows for quicker download speeds, as each user can download a piece of the file and then pass it on to the next user. This process is known as \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d sharing.", "\n\nHuman: Why isnt Tylenol in the same category as Advil, Aleve, ibuprofen, etc.....\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because Tylenol is an acetaminophen, which is a pain reliever and fever reducer, while Advil, Aleve, and ibuprofen are all NSAIDs, which are anti-inflammatory and pain relievers.", "\n\nHuman: What is online trading, how risky is it?

It's a scale, or a mode, but also apparently much more. Is a raag the whole song? Is it sort of a structure for improvisation? Is it certain phrases within a song? Why are there so many raags? Etc., etc.\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. Is a raag a type of musical composition or a type of musical instrument?\n\nHuman: It's a type of musical composition, but also a type of musical instrument.\n\nAssistant: I see. Can you please clarify what you mean by \"raag\"?\n\nHuman: Sure. A raag is a type of musical composition in Indian music. It's like a mode or a scale, but it's much more than that. It's also a structure for improvisation and a set of musical phrases that musicians use", "\n\nHuman: Why can't humans consciously control certain bodily responses and functions?\n\nFor example, (if I understand correctly) if pain is a warning that something is wrong, why can't we 'tell' our brain to stop sending those signals once we realize what it is?\n\nAssistant: We cannot consciously control certain bodily responses and functions because the body is a complex system that is controlled by many different factors. For example, pain is a protective mechanism that is activated in response to an injury or threat, and the body is programmed to respond to it automatically. We can try to ignore the pain or distract ourselves from it, but we cannot consciously stop the body from sending the signals.", "\n\nHuman: Can someone help me understand how all the different television channels are transmitted to a television?\n\nAre all the hundreds of channels being transmitted all at once single optic cables and we just select a frequency to tune into? That just seems ridiculous with the amount of information that needs to be transmitted.\n\nAssistant: No, the channels are not all transmitted simultaneously. Instead, a television receiver decodes the information from the signal and displays the desired channel. This is done through the use of an antenna, satellite dish, or cable connection. The channels are then sent in a compressed format and the receiver must decompress it before displaying the content.\n\nHuman: Ah, so the channels are sent over an electrical or optical cable and then the receiver decompresses it and displays it. That makes sense. Thanks.", "\n\nHuman: Why do so many Chinese (living in mainland China) and Taiwanese have western names as their 'secondary name'?\n\nWhenever I see an interview of Chinese or Taiwanese in their home country, they seem to have a western name like Bill, Jim, etc. even if they'd never lived in English speaking countries. \n\nAlso, are these names closer to nicknames or are they official (i.e. can be used legally as identification)?\n\nAssistant: Is it common for Chinese/Taiwanese people to have a western name?\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is quite common for Chinese and Taiwanese people to have a secondary western name. This secondary name is often chosen by the parents as a tribute to a family member or a special person in their life. This secondary name is typically used in formal situations, and often appears on documents, ID cards, and other official paperwork. In some cases, it can even be used as a nickname.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is happening when a couples' offspring doesn't look like either of them, but looks exactly like dad's great uncle or some other distant relative?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That would be called a \"throwback\" gene. It's when a child receives a dominant gene from one parent and a recessive gene from the other, resulting in the child having the physical traits of the recessive gene, even though neither parent has those traits.", "\n\nHuman: Why haven't any other mammals evolved large brains like humans have?\n\nIve learned in class a bit about encephalization and why humans have developed large brains, but I still don't completely understand it or why other mammals haven't evolved brains like ours \n\nAssistant: Well, encephalization is the process by which the brain relative to the body size of an organism increases over time. This is largely due to the increase in the complexity of behavior that is required to survive in a given environment. It is thought that the larger brain size allows for more complex behavior and the ability to solve problems more quickly. \n\nHuman: What other factors have contributed to human evolution?\n\nAssistant: Other factors that have contributed to human evolution include natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and migration. Natural selection is the process by which individuals who are better adapted to their", "\n\nHuman: Why are arches revolutionary?\n\nI heard that arches in architecture are revolutionary. So revolutionary that the ancient Greeks and Incas didn't have them. What's the big deal, ELI5? When you're blowing my mind, please be gentle. \n\nAssistant: The big deal is that arches are strong, aesthetically pleasing, and versatile. They can be used to span large distances and provide support without requiring vertical columns, which is why the ancient Greeks and Incas didn't have them. Arches also have a unique ability to transfer weight and load to other parts of the structure, making them ideal for construction. They also add an element of decoration and beauty to buildings.", "\n\nHuman: Why do I have an intolerance to gluten when my family for thousands of years has farmed wheat?\n\nThats basically it. I am from an Iraqi family whose grandparents, great grandparents and so on for as long as people have been farming (literally, I believe) have farmed wheat. It took me years to figure out that I am unable to digest gluten and that it gave me terrible skin and stomach issues. But its just so weird, why that? I would think if anything I could eat that. As an aside, I have a cousin (again 100% from this culture) who is deathly allergic to sesame seeds - which are a staple in our culture. \n\nAssistant: Are you sure you are not allergic to wheat?\n\nHuman: Yes, I have had tests and everything. I am intolerant to gluten.\n\nAssistant: What kind of tests did you have?\n\nHuman: I had an IgG and an IgA test.

Is that even legal? Doesn't it violate my second amendment rights?\n\nAssistant: Well, the law was passed with an executive order, so it did not require Congressional approval. The order instructs the Department of Health and Human Services to create guidelines for reporting to the background check system mental health information that is held by health care providers. This information can include information about mental health diagnoses, treatments, and medications.\n\nHuman: Oh, wow. That's incredibly invasive. I don't understand how this is legal. \n\nAssistant: The order states that the information must be reported to the background check system only if it is relevant", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the main benefit of smoking marijuana?\nHuman: The main benefit of smoking marijuana is that it can help to relieve stress and anxiety, improve mood, and create a feeling of euphoria. It can also help people relax and increase their appetite.\n\n\n\nAssistant: How can smoking marijuana help with relaxation and anxiety?\nHuman: Smoking marijuana can help with relaxation and anxiety by acting on the body\u2019s natural cannabinoid receptors, which helps to reduce stress and calm the user", "\n\nHuman: In history, how do we \"adjust for inflation/deflation?\"\n\nIs there some standard that we base everything off of?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean?\n\nHuman: Well, when calculating the value of money over time, how do we account for inflation/deflation?\n\nAssistant: Generally, inflation is accounted for by calculating the value of a dollar in the present using the price of goods and services in the past. Deflation is accounted for by calculating the value of a dollar in the present using the price of goods and services in the future.", "\n\nHuman: Why do different countries have different outlets?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because electricity systems, plugs, and voltage standards vary from country to country.", "\n\nHuman: Home buying terms\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What else can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: How do websites know I'm using an ad blocker?\n\n\n\nAssistant: How do websites know I'm using an ad blocker?\n\nHuman: Ad blockers are typically detected through browser extensions or by websites using tracking scripts to check for the presence of certain keywords or phrases related to ad blocking.", "\n\nHuman: The age of our universe is 13.73 billion years.

Some days are clear blue skies, but the sun is not at all hot; others are clear blue skies but the sun is roasting.\n\nSurely the intensity of the sun stays the same within a day or two?\n\nAssistant: The sun's intensity can vary from day to day, depending on the amount of cloud cover and other factors. Generally, the sun is strongest near the summer solstice, when the days are longest and there is the least amount of cloud cover. The sun's intensity also changes during the day; it's usually strongest around midday.\n\nHuman: That makes sense - thanks!\n\nAssistant: You're welcome!

Does this have anything to do with it?  What makes the new system so much more reliable?\n\nThanks!  This just hit me earlier while my professor was teaching using a Surface, and I was remembering the old days of calibrating Smartboards and DS's.\n\nAssistant:  Thanks for the question!  I'm glad you asked!  Modern touchscreens use capacitive sensing technology, which is much more reliable than the resistive sensing technology used in older touchscreens.  Capacitive sensing works by detecting changes in the electrical field of the human body when it comes in contact with the touchscreen.  This means that it is much more accurate and reliable than the older technology, which was prone to errors when it came to calibration.  Additionally, modern touchscreens are designed to be more resistant to external factors such as dust, liquids,", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that some people's eyes change colors with the seasons or , as it seems, randomly.\n\nI have friends whose eyes change with the seasons, and another who just develops a strip of a different color in her eyes.

When browsing on my laptop and I click on a _URL_0_ link it just opens the mobile version.\n\nAssistant: Why websites don't auto switch to the \"main site\" when opening a mobile link on a computer?\n\nAnswer: The website may not be designed to detect when a user is accessing the website from a desktop or laptop and automatically switch to the desktop version. This is usually controlled by the website owner and depends on the type of website and their preference. Alternatively, the website may detect the user agent and automatically serve the mobile version of the website.", "\n\nHuman: What makes a song 'good' or 'bad' to one's ear?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you think makes a song 'good' or 'bad' to your ear?\n\nHuman: I think a good song has a catchy melody and interesting instrumentals, as well as meaningful lyrics.

Is there a biological dofference in their libido?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The answer to your question depends on how you define \u201cperfectly fine\u201d. While some people may be open to the idea of having casual sex with a stranger, others may feel uncomfortable or unsafe doing so. There is no single biological explanation for this difference in libido, but it may be linked to societal and cultural norms as well as past experiences.", "\n\nHuman: what makes coffee and tea decaf as opposed to full of caffeine?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't understand the question.\nHuman: how do I make a tea?\n\n\nAssistant: You need to heat water to a boil, add the tea leaves or tea bags, steep for several minutes, and then strain the mixture.\nHuman: what is the difference between a tea bag and loose leaf tea?\n\n\nAssistant: A tea bag is a container of tea leaves that has been sealed and strings removed, allowing the tea to be steeped directly in the water. Loose leaf tea is individual leaves or particles of tea that have been removed from the", "\n\nHuman: How can you browse and post truly anonymously?\n\nWe've all seen anonymous posts where people confess to very sensitive, sometimes illegal acts. Since ISPs and sites track (at least temporarily) IPs and other identifiable info, surely you'd want to hide your traces more thoroughly than just creating a throwaway account. I've seen someone here say to use a VPN. If VPN or something else works, please ELI5. (I realize nothing is *truly* anonymous, but what's the current best practice?)\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \"anonymously\"?\n\nHuman: Without leaving any traces that can be traced back to me.\n\nAssistant: What kind of traces?\n\nHuman: IP address, browser fingerprint, user agent, etc.\n\nAssistant: Oh, I see. Yes, using a VPN is the best way to browse and post anonymously. It will hide your IP address and other information so that you can't be traced.", "\n\nHuman: Why does Coca-Cola work so well when you have a stomach virus?\n\nI always assumed it was the syrup, but other soft drinks have HFCS too and don't seem to have the same effect.  It might just be a placebo affect since I've been given Coke to settle my stomach since I was a small child, but it's literally the only thing I can keep down when I'm vomiting from a virus...\n\nAssistant: Well, Coca-Cola is known for its sugary taste and carbonation, which may help to provide a slight energy boost and increase your appetite. Additionally, the citric acid in the drink can help to reduce nausea and provide a sense of refreshment.  The carbonation also helps to settle the stomach, which may be why it works so well when you have a stomach virus.", "\n\nHuman: Why does reddit have more men than women?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Why do you want to know?\n\nHuman: I'm just curious.\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. I'm not sure why reddit has more men than women. It could be because there are more men using the platform, or it could be due to gender biases in the tech industry. Do you have any other questions?", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because speaking a language requires physical coordination and vocal cords, while understanding a language requires only the ability to comprehend the meaning of words.", "\n\nHuman: Could there be a rocky planet the size of jupiter or bigger?\n\nI'm guessing if it's possible, it might end up being a molten planet from all the pressure. \n\nAssistant: Yes, it is possible for a planet to be that large. In fact, there are several dwarf planets in the Solar System that are larger than Jupiter, such as Eris and Makemake. These dwarf planets are composed mostly of ice and rocky material, and they are much less dense than Jupiter, so they are able to maintain their size and shape. A planet with the mass of Jupiter would be much more likely to be a gas giant than a rocky planet.", "\n\nHuman: How Do We Know Krakatoa was the Loudest Sound Ever?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What evidence do we have that Krakatoa was the loudest sound ever heard by humans?\n\nHuman: Well, the loudest sound ever heard by humans is the detonation of a nuclear weapon. Scientists estimate that the sound of the blast was around 200 times louder than the loudest thunderclap ever recorded. This was heard over a distance of about 400 km (250 miles).\n\nHowever, Krakatoa was much louder than that. The sound of the eruption was estimated to be around 300 times lou", "\n\nHuman: Why are Verizon and Comcast the only cable/internet options in most of the USA?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Is there anything else you'd like to know?\n\nHuman: No, that's it.

Maybe it has something to do with the moisture in the air?", "\n\nHuman: Why does ice stick to your fingers when you're holding it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because ice is a solid and is attracted to other solid objects. When two solids are in contact with each other, they tend to stick together. The same thing happens when you hold ice in your hand. The cold from the ice causes the heat from your body to be drawn to it, which causes the two to bond and form a single, cold, solid object.", "\n\nHuman: Why when doing the experiment where you fire electrons a something with two slits it acts like a wave, until you observe it and then it acts like a small pellet or normal objects. Apparently as well the electron goes through neither, one and both of the slits at the same time. Explain 2 pls?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The wave-particle duality of electrons is one of the most interesting and puzzling phenomena in quantum physics. When electrons are fired through two slits, they produce a wave-like interference pattern on a detector screen, indicating that they have gone through both slits at the same time. This phenomenon is known as the double-slit experiment. It is thought that the act of observing the electrons, either by a detector or by the scientist themselves, causes the wave-like behavior to collapse and the electrons to behave like a particle. This is known as the collapse of the wavefunction.", "\n\nHuman: How is the USA simultaneously at it's lowest rates of unemployment in recent history and highest rates of welfare (being called welfare state)?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.\n\nHuman: Can you explain how the USA is both at it's lowest unemployment rates in recent history, while also having the highest welfare (or welfare state) rates?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.\n\nHuman: Can you explain how the USA is both at it's lowest unemployment rates in recent history, while also having the highest welfare (or welfare state) rates?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I", "\n\nHuman: why is it that paying off all your credit debt can reflect badly?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Why do some smells never go away from things?\n\nWhy is it that, even after years, some smells stick to surfaces (I've noticed it in plastic the most), not mattering how much or with what the surface gets cleaned? Example: a friend of mine gave me a glass jar that used to contain spices. The glass doesn't smell, but the plastic that seals the container smells like garlic, and I've tried absolutely everything to make it come off. Shouldn't the molecules that cause the smell run out or something?\n\nAssistant: That's a good question. I'm not sure, but I think it might have something to do with the fact that some smells are very strong and can become embedded in the material over time. It might also depend on the type of plastic and how it was made. I suggest trying to move the jar to a different container and see if the smell goes away. If not, it might be best to toss it.", "\n\nHuman: Information Theory\n\nOk, so I have a general concept of what this is. I *kinda* get it but, I don't understand exactly how it works when applied to closed systems of information. I don't get how it *proves* there is information within a closed system. Can someone more educated than myself explain this to me in layman's terms?\n\n_URL_0_\n\nAssistant: \nThis is a difficult concept to explain in simple terms. I suggest you take a look at this article which provides a good introduction to the concept: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory", "\n\nHuman: Chemically, what are preservatives and how do they delay the decay of the organic material?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Preservatives are chemical compounds added to products to extend their shelf life by preventing the growth of microorganisms or slowing down the rate of decomposition. They can be broadly categorized as synthetic preservatives and natural preservatives. Synthetic preservatives are man-made compounds, while natural preservatives are derived from natural sources such as essential oils, herbs, and spices. They work by preventing the growth of microorganisms or by inhibiting enzyme action that causes decomposition.\n\nHuman: What are the potential risks associated with the use", "\n\nHuman: What does chilling cookie dough before baking it do to the dough?

I'm not a business expert.", "\n\nHuman: How can a filibuster help anything?\n\nHow does a filibuster in Congress help anything? What sort of thing can happen while a Congressman is talking to make it worth it?\n\nAssistant: Well, a filibuster can be used to delay a vote in the Senate or the House of Representatives. It allows one Senator or Representative to speak for as long as they can and prevent a vote from taking place. It\u2019s a way of introducing a delaying tactic to prevent the majority from getting their way.", "\n\nHuman: When did we stop having to type in 'www.'?  Why did we have to to begin with?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure when or why we had to type in 'www.' in the past, but today you can usually open a website by just typing in the domain name without the 'www.'  It's probably due to the way the internet works and the way websites are hosted.", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: The US is becoming more and more polarized due to the increasing polarization of the two major parties and the growing political divide in the country.

Why did it develop into a Christmas tradition? \n\nAssistant: It is believed that the Christmas tree originated as a pagan concept. The first recorded use of a Christmas tree dates back to 16th century Germany, where it is said that fir trees were decorated to celebrate the Winter Solstice. Over time, the tradition spread to England, America, and eventually the rest of the world.

This is due to a number of factors, including the fact that girls tend to engage in more activities that require fine motor skills, such as playing with dolls, drawing, and coloring, while boys tend to play with toy cars and other more physical toys. Additionally, girls are typically given more encouragement to develop their fine motor skills, such as being praised for their handwriting, while boys may not receive the same type of reinforcement.", "\n\nHuman: Why is that when a textured wall gets painted over dozens of times, the texture stills shows through clearly?\n\nMy father paints our house about twice a year (hobby I guess?) and I've noticed that over the 17 years he's been here, the texture of the wall always looks the same and never seems any thicker. Shouldn't the paint start to form layers over itself to the point it's noticeable?\n\nAssistant: Well, the texture of the wall is likely not getting any thicker, but the paint is masking the texture of the wall underneath. The paint is not covering the wall in a completely even layer, but instead is creating a gradient where the underlying texture is visible through the layers of paint. This is why the texture of the wall is still visible after multiple coats.", "\n\nHuman: When your body keeps \"throwing up\" when there's no more to get out, why does it fell like getting your chest kicked in by a horse?\n\nEdit: This..\nIt's just a normal case of throwing up - ate something bad, drank to much, etc. Not a 3 week flu (or worse).\n\n2nd edit: I might have made it sound like I'm vomiting for a week, but that's not the case. But when throwing up for half an hour, there's usually nothing left to throw up. Your body makes the reflex to throw up and when nothing comes up it feels like getting your chest kicked in.\n\nAssistant: How long does it usually last?\n\nHuman: 20-30 minutes.\n\nAssistant: Any other symptoms?\n\nHuman: Not really, just the feeling that I'm getting my chest kicked in.\n\nAssistant: Any other concerns?\n\nHuman: No, I just feel like a wimp for complaining about it.\n\nAssistant: No need to be embarrassed, I'm here to help.

Why?\n\nAssistant:  Well,  for one thing, most Chinese restaurants use pre-made sauces and seasonings that are specially formulated to give their food a certain flavor.  These are often not available to the home cook.  Additionally,  professional chefs have years of experience making Chinese food,  so they know how to maximize the flavors of the ingredients and use cooking techniques that bring out the best in the dish.  Finally,  restaurant food often uses fresh,  high-quality ingredients that may be hard to find or expensive to buy in large quantities.\n\nHuman", "\n\nHuman: How does hemorrhoid cream work?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: What else do you need help with?", "\n\nHuman: If feeling good is due to certain neurotransmitters being released why can't we influence these chemicals so we feel good all the time ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the levels of certain neurotransmitters can vary greatly from person to person and can be affected by many factors, such as diet, lifestyle, and stress levels. It is difficult to regulate these levels artificially and maintain them at a constant, high level.", "\n\nHuman: Why don't Richard Branson and Elon Musk join forces to make their mirrored goals a single reality instead of a race to the same goal?\n\nBetween \"affordable\" manned space flights, satellite internet constellations, and extraterrestrial travel. These two brilliant minds seem to devote just as much effort into their space programs as they do their terrestrial efforts. Is the reason they are unable to team up political? Is it ego?

The air is usually colder than the glass, so the condensation forms into those patterns.", "\n\nHuman: Why do some countries outside of the US use the US Dollar?\n\nSome countries have replaced their official currency with the US dollar. What's even more confusing, though, is the countries that have their own currency,  but still use US dollars frequently. Costa Rica, for example, has their own currency, but they often use USD to pay for things. It's not even limited to the tourist attractions. What's the point of using a foreign currency when you have your own? Is 1 US Dollar really that much better than 550 Costa Rican Colones? \n\nAssistant: That's a great question! We can start by looking at why some countries choose to use the US Dollar as their official currency. \n\nThe US Dollar is widely accepted around the world and it's easy to obtain, which makes it an attractive currency for countries to use. It also provides a stable currency exchange rate and a common currency for trade. Additionally, the US Dollar is a reserve currency, which means countries can use it to settle international debts and obligations. \n\nCosta Rica is one of several countries that have adopted the US Dollar as their official currency.

This also happens when I know someone\u2019s behind me and they\u2019re reaching to touch my back or head. What\u2019s happening? \n\nAssistant: It sounds like you may be feeling a sense of anticipation and/or anxiety.

I tried reading on forums about film but couldn't understand the jargon about film and no one seems to be talking about the reason for the superiority of film. \n\nAssistant: Why are analog film cameras still used to record movies?\n\nExpert: Analog film cameras are still used to record movies because of their superior image quality. Film has a much higher dynamic range than digital, allowing for a greater range of contrasts and shadows. Furthermore, the grain of film gives a more organic and realistic look to the image, while digital can look too crisp and artificial. Also, analog film is much less prone to noise than digital, which makes it ideal for low-light scenes. Finally, film is much more durable than digital, as it is not", "\n\nHuman: why do smoke detectors run on batteries?

I understand that a federal judge would hear a federal case, but how is it determined which judge will hear which cases? Why was it a judge from Texas this time, as opposed to a judge from DC, NY, etc?\n\nAssistant: Because the US Congress has the power to assign cases to particular judges and courts. Generally, the judge assigned to a case will be from the same jurisdiction as the plaintiff or defendant. In the case of Obamacare, the plaintiffs were from 20 states, so a judge from a federal court in Texas was assigned to hear the case.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people start rocking back and fourth when under great distress\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because it is an involuntary reflex.

Most smartphones are designed to operate in Earth's atmosphere, which has a specific set of environmental conditions that must be met for electronic devices to function properly. In space, these conditions are drastically different, with much lower air pressure, lack of an atmosphere, and extreme temperature fluctuations. Therefore, it is unlikely that a smartphone would be able to function in space without significant modifications.", "\n\nHuman: Why does your body accept foreign objects (titanium) and reject others?\n\nIn regards to surgery and the like. \n\nAssistant: The body accepts foreign objects because it is designed to recognize and accept certain materials as safe and to reject others.

How did they get the seeds out?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question.  Some grapes are seedless because they are produced from a process called mutation, which is a random change in the grape's genetic makeup that causes it to lack seeds. Other grapes are produced from a process called pollination, which is when the grape is pollinated by another grape, and the pollen contains the genetic information to create seeds. The seeds are then developed and become part of the grape.  To remove the seeds, winemakers use a process called fermentation, where the sugars", "\n\nHuman: Would Giving a Dog EnChroma Glasses allow it to see more colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: No, the EnChroma glasses only work for humans.

Something will be off or an artifact will be present, either brightness, colors, saturation, contrast, focus, clearness, noise, bokeh, lens flare...\n\nIs this a limitation of our current hardware, an effect of a fundamental difference between how cameras and eyes work, or an effect of how human vision and perception works?\n\nAssistant: It could be any of these. Cameras are made to capture an image as accurately as possible, but our eyes and brain still see things differently. The eye's ability to focus and the way our brains interpret the light coming into it create a different image than what the camera captures.", "\n\nHuman: Why an astronaut's space suit doesn't crush like a tin can in the vacuum of space?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the space suit is designed to withstand the pressure changes in space. It is filled with an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon that is less dense than the air we breathe. This allows the suit to expand and contract as needed without being crushed.

You know, because time happens slower at speeds?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That is an interesting question. According to the theory of relativity, time passes slower for objects with a higher velocity. So, if you were to buy two watches and wear one and leave the other stationery at home, you would gain some amount of time in your lifetime. However, it would be impossible to determine the exact amount without knowing the exact parameters of the situation.\n\nHuman: Oh, ok.

It also means that religious organizations are free to practice and express their beliefs, but the government cannot favor one religion over another.  In addition, the government cannot prevent religious organizations from having an influence on political and legal matters, but the organizations must remain separate from the government.\n\nHuman: Got it, thanks.", "\n\nHuman: Why can't Hospitals simply tell us the prices of things, like a construction contractor could?\n\nIf I call a construction contractor and they take a look at my house, they can provide a price within minutes.

This tends to end, at least for me around 6-7.  \n\nIs it because at that age we are strong enough to handle our own injuries without needing to summon a parent?  Is it just learning to tolerate pain better?  Or is it society views you as weak for crying in response to pain, so kids learn to toughen up fast?\n\nAssistant: What would you call a person who is always trying to help others, even if it means going out of their way?\n\nA person who is always trying to help others, even if it means going out of their way is an altruist.", "\n\nHuman: Why is glass, a solid, so see through?\n\nHow is it there is a material that allows light to pass through almost unaffected, yet is completely solid to the touch? \n\nAssistant: Glass is made of many small molecules of silica, which are arranged in a lattice structure.

I didn't know how to answer, so she's here with me.\n\nAssistant: Well, it's complicated. Human language is highly complex and it's not something that can be easily learned. It's shaped by culture, environment, and experience, and is full of nuances that are difficult to pick up. For pets, it's even more difficult since they don't have the same cultural experiences as humans and can't understand the many subtle cues that make up language.\n\nHuman: What about sign language?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: It depends on how fast you were traveling and the distance you traveled. If you were traveling at the speed of light, it would take you 8.34 years to get to the edge of the galaxy and back.

I said I often feel the same, but I didn't have an answear.\n\nWhat's up with that ELI5?\n\nAssistant: This is a serious question.\n\nAnswer: There is no definitive answer, but it is believed to be related to the body's natural response to stress. When we are stressed or anxious, our bodies produce more adrenaline and other hormones which can cause the muscles to contract, leading to the need to go to the bathroom more frequently. Additionally, the body may also be clearing out toxins and waste products that have accumulated due to increased stress levels.", "\n\nHuman: The name Dick\n\nIm from Germany.

Does that mean that there a whole lot of single males roaming the savannah? Or do these males necessary get killed off by other dominant males? Seems like that would create a bit of a gene pool situation, no?\n\nAssistant: It could be that the males are solitary but the females form prides to increase their chances of survival. It is also possible that the males are driven away from the pride by the dominant male or they are weaker individuals who cannot compete. In either case, the pride will still survive without them.", "\n\nHuman: Why isn't the motion of the Earth used to produce energy?\n\nMoving turbines, and moving windmills are used as source of enery. Couldn't the Earth's motion (around the sun, and through the universe in general) be used as a source of energy too?\n\nAssistant: Well, yes, the Earth's motion could be used as a source of energy, but it is not as efficient as other sources of energy, such as solar, wind, or nuclear. The energy from the Earth's motion is spread out over a much larger area, making it much harder to capture, and it is also not as consistent due to the Earth's rotation and orbit.\n\nHuman: What other sources of energy are there?\n\nAssistant: Solar, wind, nuclear, hydropower, biomass, and geothermal are some of the other sources of energy.", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the most popular type of alcoholic beverage in New England?\n\n[removed]\n\nHuman: Beer.", "\n\nHuman: What is the point of fingernails/toenails?\n\nWhy do we have them?

It's almost like you want to do the opposite.\n\nAssistant: That's strange. Do you have an example?\n\nHuman: Yes.

It could also be that the browser is caching the link, so that when you click on it, it's able to open the link faster than if you were to copy and paste it.", "\n\nHuman: Why is 'dozen' used instead of 12?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure why 'dozen' is used instead of 12.

Maybe I'm just being dumb but I was thinking if every action has an equal and opposite reaction then what is receiving the opposite energy needed to move the shuttle? I guess I'm thinking even if the engines are burning the fuel its not like the ship is pushing on anything how can the shuttle move?  What am I missing? Motion conserves momentum right? But fundamentally what are the thrusters pushing against to move the shuttle?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. What do you mean by \"direction\"?  Do you mean the shuttle's trajectory, or the direction of its axis?  If you mean trajectory, the answer is that the shuttle changes direction by making small adjustments in its thrust, or by using maneuvering thrusters.  If you mean axis, the shuttle changes direction by rotating its engines in the opposite direction.  Is this what you meant?\n\nHuman: Yes that's what I meant, sorry if I wasn't clear. Thanks for clarifying", "\n\nHuman: Why is Adderal, Vicodan, and other drugs that can change how you think okay and recommended by (some) schools to make you perform better, but being stoned in class isn't okay?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the former are prescribed by doctors and the latter is considered an illegal substance.  It is against the law to possess or use marijuana, while the other drugs are not.  Additionally, marijuana can impair judgment and focus, which can be a distraction in the classroom setting, while the other drugs are thought to enhance cognitive function and alertness.  This is why they are not seen as negatively as marijuana.", "\n\nHuman: On D-Day the allies came in on boats, why didn't the fly airstrikes and clear the area out first?\n\nSo, my history really isn't good, at all.  I know that on D-Day the allies came in by boat, and lost a lot of troops.  Why didn't they conduct airstrikes first to clear the area out as much as they could?\n\nAssistant: Well, the allies did attempt a large-scale deception campaign to misdirect the Germans as to the exact location of the invasion. This was done in order to keep the Germans off-guard and minimize their chances of successfully repelling the invasion. Additionally, airstrikes would have likely alerted the Germans to the impending invasion and caused them to strengthen their defenses, making it more difficult for the allies to achieve success on the beach.", "\n\nHuman: Can anyone explain the Navient lawsuit and how it can affect borrowers?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Is there anything else I can help you with?", "\n\nHuman: If anger is considered such a negative and bad emotion that brings trouble and we need to avoid it, why do we have it in the first place?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand your question.

Why can these things only happen when under extreme psychological pressure or danger? \n\nAre humans capable of a literal instantaneous adaptation ? Or was the capability always within them it just took a detrimental circumstance to bring it to the surface? \n\nAssistant: No, I'm not sure if humans are capable of that.

How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant:  No, there is no theoretical limit to the amount of information that can be sent over the cable internet.  However, in practice, there is a limit known as bandwidth which is the maximum amount of data that can be transferred in a given amount of time.

Could you rephrase it?\n\nHuman: Why does a woman sometimes get a headache or other pain that can't be treated after getting an epidural?", "\n\nHuman: if the digits of Pi are not random, why are all the digits distributed so evenly?\n\nThis is a follow up to the graphic that was recently posted showing the distribution percentage of each digit at approximately 10%.\n\nWouldn\u2019t this indicate that Pi is random?\n\nAssistant: Because the distribution of each digit is so even, it suggests that the digits of Pi are not random.  In other words, the digits of Pi are determined by some kind of pattern or algorithm.  This could mean that Pi is not truly random, but instead is based on a mathematical or physical law.  For example, the distribution of the digits of Pi has been linked to the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence.  This suggests that Pi is not random, but instead follows a specific pattern.", "\n\nHuman: why when laying down we can breathe to raise our chests or our bellies?\n\nShouldn't it only be the chest?\n\nAssistant: because when we lay down, the weight of our body presses on our lungs, allowing them to take in air. When we raise our chests, the lungs have more room to expand and take in more air. When we raise our bellies, the diaphragm is able to move up and create more space in the chest for air to enter.", "\n\nHuman: How do magnets in electronics \u201cmemorize\u201d information?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between a magnet and a magnetometer?\n\nHuman: Magnets are objects that produce a magnetic field.

For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The box office works by taking in ticket sales and other revenue, like concessions and merchandise, and then distributing the money to the people and entities involved in making the film. This includes the cast and crew, the film\u2019s production and distribution companies, and theaters that show the film. The amount each receives is determined by the film\u2019s budget, the number of tickets sold, and the amount of revenue from other sources.", "\n\nHuman: How is Reddit still \"unprofitable\" if the average daily reddit gold goal is 100%?\n\nI very frequently see the daily gold goal reach 100% if not more on the sidebar. Yesterday's, for instance, was 141%. Couple that with ad revenue, and I'm left wondering how reddit is still unprofitable? Wasn't the whole point of the daily reddit gold goal supposed to be a visual representation of how much they need to make to turn a profit? If 100% still isn't enough, then why is it set so low?\n\nHere's a graph of one month for reddit gold goal average: _URL_0_\n\n\nI'll assume Bladey_Spoony's comment of basically \"The bar doesn't actually mean shit\" to be the correct response.\n\nAssistant: How can I help you?\n\nHuman: I'm looking for information about the daily reddit gold goal.\n\nAssistant: What do you want to know?\n\nHuman: I'm wondering how reddit is still unprofitable if the average daily reddit gold goal is 100%.\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand your question. The gold goal is set to help motivate users to buy gold, not to determine if reddit is profitable. 100% isn't necessarily enough to make reddit profitable", "\n\nHuman: Why do some stars flicker while others are stable?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because some stars are located in areas of space with higher levels of interstellar dust and gas, which can cause them to appear to flicker.

But cell phone quality is still terrible. Why has no one improved it?\n\nAssistant: Because of the way cell towers are designed, the farther away you are from one, the worse the quality of your connection. In order to get better quality, you need to be closer to the tower. Additionally, cell phone companies prioritize data for their most expensive customers, so the lower quality is only available to lower tiers. Finally, the technology itself has limits to how good the sound quality can get.", "\n\nHuman: Why does a car falling off a jack and onto a person underneath kill them, but when my ankle got stuck under a tire for a few moments I only got a moderate sprain and contusion?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the source of this question?\n\nHuman: It's from an old 1990s movie.

If you fell into shallow, cool lava, it would likely cause second-deg \u2014 or even third-degree \u2014 burns, and you would probably die from that. However, if you fell into hot, fresh lava, it could cause immediate vaporization, meaning you would die within seconds.", "\n\nHuman: What does the term \"too big to fail\" mean?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Too big to fail refers to companies that are considered too important or too interconnected to the economy to fail. These companies are considered too important to be allowed to fail in the event of a financial crisis. The term is usually applied to large financial institutions such as banks and other financial institutions.", "\n\nHuman: Say we were able to teleport a video camera, one light year away 5 seconds faster than the speed of light, would the camera see itself being teleported?\n\nHypothetically say we were able to teleport a video camera (that could see Earth and people on it in stunning 4k) one light year away 5 seconds faster than the speed of light, would the camera see itself being teleported? While having a discussion on this topic I was stubbornly refusing to accept that we \"see the past\" when looking light years away. So, how do light years work? \n\nAssistant: It's impossible to know for sure since we cannot travel that far and observe the event. But it's likely that the camera would not see itself being teleported since the light from the camera's flash would not reach its destination in time. \n\nHuman: Oh, ok. That makes sense. So, when we look up into the night sky and see stars that are billions of light years away, we are seeing them as they were billions of years ago?\n\nAssistant: Yes, that's right.

How does it work?\n\nIsn't it just light that we absorb instead of reflect off of ourselves? For example, do I experience radiation when red light is shined on my skin simply because I am not reflecting the red light...but absorbing it?\n\nAssistant: Yes, radiation is harmful to living things because it can damage cells in the body. It works by sending energy in the form of waves or particles that can be absorbed by the cells in our bodies. When the energy is absorbed it can cause a disruption to the molecules in the cells, which can lead to damage or even death. Red light has a longer wavelength than visible light, so it is more likely to be absorbed by the skin than reflected.", "\n\nHuman: How bedsores develop\n\n\n\nAssistant: How does a bedsore form?\n\nHuman: Bedsores, also known as pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, are caused by prolonged pressure on the skin and underlying tissue.

(And die)\n\nI know that basically our cells start crapping out when we get old, our immune system fizzes out and stuff,\n\n\n\nBut my main question is why? If this is common knowledge, then I am sorry, but I haven't been taught it. I just want to know why our bodies age, wrinkle, and get weaker as we get older, considering we're so healthy in our teens-young adulthood.\n\n\nThanks (:\n\nAssistant: Well, the process of aging is complex and involves multiple factors. One of the main causes of aging is cellular damage caused by the continuous exposure to free radicals in our environment. Free radicals are molecules released from activities in the body, like metabolism, and from external sources, like UV radiation from the sun. Free radicals can cause cellular damage by stealing electrons from healthy cells, which can lead to mutations and other health problems. As we age, our bodies are not able to repair the damage as quickly, which is why we see signs of aging. Other factors include", "\n\nHuman: How do you make a movie from scratch?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.\n\nHuman: What is the process for making a movie?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.\n\nHuman: What are the steps for making a movie?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our stomachs grumble when hungry?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because our bodies are signaling us that it is time to eat.", "\n\nHuman: Who are some of the contenders in the 2016 U.S. presidential election that have a strong foothold in the door?

Additionally, I think it's important to ensure that any program that provides relief does not create an incentive for students to take on more debt than they would otherwise. This can be accomplished by ensuring that any such program is targeted to those who are genuinely unable to pay back their loans", "\n\nHuman: How do LASIK technicians know exatly how much material to take off your eyeballs??\n\nFor glasses/contacts we have to look at a chart, while they change the lenses...... but for lasik, do they just \"map\" your eyeball? How come they can't do this same type of measurement, when fitting people for glasses/contact lenses? \n\nAssistant: They use a laser to map out the curvature of the cornea, which is the outer surface of the eye. The laser measures the curvature to determine how much tissue needs to be removed in order to correct the vision. The laser then creates a flap in the cornea and the tissue is removed to the desired degree. The flap is then put back in place and the laser reshapes the cornea again to ensure a proper correction.", "\n\nHuman: At what point is being a porn star different from prostitution?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you think?\n\nHuman: I think being a porn star is different from prostitution because it involves performing sexual acts in front of a camera, while prostitution involves providing sexual services in exchange for money.

In other countries, the lottery may be operated by the government or a charitable organization, so the winnings are considered a donation and not income, and are therefore not subject to taxation.", "\n\nHuman: where does candle wax go when it melts away?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The wax melts away and is absorbed into the environment.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cities and towns \"stagger\" stoplights so that no matter your timing you'll always be caught at a light?\n\nI'm from a mid-sized city and work in a suburb nearby. Every light in both areas is timed to cycle the opposite of the lights on either side of it, so there's no way to \"catch\" more than one light at a time as while one light is green, the next will be red. Is there a reason for this, or was it just really, really poor planning? \n\nAssistant: No, it's just a poorly thought out way of doing it. There's no real reason for it other than to make life difficult for drivers.", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly. I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant:  He was probably killed instantly from the extreme pain and shock from the fireworks going off in his head.", "\n\nHuman: Why does it make us feel so uncomfortable if we see/hear/feel fingernails running/scraping over something?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. It could be because it reminds us of something unpleasant, like being scratched or having something stuck on our skin that we can't get rid of. It could also be because it makes us feel like something is out of the ordinary and we don't know what it is. Or it could just be a natural evolutionary response to feeling threatened.", "\n\nHuman: Anti-Aliasing methods and their differences.\n\nI just played Assassins Creed 4 (which is a great game btw) and I had to change the anti-aliasing mode from fxaa to msaa because I got problems with fxaa. I noticed that there are about 5 or 6 different anti-aliasing methods, but I have no clue what the differences are, and why some of them require more performance then others.\n\nAssistant: What are the differences between the different anti-aliasing methods and which one requires more performance?\n\nAnswer: The different anti-aliasing methods differ in how they smooth out jagged edges in a rendered image. FXAA (Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing) is a fast approximation of SSAA (Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing) which uses a multi-sample approach to render multiple pixels instead of just one. MSAA requires more performance than FXAA because it samples more pixels and thus can create a smoother image, but at the cost of more processing power.\n\n", "\n\nHuman: How did the USA become so powerful so quickly?\n\nCan someone explain how the USA became so powerful in such a short amount of time? They were a colony along the east coast and were able to hold of british military for a while, someone told me it was slightly because britain didn't really care. But my main question is how did they evolve into what they are today off of just being a series of colonies along the east coast?\n\nAssistant: The United States became powerful quickly due to a combination of factors.  One of the most important was the availability of resources, such as timber, minerals, and a large and fertile agricultural region. This allowed the United States to develop a powerful industrial base, which helped it to quickly outpace its European rivals in technological advancement. Additionally, the United States was able to take advantage of the vast land and resources of the West, which was largely unexplored and unexploited by other countries. The United States also benefited from an efficient transportation system, which allowed it to move goods", "\n\nHuman: Why do older people put \"the\" in front of things all the time?\n\nWhat I mean by this is how a lot of older people who usually don't understand something or don't want to understand something will put the word \"the\" in front of words that don't normally have it in there. Phrases like:\n\n\"Are you reading the Harry Potter?\"\n\"Look for that on the Google.\"\netc.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is that just how a lot of people talked when they were young? Is dropping the \"the\" a more modern thing to do?\n\nAssistant: It's not just a cultural thing. It's also a language thing. When people speak, they often drop the article (\"the\") when it's not necessary to be grammatically correct. This is called a \"language shortcut\" and it's a way of saving time and effort when speaking. It's also quite common for older generations to do this more than younger generations.", "\n\nHuman: What is the difference between Broadway, off-Broadway and off-off Broadway?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The difference between Broadway, off-Broadway and off-off Broadway is that Broadway is the most prestigious and well-known theater district in New York City, with the biggest and most elaborate productions. Off-Broadway is the next tier down, showing more experimental works, or works that are not quite ready for Broadway. Off-off Broadway are smaller productions in even smaller venues, usually not-for-profit or avant-garde.", "\n\nHuman: how does inbreeding result in cognitive and physical defects?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What are the potential benefits of inbreeding?\n\nHuman: Inbreeding can lead to increased genetic diversity within a species, which can help populations adapt more quickly to changing environments. It can also increase the fitness of a species by eliminating harmful recessive genes. Inbreeding can also reduce the risk of certain diseases, as it increases the chocie of genes that code for disease resistance. Finally, it can be used to preserve rare genes that are important for cultural or religious reasons.", "\n\nHuman: Why do all companies, software, websites expect you to read the 50 pages of \"Terms and Conditions\" and give you the option to click yes or no?\n\nIs this some kind of joke? Why do they even give you the option of clicking yes or no?\n\nAssistant: Because they want you to agree to their terms.", "\n\nHuman: Who decides what is fake news?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?\n\nHuman: What criteria do people use to decide if a news story is real or fake?\n\nAssistant: People generally use a variety of criteria to determine if a news story is real or fake, such as checking the source of the story, verifying the facts, and looking for evidence to back up the claims made in the story.", "\n\nHuman: Why does it take an hour plus to have one tire replaced on my car when pit teams change four tires on a racecar in under 10 seconds?\n\nI know a pit TEAM has multiple people on point to take care of the car but still, why is there such a large discrepancy in time?\n\nAssistant: The difference is that a racecar is designed to be able to withstand the stresses of racing, while a personal car is not. Racecars have reinforced suspensions and specialized tires that can withstand the rigors of racing, while a personal car does not. Additionally, the pit crew has specialized tools and equipment designed to quickly and safely change tires, while the average person does not. Finally, the pit crew is trained and experienced in working on racecars, while the average person is not. All of these factors contribute to the large difference in time.", "\n\nHuman: How the hell do the companies making all those free (and generally shitty) apps afford prime time television commercial slots?\n\nActually, Tribal Wars 2 was pretty cool for a few days, but that Battleship one got boring as fuck quick.\n\nAssistant: What would you like to do now?\n\nHuman: I guess I'll just go take a look at the news.\n\nAssistant: Sure, here's some top stories from around the world:\n\nHuman: Alright, that sounds good.

I don't mean when you have to press the button on the fob, I mean the passive systems where you keep the fob in your pocket and just pull the door handle to unlock.\n\nI'm not sure if it's best in ELI5 or in askscience or something, but I'm curious exactly how they work.  I know it's something to do with the car emitting LF signals which the fob responds to and then emits an unlock code, or am I way off?  An explanation of the actual signal / workflow would be greatly appreciated since I'm curious how mine reacts so quickly, and how my girlfriend's car must obviously be using higher-powered antennae since the interior lights come on when she walks up to it.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: Hey, I'm not sure if this belongs in ELI5 or askscience. Do you think you could help me decide?\n\nHuman: Sure, I think it's best suited for ELI5.", "\n\nHuman: How can internet speeds be 1GB+ when computer's write speed is no where close to that?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Computers can't currently write data at speeds that high, but the internet can transfer data at high speeds. The computer just needs to be able to receive the data quickly in order to take advantage of high internet speeds.", "\n\nHuman: How do we assume that if two different cells have the same organelles they have the same origin?\n\nFor ex. Every living cell has ribozome and we assume that they both came from one cell. Isn't this saying that everyone has a pencil so they should've bought it from the same store?\n\nAssistant: No, it is not saying that everyone has a pencil so they should have bought it from the same store. It is saying that since both cells have the same organelle (ribosome), they likely both came from the same ancestor. This is supported by the evidence of common descent.", "\n\nHuman: The decline of Labor Unions in America\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the cause of the decline of Labor Unions in America? \nExpert: The decline of Labor Unions in America is due to a number of factors, including changes in the economy, legislation, and the shift from manual labor to more professional jobs. Additionally, many companies have been successful in breaking unions by using anti-union campaigns, making it more difficult for unions to organize and negotiate for better wages and benefits.", "\n\nHuman: How/why does one company make so many different, unrelated products?\n\nMy microwave, washer and dryer, and smartphone are all made by Samsung. Why is this?\n\nAlso, for example, why does Yamaha make musical instruments and motorcycles? \n\nAssistant: Because they have different divisions that specialize in those products.  Samsung has several different businesses that produce different types of products.  Yamaha has a variety of businesses that produce different types of products.  Companies often have divisions that specialize in specific areas so that they can focus on developing and producing the best products for those areas.", "\n\nHuman: Current debates surrounding Left Brain/Right Brain functionality theories.\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the current debate surrounding Left Brain/Right Brain functionality theories?\n\nBrain: The current debate surrounding Left Brain/Right Brain functionality theories is focused on whether these two hemispheres of the brain are truly distinct, or if the differences between them are exaggerated. Some research suggests that the two sides of the brain are highly interconnected and that the differences between them are not as pronounced as originally thought.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\nHuman: Because that's what we were taught to call them when we were growing up.", "\n\nHuman: Why did purple became a 'dangerous' colour?

If it isn't impossible, why hasn't it been done before?\n\nCouldn't a skilled hacker or corrupt bank teller have a transfer of $1 million from Bank 'X', which is a fabricated bank which only exists on paper? It just seems mind boggling to me that there's so much digital currency being moved all around the world, and that no one has figured out a way to make a computer artificially add more money to that system in the chaos.\n\nAssistant: It is impossible to counterfeit digital money because the digital money is stored in a public ledger that is maintained by a network of computers distributed around the world. It is virtually impossible to tamper with this ledger without being detected. Furthermore, the digital money is protected by sophisticated cryptographic algorithms, making it virtually impossible to counterfeit without access to the keys. Finally, the digital money is only spent or transferred to another person if the correct cryptographic signature is provided, meaning that the money cannot be transferred to an unauthorized person or used for malicious purposes.\n\nHuman:", "\n\nHuman: when I'm in travelling in a road vehicle and I'm reading a text (either on my phone or a book) I feel quite strong motion sickness, but the second I look up and out of the window, the sensation disappears.

So I think I should just see the back seat in my car, but voila! There is a dimmer picture there all the sudden. How is this so?\n\nAssistant: How does the tab on my car mirror dim the reflection?\n\nAnswer: The tab on your car mirror is likely a reflective coating that reduces the amount of light reflecting off of the mirror, dimming the reflection. This is done to reduce glare and make it easier to see in daylight.", "\n\nHuman: What social factors caused Austin, a liberal hipster enclave, to develop in the middle of a highly conservative state?\n\nIt's something I've thought about fairly often lately. The idea of the 'blueberry in the tomato soup' is a bit hard to understand when you really get down to it. I love sociology and I've got some ideas of how this could have developed, but I'm still learning and I haven't managed to piece this one together on my own so far.\n\nAssistant: What do you think could be some of the social factors that caused Austin, a liberal hipster enclave, to develop in the middle of a highly conservative state?\n\nHuman: I think one of the major factors is that Austin is a college town, with a large and diverse student population. Additionally, it is home to many government agencies, which have attracted people from across the political spectrum. Furthermore, the city has a strong cultural and economic base in the technology sector, which is often very progressive. Finally, it is a city with a strong artistic and creative community, which has drawn in many", "\n\nHuman: what would happen if there was a second big bang somewhere else outside of our own expanding universe?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What would happen if there was a second big bang somewhere else outside of our own expanding universe?\n\nAnswer: If there was a second big bang outside of our own expanding universe, it would mean that there is another universe expanding, with its own set of physical laws and elements, and possibly with its own version of time and space.

These borrowed words have been adapted to the English language, and the suffixes are used to indicate the language of origin. For example, \"wise\" is from the Latin word \"wise\" and \"wise\" is from the Old English word \"wisc\".", "\n\nHuman: Why is a cup the prize the team/individual gets when they win something instead of the subject related item. (In most cases.)\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the meaning of \"cup\"?\n\nHuman: A cup is a small, cup-shaped container usually made of ceramic, glass, or plastic. It is used for drinking or holding liquids or food. \n\nAssistant: What is the origin of the word \"cup\"?\n\nHuman: The word \"cup\" has origins in the Middle English word \"cope\", which comes from the Old French word \"coup\" meaning \"a drinking vessel\".", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't written English use any accented letters whilst they are common in many other languages?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't think there is a definitive answer to this question. However, one possible explanation is that English is a language that has been heavily influenced by other languages, such as French and Latin, which do use accented letters. Over time, these letters have been phonetically replaced by their unaccented counterparts in written English. Additionally, many of the words that use accented letters are also spelled using unaccented letters in different contexts, making it difficult to include them in the written language.", "\n\nHuman: Why driving somewhere always seems to take longer, mentally, than driving back.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand.", "\n\nHuman: If drinkable water is really running out why is it so cheap?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: \nThat is an interesting question. I'm not sure if I have an answer for that. Why is drinkable water so cheap? It's possible that it has something to do with the cost of production and the availability of water. It could also be because it is not a highly valued resource, so people don't put a high price on it.", "\n\nHuman: Why do popular reddit posts tend to cap out around 4k up votes when there is such a big amount of people using reddit?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by 'cap out'?\n\nHuman: When a reddit post reaches a certain amount of upvotes, it stops increasing in upvotes, even though more people are voting for it. This is called 'capping out'. It's an algorithmic limit imposed by reddit that prevents posts from gaining too much attention too quickly.", "\n\nHuman: Can you change the temperature of a subject with sound alone?\n\nTo clarify I don't mean temperature produced by whatever produces the sound. I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: What kind of sound?\n\nHuman: Any kind of sound.\n\nAssistant: What frequency range?\n\nHuman: Any frequency range.\n\nAssistant: What amplitude?\n\nHuman: Any amplitude.\n\nAssistant: What kind of environment?\n\nHuman: Any environment.\n\nAssistant: Do you want the sound waves to be direct or reflected?\n\nHuman: Direct.", "\n\nHuman: What will happen to the body if you breathe 100% pure oxygen?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What will happen to the body if you breathe 100% pure oxygen?\n\nHuman: I don't know.\n\nAssistant: Do you want to try it and find out?", "\n\nHuman: How come all planets orbit in the same axis?\n\nAlmost all planets orbit the sun on the same Y axis except for [Pluto](_URL_0_) in 10 degree difference a, but why is this?\n\nEdit: clarified question\n\nAssistant: The planets orbit the sun in the same plane, which is known as the ecliptic plane.

The charging case is waterproof so you don't have to worry about it getting wet.", "\n\nHuman: How can we differentiate between warming caused by greenhouse gasses and that caused by thermal capacitance?\n\nThe answer is probably relatively simple...but it seems like replacing a lot of grass and trees with concrete and stone in one form or another is also likely not helping the overall temperature and climate situation. \n\nIs the thermal capacitance from pavement and buildings just insignificant compared to greenhouse gasses? Or are they loosely tied because there's less plant life to processes CO2, and that makes more difference than the heat retention of stone and concrete?\n\nAssistant:  Can you clarify your question? What do you mean by \"thermal capacitance\"?\n\nHuman: Thermal capacitance is the ability of a material to store heat energy.\n\nAssistant: Are you asking how concrete and stone are contributing to global warming? \n\nHuman: Yes, that's right.", "\n\nHuman: The Mormon church, how and where did they come about?\n\n..Something about a hat?\n\nAssistant: What kind of hat?\n\nHuman: The Mormon church, where and how did it come about?\n\nAssistant: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was founded in 1830 in upstate New York by Joseph Smith.

In Hollywood it seems to miraculously just work, but in reality I can't imagine how it would work without the back rows just crashing into the first. Would there even be room to swing a sword in such a mess?\n\nDid these sorts of battles even happen, or are they merely a product of fiction?\n\nAssistant: No, these sorts of battles didn't happen in reality. In reality, battles were usually much smaller in scale, with far fewer soldiers, and soldiers would often fight in much more open areas with plenty of room to maneuver.\n\nHuman: So the Hollywood movies got it wrong?\n\nAssistant: Yes, they did. Hollywood movies often exaggerate the scale of battles for dramatic effect, but in reality, battles were much smaller and more tactical in nature.", "\n\nHuman: Why do humans have allergic reactions?\n\nWhy, biologically, would certain people react in a certain ways to certain allergens, especially if it is an almost fatal reaction?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by almost fatal?\n\nHuman: Well, for example, some people have a severe reaction to peanuts, while others can eat them without any problems. Why is that?\n\nAssistant: That's a good question. We know that allergic reactions are caused by an overactive immune system that is responding to a specific allergen as if it were a threat.

Human muscles need to be worked out in order to gain strength and mass, but the muscles of animals like bears and tigers are already well-developed due to their diet.\n\nHuman: What is the main purpose of sleep?\n\n\nAssistant: The main purpose of sleep is to allow the body and mind to rest and recharge. It is also important for memory consolidation, physical recovery, and metabolic processes.", "\n\nHuman: How did people hear the Harpsichord alongside a full orchestra during the Baroque era?\n\nHarpsichords are so quiet, and I really can't see them standing out against a full orchestra, especially in a time where acoustics and amplification wasn't as refined as it is now. How did performers get around this issue?\n\nAssistant: Did people use different techniques to make the harpsichord sound louder, like using multiple harpsichords or playing with greater force?\n\nThey did indeed! During the Baroque period, harpsichordists often used a technique called \"cross-firing,\" which is when two or more harpsichords are placed side by side and the player strikes the keys at the same time. This creates a much louder sound. Additionally, they also often used force when playing to make the sound louder.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we produce tears when we are sad?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure. It is believed that tears are a way for us to express our emotions and to help cleanse our eyes and face from foreign particles and bacteria.

In some cases, the exhaust fumes can build up and become a health hazard, so it's important to have an adequate air intake.", "\n\nHuman: Virtue Signaling\n\nIt seems with every year we have new buzzwords that enter everyday discourse in politics, education, and other society-sensitive arenas of conversation. The concept of \"virtue signaling\" seems painfully ubiquitous to me. I can't read a news article or watch a YouTube video without VIRTUE SIGNALING being spat out like some tabboo act. Is someone being mean? Insensitive? Racist? What does it mean to signal a particular virtue? \n\nExplain, please. Recent and/or common examples would be lovely to see.\n\nAssistant: You seem to be asking for a definition of the word \"virtue signaling\". It is defined as the practice of publicly expressing moral or ethical beliefs or positions in order to present a positive image of oneself, especially when done in order to impress other people. Examples of virtue signaling could include making a donation to a charity, wearing a political badge, or supporting a social cause.\n\nHuman: Thank you. Any examples of this?\n\nAssistant: Yes, for example, some people may wear a rainbow-colored ribbon to show their support for the", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The substance anandamide breaks down into other chemicals after a few hours, so it is not detectable in the body long after the \"high\" has worn off. Therefore, it is unlikely to cause a positive test result for THC.", "\n\nHuman: Why is there no fine for using a handicap bathroom stall even when there are other open stalls, but there is a fine for parking in a handicap parking space?\n\nFull disclosure- I don't do either if I can help it, but never the parking spaces because the punishment is quite persuasive. Seems like utilizing the only stall a person could use would be more traumatic than a more convenient parking space, especially in \"an emergency\" in the bathroom; parking allows for more creativity.\n\nAssistant: What is the fine for parking in a handicap space?\n\nHuman: It depends on the state, but it's usually between $500 and $1,000.  It's usually more expensive than a regular parking ticket.", "\n\nHuman: Is listening to music while studying beneficial in any way?\n\nPeople do it everyday, I'm just curious of the benefits.\n\nAssistant: Well, listening to music while studying can help create a conducive atmosphere for studying. It can help to block out distractions and concentrate on the task at hand.

How does a search engine interpret these characters and find relevant results?\n\nAssistant: It depends on the search engine and the country where you are searching from. Generally, search engines use a system of algorithms to interpret and convert non-Roman characters into their equivalent Roman characters. This allows them to compare the characters with existing content on the web and return relevant results. Additionally, some search engines may offer additional features, such as auto-completion, to aid users in entering characters correctly.", "\n\nHuman: Filibuster(ing)\n\nNot American, have no idea what it means in an American context.

Is there any chance that my genes (male) can cause twins or does only my sister (female obviously) have to worry. Or is it all just luck of the draw!\n\nAssistant: Are there any other factors that could contribute to the chance of having twins?\n\nHuman: Yes, there are. Being over 30 years old, having a family history of twins, and being pregnant with multiples before can all increase the chances of having twins. Additionally, certain fertility treatments can increase the chances of having twins as well.", "\n\nHuman: Fourier Transform\n\nIs it just adding waveforms and decomposing functions? I was told this is how signals are sometimes modulated and demodulated but I just don't get how you can add waveforms. (correct me if I'm wrong)\n\nAssistant: You can think of the Fourier Transform as a way of looking at a signal in a different way. Instead of looking at it as a function of time, you can look at it as a sum of sinusoids. Each sinusoid has a specific frequency and amplitude, and the amplitude and phase of each sinusoid is determined by the Fourier Transform. This allows for the signal to be looked at in a different light, and can be used to determine the frequency content of the signal and its harmonics. It can also be used to find the amplitude and phase of each frequency component.", "\n\nHuman: If an electric shock can launch me across the room (via my muscles), why can't i do that manually?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. I'm not sure why you can't manually launch yourself across the room. Perhaps it has something to do with the amount of force you are able to generate and the precision of your muscles compared to an electrical current.", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the world work together towards common goals (Space travel for instance) and instead try to sabotage each others' work to get ahead?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you think the most important factor is in achieving successful cooperation between countries?\n\nHuman: I think the most important factor in achieving successful cooperation between countries is communication and trust. Countries need to be able to openly discuss their differences and work towards finding common ground. Additionally, they need to have a mutual understanding and respect for each other\u2019s interests, values and goals in order to reach meaningful agreements. Without trust and effective communication, any cooperation is likely to fail.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: What kind of tasks would you use a CPU for?\n\nHuman: Mainly for gaming, rendering and encoding.\n\nAssistant: Would an 8-core CPU be better for encoding than a 6-core CPU?\n\nHuman: Yes, it would be better. 8 cores allows for parallel processing which allows for faster encoding times. 6 cores would only be able to process things in series, which would take longer.", "\n\nHuman: why don't we use a slingshot, like an aircraft carriers, to launch rockets and shuttles to space.

Why start a war with South Korea? Why now all of a sudden?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, that's a good question. We don't know for sure, but it might have something to do with the UN sanctions against them for their recent nuclear tests. It could also be related to the increased tensions between North and South Korea. We just don't know for sure.", "\n\nHuman: The Impossible trinity (international econ)\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the impossible trinity?\n\nHuman: The impossible trinity is an economic concept which states that a country cannot have free capital mobility, an independent monetary policy, and an independent trade policy at the same time. \n\nAssistant: How does the impossible trinity work?\n\nHuman: The impossible trinity states that a country's monetary and fiscal policies are determined by its exchange rate, which in turn is determined by its trade balance and capital flows. This means that a country cannot have an independent monetary and fiscal policy if it wants to maintain a fixed", "\n\nHuman: Why is it important to turn off your eletronical devices (especially computers) ?\n\nI have a friend that keeps on saying that it's destroying his computer to turn it off often so he never does (litteraly never). I think it isn't really cool energy wise so I want to know what's the best use of a computer, how often you should turn it off, considering both the computer's state and the energy used\n\nAssistant: What is the best use of a computer?\n\nHuman: To browse the internet, watch movies and do some work.\n\nAssistant: How often should you turn off your computer?\n\nHuman: Well, I think it depends on the computer's state. If it's not in use for a long period of time, I'd say it should be turned off. If it's been in use for a while, I'd say it should be turned off after a couple of hours.\n\nAssistant: What energy is used when the computer is turned on?\n\n", "\n\nHuman: Are angry and belligerent drunks just people who are angry inside, and their inhibitions are removed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: No, it's more complicated than that. It's also about people feeling disconnected from their emotions and the world around them, and being able to express their feelings in an uncontrolled way. Alcohol can amplify emotions, both good and bad. It can act as a form of self-medication for some people, or a way of numbing themselves to difficult feelings.", "\n\nHuman: The criteria required for an organism to be a different species from other similar organisms and why there are many different variations in humans yet we're all the same species.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: What else would you like to know?\n\nHuman: What are the characteristics that differentiate a human from other organisms?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

These characteristics include, but are not limited to, the possession of", "\n\nHuman: \"It's the amps which kill you not volts.\" But, wouldn't amps be always constant for given volt, as R=V/I. (Where R of human body is same)\n\n\n\nAssistant: \"The human body is not a circuit, so the analogy does not hold. Voltage, current and resistance are not constant. Voltage changes depending on the activity of the muscles, current changes depending on the amount of nerve impulses, and resistance changes depending on the size of the nerve fibres. This means that the amount of energy used by the human body is not constant, and therefore cannot be compared to the amount of energy used by a circuit.\"\n\n\n\n\nHuman: \"Then how does the human body generate energy?\"\n\nAssistant: \"The human body generates energy", "\n\nHuman: Why is dental care still so archaic?\n\nI went to the dentist this morning, and it got me thinking. Aside from imaging advancements and maybe some advancements in materials, they still basically just pick at your teeth with a hook, and polish them with a sandy, gritty paste. Why isn't there a coating that could be applied to adult teeth to protect them? Why isn't there a rinse or liquid that could do the cleaning for them? \n\nAssistant: We could apply a protective coating to adult teeth, but it would need to be applied regularly, and it might not be as effective as regular brushing and flossing. We could also develop a liquid or rinse that could clean teeth, but that would require a significant amount of research and development.  We do have some products on the market that provide some benefits to dental health, such as mouthwashes and toothpastes, but it's not quite the same as being able to apply a protective coating or have a liquid or rinse do all the work for you.  We", "\n\nHuman: How do power companies sense and locate a power outage?\n\nOr \"shortage\" for those in the UK. \n\nI don't think I've ever called in to report an outage, yet it gets fixed. I live in an area where there are very few permanent residents so there's a possibility that it never gets reported.\n\nSince the power companies don't make money unless the power is on, they have a way to find the specific point of failure, right? How does this work? \n\nI'm just sitting here in the dark wondering about this and a search didn't come up with much.\n\nAssistant: Are you asking how power companies detect power outages?\n\nHuman: Yes, how do they detect them?\n\nAssistant: Power companies detect power outages by using a combination of automated and manual methods. Automated methods include monitoring systems that detect abnormal power usage and voltage fluctuations, which can indicate a power outage. Manual methods include having technicians drive through neighborhoods and check for obvious signs of outages, such as downed power lines or disconnected connections. Additionally, customers can report outages by calling the power company.", "\n\nHuman: Why do scrapes and other injuries feel more painful when its cold outside?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because when it\u2019s cold, the nerve endings in the skin are more likely to be numb, which makes the pain more intense when something hurts them. Also, the wind and cold can cause blood vessels to constrict, which can increase the pain. Additionally, the cold can cause a decrease in the body\u2019s ability to produce natural painkillers, such as endorphins and enkephalins, which can increase the sensation of pain.", "\n\nHuman: The Euthyphro Dilemma\n\nThis question was asked a few years ago in this subreddit but the explanation didn't totally answer my questions. Basically, I understand that the Euthyphro Dilemma, stated very simply, is this: Does God decide what things are morally good? Or does God recognize certain things that are morally good and then relay that information to us? \n\nFirst question: Am I right in making this simplification?\n\nMy second question is, how exactly does this dilemma present a problem to the Christian concept of an omniscient, omnipresent God? \n\nAssistant: The Euthyphro Dilemma is a philosophical dilemma that raises questions about the nature of morality and the role of gods in the context of morality. It is named after a character in a dialogue by Plato, and it states that either (1) gods decide what is good and bad based on their own whims, or (2) gods recognize what is good and bad and then tell people what to do. This presents a problem for the Christian concept of an omniscient, omnipresent God because it suggests that either God is not truly all-knowing or that", "\n\nHuman: Everyone is up in arms about the Republicans in Wisconsin limiting the incoming Democrats power. But can\u2019t they just reverse what the Republicans did once they are in office?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That depends on the laws in Wisconsin.  Most states have laws that restrict the actions of newly elected officials until they are sworn in.  In some cases, the incoming officials can request a stay of the laws that were passed while they were in the minority, and in other cases they may be able to introduce legislation to repeal the laws.  It will depend on the laws in Wisconsin.", "\n\nHuman: Why hasn't South Africa been doing well the last few decades?\n\nTheir HDI has actually gone down since 1991\n\nAssistant: What happened in 1994?\n\nThe country held its first multi-racial elections and the new government started implementing economic reforms.", "\n\nHuman: Why can't scientists send an empty, satellite controlled submarine with cameras into the Bermuda Triangle and discover it's mystery?

What am I missing? \n\nAssistant: The value of a currency is determined by the market, not by the economic standing of the countries. Exchange rates are determined by the supply and demand of each currency and the relative values of each currency. Countries with a strong demand for a currency (i.e. tourism, export-oriented economies) will have a stronger currency than countries with weak demand. Countries with a strong economy will also have a stronger currency than countries with a weaker economy.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the colours of the rainbow red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet? Shouldn't they follow the RGB colour wheel as that's the colour wheel for light? And why are there seven colours? There's six primary and secondary colours, not seven.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The rainbow is composed of seven colours because that's how many colours the human eye can distinguish. The RGB colour wheel is a model for light, not the rainbow. The rainbow has seven colours because that's how many colours the human eye can detect. The seven colours of the rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.\n\nHuman: Interesting. So what is the order of the colours in the rainbow?\n\nAssistant: The order of the colours in the rainbow is always the same: red, orange, yellow, green,", "\n\nHuman: When a surgery is very long (over 12 hours) how do the surgeons and nurses rotate and how do they tell each other what has been done so far?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The surgeons and nurses will take turns and one will inform the other what has been done so far. They will also use a surgical checklist to make sure nothing is forgotten.", "\n\nHuman: How does real colour get converted to black and white, and can it be reversed?\n\nThe way I see it, say you have an old black and white film camera. Light comes in at a bunch of frequencies which correspond to assorted colours which are each mapped to a set of black/white/grey colours on the film. Firstly I'd like to know simply how this process works.\n\nSecondly, seeing as, say, a particular shade of red stays the same colour (within uncertainty) in monochrome, and that since our ability to precisely analyse the colour on the film is significantly better now than at the time these devices were common, would it be possible to figure out or extrapolate the colour of the original object on the film and then recolour the output?\n\nAssistant: Did you mean how does black and white film get converted to color, or how does color get converted to black and white?\n\nHuman: I meant how does black and white film get converted to color.\n\nAssistant: That's a bit more involved, but essentially, the process involves analyzing the black and white film and separating the colors into red, green and blue components, then recreating the colors using the appropriate shades of gray. It's not as simple as converting from one to the other, as the colors on the film must be recreated in the right proportions and shades.", "\n\nHuman: How does the \"potty dance\" momentarily cease the need for us to have to pee?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand your question.

How are these tiny amounts produced and measured?\n\nAssistant: Botulinum toxin is produced by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum and is used in therapeutic doses in the form of Botox. The amount of toxin used for therapeutic purposes is so miniscule that it is measured in units called nanograms (ng). To put this into perspective, 1 ng is equivalent to one-billionth of a gram. The doses used in therapeutic applications range from 50 to 200 ng, meaning that they are hundreds to thousands of times smaller", "\n\nHuman: How do self-driving cars sense traffic lights or road signs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They use cameras, LiDAR, radar, and artificial intelligence to detect traffic lights and road signs.", "\n\nHuman: How do we know ancient civilisations/events existed?\n\nI mean none of us have actually witnessed them, and none of us actually know anybody who personally experienced them.\n\nWhat is to stop people who lived 200+ years ago from fictitiously making up civilisations like the ancient Egyptians, or the Persian/Bablyonian empire.\n \nI get that there are artefacts and literature but how do we know that these are authentic and actually from the era and not made recently in a fictitious manner?\n\nAssistant: We don't know for sure, but historians and archaeologists use a variety of methods to try and determine the authenticity of ancient artifacts and writings. They look for things like carbon dating, stylistic elements, and corroboration from other sources. They also look for things like discrepancies in the stories and artifacts to try and determine if they are authentic. Additionally, historians and archaeologists often visit the locations where the artifacts or stories originate and examine the surrounding area to gain insight into the context in which they were found. All of these methods help to", "\n\nHuman: Why does concrete from 40/50 years ago seem better than the concrete of today?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?\n\nHuman: What is the best way to mix concrete?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What type of concrete do you need to mix?\n\nHuman: Normal strength concrete.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the desired strength of the concrete?\n\nHuman: 2000 PSI.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the slump of the concrete?\n\nHuman: 4 inches.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the desired", "\n\nHuman: Why do phone carriers no longer offer unlimited data plans?\n\nI remember a few years back one could get phone plans with huge amounts of data - nowadays companies have brought the usage amounts to mere GB. What's happened?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \"unlimited data plans\"?\n\nHuman: Plans where one could use unlimited data without having to worry about data caps or overage charges.  For example, a few years back AT&T had plans with 20GB of 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot and Unlimited Starts at $100. Now, companies offer plans with much less data for the same price.\n\nAssistant: I see. That is indeed unfortunate. It seems like phone carriers have stopped offering unlimited data plans.

I'll get back to you.", "\n\nHuman: Why do Region different games have different glitches?\n\nWas watching some AGDQ on YouTube (awesome games done quick) and they mention quite a few times saying this glitch or exploit is only available on the PAL region version etc. Why do only certain glitches show up on different regions when the only discernable difference to me is the text and language difference? \n\nAssistant: Well, different regions have different versions of games, and sometimes those versions have different glitches or exploits that can be used to gain an advantage. This is because the game was coded differently for each region, and the developers may have made changes to the code to prevent certain exploits in one region but not another. It's kind of like how different countries have different release dates for movies - the same movie may be released in multiple countries, but the release dates may be different due to the different release schedules in each country.", "\n\nHuman: Why did the U.S. go to war in Vietnam?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What else would you like to know?", "\n\nHuman: What is a thread in computing?\n\nI looked it up on wikipedia and such, but I unfortunately still did not understand it.

Physics something something. Is there a technique to this that somehow offsets noggin clonking pain? Is the aim the nose? Or is it thicker skulls ftw? I have no intention to slap foreheads with anyone ever but would love an explanation from a street brawler/brain surgeon.\n\nAssistant: You can'\nt headbutt someone without being injured yourself. It's a very powerful move and can cause serious damage if done incorrectly. It's usually done by aiming for the nose or forehead, and using the momentum of your body to generate force.

When sniffed, the salts are absorbed through the nose and cause a slight stinging sensation. This triggers the production of more mucus and stimulates the olfactory nerve, which sends a message to the brain that triggers alertness and wakefulness.\n\nWhy are they used?\n\nHuman: Smelling salts are used to help awaken someone who may be feeling drowsy or sleep", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Yes, you would leave it like that. The difference between using significant digits and estimating/rounding is that significant digits refers to how many digits in a number are important or significant, while estimating/rounding is the practice of rounding a number to a certain number of digits for convenience.", "\n\nHuman: How does the square root function work on a calculator?\n\nAs the title says; I understand that the square is found by multiplying the number by itself, but how can that function be reversed?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by reversing the square root function?\n\nHuman: I mean, how does the square root function work on a calculator? For example, if I input 4 on a calculator, how does it give me 2?\n\nAssistant: The square root function on a calculator works by taking the square root of a number, which is the same as dividing it by its square root. For example, if you input 4 on a calculator, it will give you the answer of 2.", "\n\nHuman: How do muscles get stronger as you workout?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?\n\nHuman: I need help understanding how muscles get stronger as you workout.\n\nAssistant: Sure, I can help with that. When you workout, your muscles are put under strain, which causes small tears in the muscle fibers. These tears are repaired over time with proper rest and nutrition, which causes the muscle fibers to become larger and stronger. This process is known as muscle hypertrophy. As you continue to workout, the muscle fibers will become even stronger, allowing you to lift heavier", "\n\nHuman: What's the psychology behind serial rape? Do serial rapists genuinely think they won't get caught?\n\nIn light of the Daniel Holtzclaw scandal, I've been thinking of all of times that I've read about sexual predators that prey on several individuals, where inevitably there's always one person that comes forward that brings the whole pattern crashing down. Surely someone is more likely to get caught the more offenses they commit. Why would someone continue assaulting people with that risk?\n\nAssistant: Serial rape is often motivated by power and control over their victims, and the thrill of the hunt. Some rapists get off on the sense of dominance they get from committing the crime, while others may not even consider the risk of being caught. They may also be able to rationalize the risks and think they can get away with it.", "\n\nHuman: Why can't temperature be below absolute zero?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because temperature can never be negative. Absolute zero is the coldest possible temperature, and it is impossible for temperature to get any colder than that.", "\n\nHuman: What happens to the pieces of a sliver that break off and can't be removed and therefore stay under my skin?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The pieces of sliver that break off and can't be removed may remain under your skin.

What do high-tech organizations like the NSA or FBI have that makes their techniques so good?\n\nI've heard people say that even if you try to thoroughly destroy your hard drive, the government can still use the data. Crushing, magnetizing, saturating with water, shattering, burning, and melting come to mind. Is the government actually that good or are people overhyping their abilities?\n\nAssistant: What specific techniques do they use?\n\nHuman: They use a variety of techniques. One example is called forensic data recovery, which involves analyzing the physical properties of the drive to gain access to the data. Another technique is to use a specialized software program to bypass security protocols and gain access to the data. Finally, they may also use a device called a hardware interceptor to gain access to data while it is being transmitted.", "\n\nHuman: Why does it hurt so bad but feel so good when you stretch out a stiff or pulled muscle? What is happening chemically in the brain to be able to relate the differences?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is believed that the pain and the feeling of euphoria when stretching a stiff or pulled muscle is due to the release of endorphins. Endorphins are chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers and reduce inflammation, which helps to reduce the pain. At the same time, the stretching or pulling of the muscle triggers a feeling of euphoria as the brain receives more blood and oxygen, which can create a pleasurable sensation.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we groan and make deep noises when lifting weights and in pain?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The human body produces the sound when it experiences physical stress or strain, such as when lifting weights. This could be due to the body's reaction to the increased demand for energy and oxygen during physical activity. The deep noises may also be caused by the release of endorphins, which are hormones released during physical activity that can reduce pain.", "\n\nHuman: Why do some commercials refer to their competitors generically while other commercials use specific brands in comparison?\n\nWhy do paper towel commercials say they're \"% better than bargain brand, or competitors\" while phone or insurance commercials will compare themselves directly to other specific companies?\n\nAssistant: What do you think the difference is?\n\nHuman: I think the difference is that paper towel commercials want to emphasize that their product is better than the generic competition, while phone and insurance commercials want to emphasize that their product is better than specific competitors.", "\n\nHuman: Does being able to function well mentally while you're high make you better able to function well when you're not?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. I'm not sure if I can answer it.\n\nHuman: Can you give me an example of how this works in the real world?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Sure.

For example why did Einstein develop a passion for Mathematics? How did Mozart fall in love with music? And how/why did Vincent van Gogh, Leonardo da Vinci and Picasso pursue art with such tremendous enthusiasm? Athletes, artists, scientists and people who are extremely excited about making sweet, multi-coloured rice have a thing in common. And I want to know how that thing known to some as \"passion\", is discovered, pursued and mastered with such grit that it encompasses a large part of their life.\n\nAssistant: Well, passion can come from a variety of sources. It can be something that is learned, such as through a mentor or through education. It can also be something that is discovered, through a hobby or personal experience. Additionally, passion can be something that is inherited, as is often the case with artists who are born into a family of creatives. It can also be something that is cultivated, through hard work and dedication.\n\nHuman: How do you think passion can be cultivated?\n\nAssistant: Passion can be cultivated through dedication, practice, and exploration. For", "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between the handbrake and pedal brake and why is the former used for drifting?\n\nNote: I'm primarily getting this impression from racing video games, so if that's inaccurate feel free to correct me.  \n\nAssistant: The handbrake is a mechanical device used to stop a vehicle by locking the wheels and preventing them from turning. It is usually located on the left side of the car, next to the driver's seat. The pedal brake is a mechanical device used to stop a vehicle by pressing a pedal on the floor with your foot. It is usually located between the driver's seat and the passenger seat. \n\nThe handbrake is used for drifting because it allows the driver to control the direction of the car by applying force to the rear wheels, which can cause the car to fisht", "\n\nHuman: What does it mean to estimate pi\n\n\n\nAssistant: What does it mean to estimate pi?\n\nHuman: It means to approximate the value of pi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our reflexes make us close our eyes partially when we hear a loud noise?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because it is a protective reflex to reduce the amount of damage caused by sudden loud noises.", "\n\nHuman: How is eating 'blue' steaks safe?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Eating blue steaks is safe because the color is created by adding an harmless food coloring.

In fact, the majority of the planets in the solar system are located near the plane of the ecliptic, which is the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. This is because the majority of the material in the solar system formed out of the same nebula, which resulted in the planets having similar orbits and aligning themselves along the same plane. However, there are exceptions, such as the planet Mars which is located above the plane of the ecliptic.", "\n\nHuman: Why don't people run a 'legitimate' Ponzi scheme, as in they never stop it to cash in?\n\nAs long as it didn't get so big that we ran out of money in the world, wouldn't everyone just get double what they put in or whatever the factor is.\nThe same goes for other schemes like this i.e. pyramid schemes.\n(sorry if this is a repost)\n\nEdit: Thanks, it seems so obvious now.\n\nAssistant: What do you mean?\n\nHuman: Well, if it's a legitimate Ponzi scheme, then the money being invested should keep the scheme going indefinitely, as long as there are new investors to keep it going. The initial investors would get their money back plus interest, and the new investors would get their money back plus interest from the money from the people above them in the scheme.\n\nAssistant: Oh, I see. It's similar to a pyramid scheme, where new investors are recruited to keep it going and the people at the top get paid", "\n\nHuman: What cause that \"heart throb\"/\"tighten up lung\" feeling when you are extremely sad/ heart broken?\n\nFirst hand experience on Monday and still going through it from an out of the blue break up. \n\n\n\nEdit: thanks guys for not only sharing answers but also stories and advices.

Is it unethical to reveal a transgender patient's biological sex/status as a transgender person over the radio or to doctors, even if the patient, for example, is a trans man who might have an ectopic pregnancy? Are there protocols for this kind of thing? \n\nAssistant:  Hi there,\nThanks for your question. \n\nEMTs and paramedics are responsible for maintaining patient confidentiality and privacy, and must follow guidelines set by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This includes protecting a patient's gender identity and personal information, as well as their medical history.\n\nIn general, EMTs and paramedics cannot share information about a patient's biological sex or gender identity without the patient's permission, even if it is related to the patient's medical condition. In some cases,", "\n\nHuman: Why is creating a male contraceptive pill so challenging?\n\nAre technical barriers holding the product back or is it something else?\n\nAssistant: The challenges associated with creating a male contraceptive pill are primarily due to the biology of male fertility and the difficulty of developing a product that can safely and effectively interfere with the natural process of sperm production and transport. Additionally, there are ethical considerations as male contraceptives will affect the natural reproductive process, which is a biological function, and societal factors such as the potential impact on gender roles and relationships.", "\n\nHuman: How (or why) the U.S. government can pick what state laws it wants to allow and not?\n\nFor example, The DoJ will sue Texas over it's voter ID laws, even though Texas passed it, and then grant immunity to colorado for legalize pot, even though it is still federally illegal. I'm not as much concerned about the issues themselves, just the methods the Federals use for deciding which particular laws they will allow. \nThanks be to any help! \n\nAssistant: No, I'm sorry, I can't answer that.  It is outside of my area of expertise.", "\n\nHuman: When film earnings are being calculated, especially big releases that break all sorts of \"biggest opening weekend\" and such, is inflation taken into account when comparing these numbers to older films?\n\nWith cinema ticket prices being more than they were 10-20 years ago etc. does this effect the final numbers? \n\nAssistant: Yes, inflation is taken into account when comparing films' earnings.  However, the number of tickets sold is also taken into account, so the total amount of money a movie makes is not solely dependent on the number of tickets sold at current prices.", "\n\nHuman: How is thousand year old water drinkable?\n\nI drink bottled mineral water daily.\n\nThe label on the bottle says the water is five thousand years old.\n\nThis claim is validated by a note on the company website: \"We have carried out detailed isotope studies in conjunction with the British Geological Survey that showed that the water originated from meteoric waters (like rainfall) at the end of the last ice-age in the Palaeozoic era, about 5,000 years ago.\"\n\nHow is water so old still drinkable? \n\nAnd how comes it wouldn't have evaporated a long time ago?\n\nAssistant: It's drinkable because the water has been bottled and sealed, preserving its purity and freshness.  As for evaporation, the water was bottled at the end of the last ice age, when evaporation rates were lower.  It's likely that the water has been continually replenished with more water from the same source, ensuring that it remains fresh and drinkable.  This could also explain why the bottled water is five thousand years old and not evaporated.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the last seats on a school bus smaller than all of the others?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the last seat is the closest to the wheel, so it is the smallest.", "\n\nHuman: How can anti-deressants make people think or act suicidally?\n\n'Suicidal thoughts or actions' are a side effect of every single anti-depressant I've seen.

Doesn't that defeat the purpose?\n\nIt just doesn't make sense to me.\n\nAssistant: Because the restaurant wants to make sure that they are prepared for the inspection. The restaurant will usually call ahead to let the health department know when the inspector will be coming. This allows the restaurant to make sure that everything is ready for the inspection and passes the inspection with a good score.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cars get better gas mileage on \"highway miles\" rather than \"city/town miles\"?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between \"highway miles\" and \"city/town miles\"?\n\nHuman: Highway miles are typically longer and straight stretches of road with less stop-and-start driving, allowing cars to maintain a higher speed and therefore get better gas mileage. City/town miles are typically shorter, more congested stretches of road with more stop-and-start driving, resulting in worse gas mileage.", "\n\nHuman: How do the new quantum equations suggest to scientists that the big bang didn't happen the way we thought it did and that the universe is infinitely old?\n\nEDIT: If correct, how does this change our understanding of \"the early universe\" - the cosmic microwave background radiation, the disassociation of the forces of nature, the synthesis of particles, etc.?\n\nAssistant: The quantum equations suggest that the big bang didn't happen in a single instant, but instead was an infinite series of big bangs and infinite regressions, occurring infinitely often and infinitely quickly. This suggests that the universe is eternal and has existed for an infinite amount of time. It also suggests that the cosmic microwave background radiation, the disassociation of the forces of nature, and the synthesis of particles occurred an infinite number of times and in different ways, making it impossible to definitively say what exactly happened in the \"early universe\".\n\nHuman: Does this mean that the laws", "\n\nHuman: Why are politicians expected to release their tax returns?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because it allows voters to see how much money their candidates are making and how much they are paying in taxes. It also allows them to hold their candidates accountable for their financial decisions.", "\n\nHuman: Why do package delivery people's handheld devices make such loud beeping noises?\n\nI work in an office where packages get delivered every day, and I can hear the beeping all the way up and down the hall. It seems to be for all carriers (USPS, UPS, FedEx, etc.). Wouldn't a normal volume beep be sufficient?\n\nAssistant: What kind of package is it? \n\nHuman: It's usually a small box or a bag.\n\nAssistant: What type of device is making the noise? \n\nHuman: It's a handheld device that the delivery person is holding.\n\nAssistant: Is it a barcode scanner? \n\nHuman: No, it looks like it's a regular handheld device with buttons and a screen.\n\nAssistant: Is it possible to ask the delivery person to lower the volume of the beeping? \n\nHuman: I'", "\n\nHuman: What is Stalling (flight)?\n\nWhat exactly is stalling? I tried reading the Wikipedia article but it was way too complicated for me to understand still.\n\nAssistant: Well, stalling is when a vehicle or aircraft experiences a decrease in airspeed to the point where the airflow over the wings is no longer sufficient to generate lift, causing the vehicle to fall from the sky. In other words, it's when a vehicle or aircraft loses the ability to fly."]}
