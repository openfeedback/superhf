This decision was upheld by the Iowa Supreme Court, which ruled that the sixth amendment right to a fair trial was not violated.", "\n\nHuman: Why can't humans consciously control certain bodily responses and functions?\n\nFor example, (if I understand correctly) if pain is a warning that something is wrong, why can't we 'tell' our brain to stop sending those signals once we realize what it is?\n\nAssistant: That's a great question.  The answer is that the brain is highly complex and the control of pain is regulated by many different pathways and processes. Pain is often caused by the brain's interpretation of signals from the body, and it can be difficult to change how the brain perceives these signals. Additionally, the body has its own autonomic nervous system that controls many physiological responses, such as heart rate, digestion, and breathing, and these responses are largely involuntary.", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sunlight exposure causes the skin to produce vitamin D when ultraviolet B radiation from the sun interacts with a chemical in the skin called 7-dehydrocholesterol. This interaction converts the 7-dehydrocholesterol into vitamin D3, which is then absorbed by the skin cells and converted into an active form of vitamin D.", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the cause of the flickering in the videos?", "\n\nHuman: How does the box office work?

All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: I can provide an example. Let\u2019s say you have a room that is currently at 75 degrees, but it was recently at 85 degrees. Even though the temperature has dropped, the room will still feel hot because the object (air) in the room has retained the memory of being hotter, and it will take some time for the air to cool back down to 75 degrees.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: 8-core AMD CPUs are more powerful than 6-core Intel CPUs.  They have more cores and thus can execute more instructions in parallel, which leads to higher performance.  However, Intel CPUs have higher clock speeds, which gives them an advantage in some tasks.  Generally, for the given price range, the 6-core AMD CPU is the better choice, as it offers good performance for the price.  The 8-core AMD CPU is better suited for more demanding tasks.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but it could be related to the need for sleep. It could be that your body is craving more rest and is trying to tell you to get more sleep.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: They use a set of predefined keyboard commands. For example, a single click is usually equivalent to the mouse moving to the center of the screen, while a double click is usually equivalent to the mouse moving to a double the size of the single click location. This is known as the mouse's \"click distance\" and is typically set by the user. The mouse also sends information to the monitor, such as what type of button was pressed and the amount of pressure applied. This information is then interpreted by the monitor as a command.", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They use a reflecting surface, such as a shiny tabletop or a pool of water, to create a realistic reflection.

Why?\n\nAssistant: Because restaurant-made Chinese food is usually made with fresh, high-quality ingredients and authentic cooking techniques that cannot be replicated in a home kitchen.  Additionally, many restaurants have chefs who specialize in Chinese cuisine and have years of experience making it, while most home cooks do not.  Finally, restaurant-made Chinese food is usually made to be flavorful and appealing to a wide range of palates, while home-made Chinese food may not have the same level of care and attention to detail.

This version of English has its own rules for spelling, grammar, and pronunciation. The British version of English follows the rules of British English.\n\nThe reason Americans do not pronounce the 'H' in words like \"herb\" is because the 'H' is silent in some words in American English.

The LHC could also open the door to exciting new opportunities in medicine, technology, and other fields.", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The differences between right political parties and left political parties are mainly based on their ideologies. Right-wing political parties generally favor a smaller government with less regulation, lower taxes, and a more traditional view of society. Left-wing political parties generally favor a larger government with more regulation, higher taxes, and a more progressive view of society.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Time does not work that way. Time is relative to the observer. The time it takes for a spaceship to travel between two points depends on its speed and distance. The speed of light is the same for everyone, so when the ship moves faster than light, time will slow down and when it moves slower than light, time will speed up. When the ship reaches its destination, the time it took to get there will be the same for everyone, regardless of the distance.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the exact question you're asking.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Because children make up a large percentage of the population in any given era, so it stands to reason that their remains will be found more often than those of adults.  Additionally, children tend to be buried or interred in special locations, such as burial sites or sacred places, which makes them more likely to be found.  In many cultures, it was also common for parents to intentionally kill their children in order to ensure their passage to the afterlife, resulting in the preservation of their remains.  Finally, some cultures practiced infanticide or child abandonment, also leading to the preservation of", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I believe the physical differences between males and females of a species are determined by the roles that each gender is designed to fulfill in that species. For example, males are generally larger and stronger than females in order to be able to compete for mating rights and to protect the female and their offspring. In humans, females are typically smaller and weaker than males, but they have a higher fat content in their body which allows them to reproduce more efficiently.", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: No, there is no theoretical or practical limit to the amount of information that can be sent through the cable internet.  The limit is determined by the bandwidth of the cable, which is usually very high.  The higher the bandwidth, the more information that can be sent.  Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be transferred in a given amount of time.

This is a paradox because it means that a set can both be in and not be in the same set.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: The views on transsexuals in Iran are rooted in the teachings of the Quran and Islamic law. Shia Islam, which is the official state religion of Iran, takes a more accepting stance on transsexuals compared to other branches of Islam. Under the Iranian law, transsexuals are allowed to legally change their gender and are given the same rights and protections as other citizens. This is in contrast to other countries in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, where being transgender is still a criminal offense. Additionally, Iran has a vibrant transsexual community, with", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: It could be a variety of reasons. Many medicines have side effects, including depression, due to the way they interact with the body's chemistry. It could also be a psychological effect of taking medicines regularly. Some people may become depressed if they feel like they are not in control of their own health, or if they are not feeling better after taking the medicine. Other factors such as age, genetics, and a family history of depression can also increase the risk of depression developing as a side effect.", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear? Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: - Oceans, lakes, and rivers are typically blue or green because of the way light interacts with the water molecules.

Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: That is a good question. Generally speaking, smaller animals tend to have shorter lifespans because their metabolisms are more active and thus use up more energy, which is in limited supply. Larger animals tend to have slower metabolisms and thus can live longer. However, there are many exceptions to this rule, such as the bowhead whale which can live up to 200 years.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because that's the traditional way of referring to them.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number.
