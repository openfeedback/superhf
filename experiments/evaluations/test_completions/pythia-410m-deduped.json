For instance, the repeating decimal 1.111111... is infinite, but you'll never find a 5 in there along the way. However, infinitely repeating numbers and an infinite universe (or infinite number of universes) seem like an entirely different concept.\n\nAssistant: So, if the universe is infinite, it's because of time, right? So if you're a little girl that lives in the future, you can't just go to the future, because you're not in the same universe as the girl you're going to be. So I assume you're saying that if the universe were finite, you could just go back to the past to get to the girl you're going to be.

I, for one, certainly think they deserve the recognition.\n\nAssistant: I would be willing to bet the $$$ that the cast and crew deserve it too. We've seen some amazing acting. We've seen some amazing writing. We've seen some amazing directing. We've seen some amazing directing.\n\nYou're right about the cast, but I'd wager that the reason is more than simply the casting.
