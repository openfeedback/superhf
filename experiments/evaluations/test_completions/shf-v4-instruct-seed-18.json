How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The way you experience time is not related to your location in the universe. Your perception of time is dependent on your location in space.\n\nTime is a measurement of change. When you move your hand, it moves because of the change in your position in space. The distance between your hand and your body is changing, so time is passing. The speed at which your hand moves is also a measurement of time, so time is also related to the speed of motion.\n\nWhen you travel in space, you are moving at a different speed than you do on Earth.

Liberal arts colleges have been described as \"liberal\" in the classical sense of the term, emphasizing free inquiry and humanistic study.\n\nIn general, the more education a person receives, the more likely they are to be liberal. Liberalism is closely linked to humanism, which is a philosophical movement", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: When people speak, they have to use their lungs to send the air through their vocal cords to produce sound. When they sing, they use the same vocal cords but they only use their vocal cords to produce sound. When people sing, they use their breath to move the air through the vocal cords. When they speak, the lungs move the air through the vocal cords.", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Clouds are made up of tiny droplets of water. The water droplets are very small and light, and they stay suspended in the air because of the water's surface tension. The droplets are tiny, but they still have a lot of surface area. When the wind blows, the droplets bounce off of each other. Because the droplets are so small and light, they bounce off each other and off of the air, and they maintain their shape.\n\nThe droplets also bounce off of the air because of the air's surface tension.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is not a simple answer, but there are many factors that contribute to the lifespan of animals. Some animals live longer than others because they have a longer lifespan. These animals have developed ways to survive and adapt to their environments for a longer period of time. Some animals are able to adapt to their environments more than others.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are used in science to determine the accuracy of a measurement. In the example you gave, 25.75, it is the sum of 22.3 and 3.45. The first number, 22.3, is the result of a measurement, which will have a finite number of digits. 22.3 has 3 significant digits, since the number of digits after the decimal point is 3. The second number, 3.45, is the result of a calculation, which will also have a finite number of digits. The number of digits after", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver is a vital organ that is responsible for breaking down fats, producing bile to help break down fats, and removing toxins from the blood. The liver has two main functions: 1) it produces bile to help break down fats and 2) it breaks down fats and removes them from the blood. The liver is also responsible for producing blood clotting factors, which is why you should not take aspirin, Advil, or other pain relievers while you are on the blood thinner warfarin. When the liver does not work correctly, you", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high pitch ringing noise is called \"Hum\" and it is caused by the high-frequency AC power being generated by the power supply in the TV. Hum is generally present in older televisions. The reason for this is that the AC power supply is designed to generate a low frequency AC signal, which is then converted to a DC voltage using a transformer. The transformer is designed to work with the low frequency AC signal, and does not work well with the high frequency AC signal. The high frequency AC signal is thus converted to a DC signal, which results in a high frequency AC signal at the output. This", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries run out of power because chemical reactions inside the batteries produce electrons. When the electrons leave the battery, the battery becomes less positive and loses its charge. The chemical reactions inside the batteries also produce heat, which can damage the battery. This is why batteries should not be left in devices for a long time. When the chemical reaction inside the battery stops working, the battery stops producing electrons and stops working.\n\nBatteries also stop working when they are not connected to a device. This is because the chemical reaction inside the battery needs electricity to work. When the battery is not connected to", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: Children spinning in circles is a form of play that they love. It is a form of play that is often referred to as \"whirling\" or \"whirling around.\" Children love to spin in circles because of the physical pleasure and thrill that it provides. In addition, it is a form of play that often helps children to express their joy and happiness.

The show was known for its controversy, conflicts, and violence, and it was often considered to be a platform for the expression of society's lowest common denominators. The show's popularity led to its syndication and broadcast in many countries around the world.\n\nThe show was known for its controversy, conflicts, and violence, and it was often considered to be a platform for the expression of society's lowest common denominators.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: This is an interesting question, and one that is often debated. Cuteness is not a universal human trait. In fact, it seems that people's perception of cuteness is heavily influenced by their culture. For example, in Japan, babies are considered to be very cute, while in the US, babies are considered to be cute. This is likely because Japanese culture emphasizes babies and family, while the US culture emphasizes independence.\n\nPeople often find animals that are small, young, and/or vulnerable to be cute. This is probably due to our", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over ethernet is possible because ethernet is a twisted pair cable. Twisted pair cables transmit data through two wires that are twisted together. This prevents the transmission of signals between the two wires and reduces cross-talk. The data is transmitted on two wires, and these two wires are twisted together to prevent cross-talk. Cross-talk is when signals are transmitted on the same wire as the signal you are trying to receive. This is why ethernet cables have two wires.\n\nThe two wires are twisted together to prevent cross", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We can see colours because our eyes contain cones and rods. Cones can detect colours in the visible spectrum, while rods detect only shades of black, white, and grey. Cones are most sensitive to red light and least sensitive to violet light. The receptor cells in our eyes have three types of pigments: red, green and blue. The red and green pigments work together to produce yellow light, and the blue and green pigments work together to produce cyan light. Our brains then combine the signals from the three types of receptor cells to produce colour.\n\nCon", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 3rd world countries are underdeveloped because of their lack of infrastructure. They do not have access to good roads, hospitals, schools, or clean water. Their governments are not stable enough to focus on the welfare of their people. Some 3rd world countries have a very rich history of being colonized by other countries. This made them dependent on other countries. They did not have the resources to stand on their own. 3rd world countries also have a large population and very little land. They do not have enough land to cultivate food and do not have enough resources to develop their own", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: Government computers are accessible via the internet for two reasons:\n\n1. For some government services, a government employee may need to connect to a government computer from outside the government network, such as when a government employee is working from home, or when an outside contractor needs to connect to a government computer from a remote location.\n\n2. Some government computers are accessible via the internet to provide government services directly to the public. For example, a citizen may be able to access an online application to apply for a passport, or to check on the status of a passport application.\n\nThe first reason is sometimes called", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them because water is a natural component of many vegetables. Salt will increase the concentration of water, which will cause the water to leave the vegetable.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Your hands get wrinkly and soft because of the water. Water is a molecule made of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom. Water is a polar molecule because the oxygen atom has a negative charge and the hydrogen atoms have a positive charge. The water molecules attract each other because of the opposite charges. When your hands are in the water, the water molecules are attracted to each other and to the molecules in your hands. This is why your hands get soft and wrinkly.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The Apollo astronauts left equipment on the Moon that was visible to the human eye from the Earth, but it is not visible with telescopes. This is because the Moon reflects only 10% of the light that hits it, and the rest is absorbed.\n\nTelescopes see objects billions of light years away because they can see objects that are very far away and very bright. This is because telescopes have a very large mirror or lens. The mirror or lens collects the light from the object and focuses it on a sensor, which converts the light into an elect", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sodas and alcoholic beverages contain a lot of sugar, which can cause dehydration. Alcohol also depletes water in the body, and it can take weeks to fully recover from alcohol poisoning. Coffee is a diuretic, which means it increases the production of urine and makes you need to urinate more often.

I will probably have to give up and just continue to disagree with the explanations, but I'm hoping someone might be able to help me understand.\n\n\nAssistant: Thanks for the question. The Monty Hall Paradox is a probability puzzle. It is based on a game show where a contestant is given three doors. Behind one of the doors is a prize.\n\nThe contestant chooses a door, and the host, Monty Hall, opens a door behind which there is no prize. Then the host asks the contestant if they would like to switch to the other door.\n\nThe host knows which door has the prize behind it. The host knows that the contestant has chosen door #3, and that door #2 does not have the prize behind it", "\n\nHuman: when cannabis was still illegal in the US, how did high profile smokers e.g. Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogen etc. Not get charged for possesion?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question. The answer is that they were not charged because there was no law to charge them with. When cannabis was still illegal, there was no law in place that specifically criminalized cannabis use. However, there were laws that made it illegal to possess certain substances. These laws were used to prosecute cannabis users. There was also no law to prevent cannabis being used for medical purposes. However, this was often done in secret. The only people that knew cannabis was being used for medical purposes were the doctors that prescribed it and the patients who used it", "\n\nHuman: How can websites track you based on your monitor size?\n\nWhenever I try to use Tor in full screen, a message pops up that says, \"Maximizing tor Browser can allow websites to determine your monitor size, which can be used to track you. We recommend that you leave tor windows in their original default size.\"\n\nHow exactly does that work?\n\nAssistant: Tor Browser is a browser that enables you to use the Internet anonymously. It uses a network of relays to bounce your communications around the world to make it very difficult to trace them. It uses a combination of encryption and network obfuscation to hide your true location and identity. The Tor Browser is very secure, but it does have some limitations. One of the limitations is that it cannot protect you from sites that use browser fingerprinting techniques to identify your device. Browser fingerprinting techniques use characteristics of your device to identify you.

(Where R of human body is same)\n\n\n\nAssistant: Thanks for asking. Amps are the rate of current flowing through a conductor. This can be represented by the equation I=V/R. The amps are constant for a given voltage, but the voltage will be different if the current changes.\n\nThe human body is a conductor of electricity. When a high voltage is applied to the body, it will conduct electricity. The human body has a resistance of about 10^12 ohms. This means that for every 1 volt of electricity that is applied to the body, 1 amp of current will flow. This means that if", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't there psychotherapists who advertise themselves as working after 5pm?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Thank you for asking. There are actually many reasons why therapists don't advertise themselves as working after 5pm. First, many therapists don't work past 5pm, and it would be unethical to advertise themselves as working when they don't. Second, many therapists don't work after 5pm because they are unable to work after 5pm. Therapists are human beings, and they need to take time for themselves. If they don't take care of themselves, they won't be able to take care of others.
