The reason why a baby in the womb can be upside down for a long time is because the baby's body is able to adapt to being upside down. For example, the blood in the baby's body has a tendency to pool in one direction, which is why when you stand up it takes a while for the blood to flow back to your brain. But in the womb, the baby's body is very flexible, and it's able to adapt to being upside down for long periods of time.", "\n\nHuman: How does electromagnetism occur?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The way electromagnetism works is by the way the electrons move", "\n\nHuman: Bonuses.

This guy is one example, but there are many others. \n\nAssistant: You are missing the point. Bonuses are not supposed to be about how much money a company has lost under a person's control. Bonuses are supposed to be about how well the company is doing.

So, if a defendant attempted to murder a person by kidnapping them, beating them up and then stabbing them several times, the defendant would be charged with the crimes of kidnapping, assault and battery, and attempted murder. The jury would decide if the defendant had actually committed any of these crimes, and if so, what degree of each crime the defendant had committed.", "\n\nHuman: What are the functional differences between a Cray super computer and my 2.7GHz i7 desktop?\n\nI know technology has advanced to a point where I can buy for $500 a device with more computing power than anything built in say, 1990.

Water is a molecule that is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The oxygen atom is larger than the hydrogen atom and has a lone pair of electrons that is not attached to any other atom. The lone pair of electrons is the part of the oxygen atom that gives water a strong electronegativity and is the reason that water is a polar molecule. This means that water has a positive charge and a negative charge. This is why water is able to bond with other molecules and form a liquid.

When you use the Tor browser, a lot of websites will not be able to track you because they can't identify your IP address or your browser, but the Tor browser has a feature that detects if a website is trying to track you, and if it is, it will block it.\n\nWhen you use the Tor browser in full screen, the Tor browser uses a technique called \"virtualization\" to get around some of the limitations of the Tor browser.

The skin is the biggest organ in our body. It has a very important role, which is to protect the inside of the body from the outside world. It can do this by keeping the heat in, and keeping the cold out.\n\nThe skin is made up of many different types of cells. One of these is called a sweat gland. When you get too hot, the skin cells make sweat. The sweat is made up of water, salt and other chemicals. When the sweat is in the skin, the skin feels warm and moist.

Volts, however, are the potential difference between two points. The potential difference is equal to the work required to move a charge between those two points. If you want to do work, you need to have energy, which means that you need to have some voltage. If you have an electric charge, and you want to move it from one point to another, you need to have some voltage, and that's the voltage that kills you.
