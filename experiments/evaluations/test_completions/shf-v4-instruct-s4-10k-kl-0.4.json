Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Cable internet is limited by the speed of light, which is about 300,000 km/s.  This is about 10^17 meters per second.  This is the maximum speed for data to travel through a cable.  The maximum speed of data transfer through a cable is 1 Gbps, which means the maximum amount of information that can be sent through the cable is 1 Gbps.  This is the theoretical limit.  The practical limit is about 80% of this.  This is because the speed of light is not a constant and can be affected", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A sun dial is a device used for telling the time by the position of the sun.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I cannot provide you with a simple answer. The probability of a coin landing heads or tails is 50%.

Gases are composed of atoms or molecules that are far apart and move freely. When a gas is heated, it expands. The molecules move faster and further apart, and the gas becomes less dense. The air is less dense at higher elevations than at sea level, and this allows the air to rise and form clouds. When a cloud is blown through the sky, the wind carries the cloud and the air that is in the cloud. The air inside the cloud is less dense than the air outside the cloud, and so it r", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer?

There are many factors that can influence the lifespan of an animal, such as the environment it lives in, the food it eats, the temperature it lives in, and the amount of stress it experiences. A good example of this is the lifespan of a human being. People who live in cold environments tend to live longer than those who live in warm environments.
