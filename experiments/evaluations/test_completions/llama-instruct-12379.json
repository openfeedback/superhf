That seems counter-intuitive, since it's the irrational numbers that are infinitely \"moving.\" Please help me understand.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason you can't hit a rational number is because a rational number is either a fraction or a whole number. A fraction is a number that can be written as a/b, where a and b are integers. This means that a/b can be written as 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, 4/4, etc. This means that if you throw a dart at a number line, you are most likely to hit a whole number.\n\nA whole number is a number that can be written as a/b, where a and b are whole numbers. This means", "\n\nHuman: ELI5: how can babies in the womb spend weeks to months upside down without issue but any person outside of a womb would experience effects or even death in less than a few days?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Babies in the womb can be upside down for weeks or months, because the fluid around them cushions the impact.  Babies outside of the womb (ie. born) do not have this cushioning fluid around them, and so a fall will result in serious injury or death.  This is because the skull of an adult is much harder than the skull of a baby.  As they grow, they become much harder and will not sustain a fall as well.  This is one of the reasons why children need to be protected until they are 100% capable of taking", "\n\nHuman: How does electromagnetism occur?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Electromagnetism is the force that is produced when the electric and magnetic fields interact. Electromagnetism can occur in two ways:\n\nElectromagnetic induction is when a magnetic field is generated by a changing electric field. For example, if a wire carrying current is moved through a magnetic field, the wire will produce a magnetic field.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is when a magnetic field is produced by a changing electric field. For example, if a wire carrying current is moved through a magnetic field, the wire will produce an electric field.\n\nThese two phenomena are interrelated.

It was also significantly more", "\n\nHuman: why do milk alternatives [soy almond etc] get called milk and not *name* water?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I think that it is a marketing play, not a legal one. I believe that a company like Almond Breeze has an incredibly strong brand identity. They have a very recognizable logo and a very recognizable label. If you were to look at the label, you would recognize it. If you were to say the brand name, you would recognize it. It is a very recognizable brand. It has a very strong brand identity. I think that they would be foolish to change that brand identity to something that is not easily recognizable. I think that there is a recognition that a lot of people in the", "\n\nHuman: How come eggs harden when they are boiled while pasta softens?\n\nI searched this question first, and while I found one about eggs hardening, it did not explain the issue regarding pasta. As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: Eggs are mostly made up of water and protein. Protein is more rigid than water. When eggs are boiled, the water is removed from the eggs. The protein hardens, which is why the eggs harden. \n\nPasta is mostly made up of flour and water. When the water is removed from the pasta, the flour is left behind and it expands, which is why pasta softens. \n\nYou may have noticed that pasta made with eggs softens more than egg pasta. This is because the eggs have more protein and are more rigid than the", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The situation in Syria is that the government of Syria is being challenged by a number of forces including rebel groups, terrorist groups, and foreign governments. Russia is sending assistance to the Syrian government which is the current government in power. The opposition to Russia\u2019s assistance is that Russia is supporting the Syrian government which is accused of using chemical weapons and other atrocities against the Syrian population.

In batteries, chemical energy is released through a chemical reaction between a positively charged anode and a negatively charged cathode. The chemical reaction releases electrons into the battery. This process is called electrolysis. In this process, the negative ions move toward the positive pole and the positive ions move toward the negative pole. The electrons flow in a loop through the circuit. Batteries are used in a variety of devices such as automobiles, laptops, mobile phones, and watches. Batteries come in a", "\n\nHuman: Is there such a thing as a perfect circle?\n\nMerriam-Webster defines a circle as \u201ca closed plane curve every point of which is equidistant from a fixed point within the curve.\u201d Is the definition of a circle actually attainable?\n\nAssistant: There is no such thing as a perfect circle. There are many things that would make a circle not perfect.\n\nFor example, a circle with a lot of imperfections would include things like holes or blemishes. Or, a circle with a lot of imperfections would include things like a circle that is not a closed curve.\n\nA perfect circle would have zero imperfections. This would mean that the circle would have to be a closed curve, meaning it is a complete loop, with no gaps.\n\nThere would also be no holes in a perfect circle. This would mean that there would be", "\n\nHuman: what's the difference between the blue circle and the check mark and the white circle and the check mark ( on messenger )\n\nI understand that there is a difference between sent and delivered, but what does that difference mean?\n\nAssistant: The blue circle means that your message has been sent, and the white circle means that your message has been delivered.  So a blue circle means that the other person has received your message, but may not have read it yet.  The white circle means that the other person has read your message.  It is not always the same for the blue circle and the white circle.  Some people may have the blue circle and not have the white circle.  This means that your message is sitting in their inbox, but not yet read.  Some people may have the white circle, but not yet have the blue circle.

So where is it?\n\nAssistant: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is an accumulation of marine debris particles in the North Pacific Ocean.  It is not a single island and is not visible on Google Maps.  It's located somewhere between California and Hawaii and is about the size of Texas.  It's hard to find because of the lack of light and the fact that it is just debris in the water.  It is formed by the convergence of currents from North America and Asia that collect the marine debris.  The particles are so small that they are suspended in the water column and do not sink to the", "\n\nHuman: How are kidney stones formed so rapidly in comparison to actual stones being created in nature?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: Kidney stones are actually made up of minerals that are dissolved in the body. When the concentration of minerals reaches a certain level, they precipitate out and form stones. If the stones are small enough, they can pass through the urinary tract and are generally not a problem. The key is to prevent them from forming in the first place. \n\nThe most common causes of kidney stones are inadequate fluid intake, urinary tract infections, and kidney disease. \n\nSometimes people eat a diet that is very high in animal protein and low in vegetables", "\n\nHuman: Do eyes get tired from moving constantly during REM sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Eyes get tired from moving during REM sleep. Sleeping eyes move very quickly, and this causes fatigue. If the eye muscles are not exercised enough, the eyes become lazy.\n\nFatigue is a common problem for people who have to work on a computer all day. They tend to have tired eyes and have to take a break every hour or two. People who spend a lot of time at the computer should make sure that they are using a computer screen that is appropriate for their eye color and the lighting conditions in the room. They should also take a break every hour or two and look away", "\n\nHuman: Why is eye contact so important?\n\nSerious question!\n\nAssistant: Eye contact is important because it allows for a person to read the emotions of the other person.  A person who is not looking at you is more likely to be deceitful.  Eye contact also builds trust.  If you look someone in the eyes, you are communicating that you are open and honest.

There are two branches of the ANS, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic, which control the body's response to stress, and the resting state. \n\nThe sympathetic branch of the ANS is responsible for the fight or flight response. The ANS is a feedback loop, and the sympathetic branch is always active in some way, but it's activity is regulated by the parasympathetic branch. \n\nThe parasympathetic branch is", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Exposure to sunlight generates vitamin D by the cholesterol in the skin absorbing UV-B radiation, which then converts to vitamin D. Vitamin D is important for calcium absorption in the small intestine and bone health.\n\nFor some reason, the cholesterol in human skin doesn't absorb UV-B radiation as efficiently as it does in other animals, such as cows. This is why it's recommended that humans consume milk to get the amount of vitamin D they need, but cows can get it directly from the sun.", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Led flickering is when the leds in a video are not steady. There are many reasons this can happen such as the light being in a high speed shot, or the light being a strobe light.

For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The cost of a movie is the total cost of making the movie, from pre-production, to post-production, to marketing.  The box office is the amount of money that the movie earns from the theaters.  This number is a function of the amount of people that saw the movie, the number of theaters it was in, the price of the ticket, and the length of time the movie was in the theaters.  The profit is the amount of money that the theater makes after the distributor gets their share.  The distributor makes money by licensing the movie to the theater", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: The cancer rate of livestock is very low. In beef cattle, it is 0.0014% in 2013 according to the USDA. In the same year, the cancer rate for humans was 0.40%. \n\nWhen we eat cancerous cells, we don't get cancer. Cancer cells are not contagious.

My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth are those that are susceptible to pain, discomfort or irritation. There are many causes of sensitive teeth, the most common being tooth decay, gum disease or erosion. Other causes include brushing too hard, the use of abrasive toothpaste, receding gums, and excessive wear and tear. The first step to treating sensitive teeth is to visit your dentist to determine the cause. \n\nIf you have sensitive teeth, avoid brushing with a toothpaste that contains abrasives such as silica, alumina,", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: Hair gets that greasy feel when we don't wash it because the hairs on our head are dead. This means that they don't have the ability to clean themselves, and so they get dirty. Shampoo is full of chemicals that are able to break the bonds holding the dirt to the hair, so that it can be washed away.", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is a 1993 federal law which prohibits the federal government and the states from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion unless doing so is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest. The law was passed to protect the right of individuals to freely exercise their religion. The law was originally intended to protect religious practices from government interference. \n\nThe Indiana General Assembly passed a similar bill into law in 2015. The Indiana version of the law was passed as a response to the United States Supreme", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry is the idea that every particle in nature has a partner particle which is its supersymmetry partner. The partner is a supersymmetric partner, because it has the same mass as the original particle. The superpartner is a fermion or boson, depending on the original particle.\n\nA supersymmetric theory has the same massless particles as the Standard Model of particle physics. However, there are more particles in the supersymmetric theory than in the Standard Model.\n\nIn supersymmetry, the Higgs Boson is not the only Hig", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: It is believed that the palms of your hands are covered in a protective layer of skin that is much thicker and tougher than other areas of the body.

Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is an absolute lower limit on the precision with which we can measure position and momentum. In other words, the more precisely we measure one of the two quantities, the less precisely we can measure the other. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is important because it explains the existence of things like electrons and other subatomic particles.\n\nWe can't know both momentum and position precisely, because if we knew both, then the other would have to be zero. We can't know the momentum of an electron precisely, because if we knew the momentum precisely, we", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is the difference in behavior of a system as a result of its past history. This behavioral difference is typically referred to as lag.\n\nIn hysteresis, the system is slow to respond to a change in the environment. In fact, the system will continue to behave in the same way until a change in the environment forces a change in the system.\n\nFor example, if you put a thermometer into a hot cup of coffee and then remove the thermometer, it will take time for the temperature of the thermometer to reach the temperature of the coffee.\n\nThe temperature of the therm", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: Europe has a much longer and more complicated history than America, which is a relatively young country.  It also has a different political system, in which the government is much more involved in everyday life.  This means that Europe is better able to enact policies that would be more difficult to enact in a country like the United States.  Socialized medicine, for example, is not possible in the United States because the constitution does not allow it.  In Europe, countries have different policies, but most are similar.  In Europe, governments are much more involved in daily life.  They have more say in what people", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Rubbing the eyes is a natural reflex to relieve tired eyes. Rubbing the eyes causes the eye muscles to relax and the eyes to open wider. It is a form of massage and can reduce fatigue and tension in the eyes. Rubbing the eyes can also help clear any dust particles or other debris that may be caught in the eye. However, rubbing the eyes too much can lead to irritation or even scratches in the eye.\n\nIt is not clear why we have this natural reflex. It is possible that the eye muscles are not working correctly. It may also", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU will be negligible. I'd be shocked if it was more than 5% difference.\n\nThe reason for the price difference is that the Intel CPU has a much higher base price (due to the larger die size) and also has a higher TDP (it will cost more to cool it).\n\nThe AMD 6-core CPU has a TDP of 65W and the Intel 6-core CPU has a TDP of 95W.\n\nThe AMD 8-", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Eye twitching is caused by the eye muscles being tired. Eye muscles are the ones that move the eye. \n\nThe eyelids are a part of the eye muscles. So, when the eye muscles are tired, the eyelids may twitch. \n\nThe cause of eye muscles being tired is not well understood. \nIt is likely related to how the brain controls the eye muscles. \nThe brain may send a signal to the eye muscles to contract, but they don't get the signal to relax.\nThe eye muscles may", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: Cancer is a disease that can come and go, and is hard to track. \n\nIn the movies, the people with terminal cancer are almost always symptom free until the drop dead one day. \n\nI think it's probably not at all realistic. \n\nI think it's more likely that they have been symptomatic for a while and then have an event that causes them to drop dead, or that they have been symptomatic and drop dead one day. \n\nI think it's likely that the people in movies and books are symptomatic, and just", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This is a very broad topic, but here are some examples:\n\n- Hold music is played by a computer system, and as such, can be compressed in ways that is inappropriate for human ears.\n\n- Hold music is played by a computer system, and as such, can be compressed in ways that is inappropriate for human ears.\n\n- Hold music is played by a computer system, and as such, can be compressed in ways that is inappropriate for human ears.\n\n- Hold music is played by a computer system, and as such, can be com", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Middle East has been at war since the dawn of humanity. The only time that it was not at war was when the Romans conquered the entire Middle East and then created a peace treaty with the Jews that lasted until the Jews revolted and the Romans crushed them in the Bar Kokhba revolt. The Middle East has been at war since that time, and it has not stopped. The Arabs have always hated the Jews, and the Jews have always hated the Arabs. Even after the Jews were forced to flee from their land by the Romans, the Romans built", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is bad for you because it is calorie dense, so you need to eat a lot of it to get the same amount of calories from other foods.  It is also known to cause weight gain and can cause other health problems such as diabetes.\n\nCalories are the primary way we measure food energy, and food energy is the primary way we measure the energy needed to do physical work.  The average person needs about 2000-3000 calories per day to maintain their weight.  However, if you eat more than that, you will gain weight, and if", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week. However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: I'm not an expert on this but my guess would be that it's due to a combination of the following:\n\n1. To build a loyal audience, there needs to be a certain level of frequency. 5 days a week is a good frequency, so that's what they'll do.\n2. With a show like Kimmel, which has a big focus on comedy, I would expect it's an expensive show to produce. So if they only did it once a week, it would be difficult to generate a profit.\n3. I think the audience may appreciate the predictability of", "\n\nHuman: Origin of \"In Mother Russia...\" jokes\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The origin of the \"In Mother Russia\" jokes is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had a bad reputation for human rights and had a poor record of humanitarian aid to the rest of the world.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, the jokes about the Soviet Union were popularized by the internet.\n\nToday, the jokes are still popular and have been expanded to other countries, such as China and North Korea. \n\nAnother version of the joke is \"In North Korea\" or \"In China\".\n\nAnother version of the joke is \"In Soviet", "\n\nHuman: Colloidal silver?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Colloidal silver is a suspension of extremely small metallic silver particles in a liquid, typically water. The concentration of particles is measured in parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb). The particles are typically in the range of 0.0001\u20130.001 \u00b5m, so they are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye.\n\nColloidal silver is often promoted as a health supplement, but there is no reliable scientific evidence that it has any beneficial effect. It may cause argyria, in which the skin becomes", "\n\nHuman: Why do you \"drive\" a car, but \"pilot\" a boat, plane, etc.?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the past, automobiles were driven by a driver. The word \"driver\" is used in this context because of the similarities between driving a car and steering a horse and carriage. In the days of horse-drawn carriages, the driver sat on top of the carriage and controlled the horses. In the same way, the driver of a car controlled the car. In recent years, the word \"driver\" is used less often for this context. When referring to a vehicle that is not a car, the word \"pilot\" is used. The word \"pilot\" is used because of the", "\n\nHuman: Why do popular reddit posts tend to cap out around 4k up votes when there is such a big amount of people using reddit?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The popularity of posts on Reddit is dependent on the community at large.  Reddit has a large userbase but there are many more people using Reddit than actually active users.  This is a problem with most social media platforms in that not all users are active and there is a lot of noise.  Reddit has a very robust system of downvoting posts that are not up to their standards, and that combined with the inactive userbase makes it hard to tell the best posts from the worst posts.  Reddit has a voting system where users are able to downvote posts they do not like and upvote", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If the harder piece was a diamond and the softer piece was steel, it would break the steel. But if it was steel and the harder piece was a diamond, it would likely not break the diamond. \nIf it was a diamond and the softer piece was a diamond, then it would be a tie. \nIf it was a steel and the softer piece was a diamond, it would likely not break the diamond. \nIf it was a diamond and the softer piece was steel, it would likely not break the diamond. \nIf it was a steel", "\n\nHuman: Why does the Xbox One need a brick in between the outlet plug and the console where as the PS4 doesn't?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The PS4 does not have an outlet brick but is only powered by USB. The Xbox One needs to have a power brick so it can draw enough power from the outlet to work properly. The PS4 is limited to 2 amps of power while the Xbox One requires 15 amps. This is why the Xbox One needs the brick. \n\nThe PS4 also does not have a power brick because it only uses USB. The Xbox One needs to have a power brick so it can draw enough power from the outlet to work properly. \n\nThe PS4 is limited", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: Chlorophyll absorbs light at wavelengths of 400-700nm and reflects light at 600-700nm. \n\nPlants appear green because they reflect green light but absorb all other colors. \n\nThis is a result of the Chlorophyll absorbing light in the red and blue spectrum while reflecting green light.", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The answer is, you would not fail a test for THC if you have runners high. But, if you had THC in your urine, it could be a test for THC or marijuana, which is not runners high.  There are many chemicals in marijuana and cannabinoids, and these are all tested for by different tests.  The tests for THC, cannabinoids, and cannabidiol are not the same.  If you have a metabolite of cannabinoid, which is THC, or cannabidiol, you can have", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Viscosity is the resistance that a fluid offers to flow. It is defined as the ratio of shear stress to the rate of strain. The more viscous a liquid is, the harder it is for it to flow. Most liquids are viscous enough to flow. The only liquids that aren't viscous enough to flow are superfluid helium-4 and Bose-Einstein condensates.\n\nAt normal temperatures and pressures, the viscosity of a liquid depends on its molecular structure.  For most liquids, the viscosity increases as", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre is a high-stakes gambler, and Skyfleet is the airline he is investing in. His bet was that the stock would drop after the bombing, and he would make a profit.\n\nI guess that's the \"why\" question - why was Le Chiffre trying to sabotage the stock?\n\nThe \"how\" question is a bit more complex.\n\nLe Chiffre is a hedge fund manager, and hedge funds are, in essence, high-stakes gambles. When a hedge fund manager makes a", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: We are talking about two different things here. Mice and monitors communicate by sending and receiving electric impulses. These impulses are generated by your finger or the mouse, and they are received by the monitor and then displayed on the screen. \n\nMice and monitors are not related to each other, but the mouse is a tool to communicate with the monitor.\n\nMice and monitors communicate by sending and receiving electric impulses. These impulses are generated by your finger or the mouse, and they are received by the monitor and then displayed on the screen.\n\nMonitors and m", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot? \n\nThe easiest way to get this shot is to make the mirror a little smaller than the person\u2019s face. Then, the actor will be able to see themselves in the mirror. They can then look to the side and the camera will be able to get a shot of the actor\u2019s face without showing the camera in the mirror. If the actor is looking straight on at the mirror, it will appear that the camera is in the mirror.", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Circumcision is still a common practice in America because of religious reasons, cultural reasons, and medical reasons. Circumcision has been practiced for centuries for religious reasons in Judaism and Islam. In 2013, 77% of all American Jewish males were circumcised. \nThe practice of circumcision in the United States is common because of cultural reasons. Some cultures believe it makes a man more attractive to women, and some think it prevents penile diseases. In 2013, 55% of all American males were circumcised.", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The difference between Chess and Go is that Chess has a finite number of possibilities (or states) because it is a deterministic game. That means that it has a finite number of possibilities and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game. Go is not deterministic. This means that there is an infinite number of possibilities and the winner is determined based on experience and intuition. This is why Chess is more popular than Go.\n\nGo has a large number of possible states and the winner is determined based on experience and intuition. The game is more difficult to learn and it requires a lot of experience to", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: Chinese restaurants,  especially the ones that are popular,  are experts in the art of making Chinese food.  They've been doing it for decades,  and they know exactly how to make the perfect dish.  They know how to make it the way they want it to taste,  and they also know how to make it the way you want it to taste.  When you order something from a restaurant,  they know what to do with the ingredients,  and they know what to do with the flavors.  They know how to make a perfect dish every time.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When we try to look at something far away, the light that comes into our eyes is less intense than when we look at something up close.  Our eyes are not as sensitive to dim light as they are to bright light, so we squint to make our eyes more sensitive.  This allows us to see more clearly at a distance.  When we blink, we close our eyelids which helps our eyes to be more sensitive to dim light.  This is why we blink when we look at something far away.  Our eyes are sensitive to the bright light from the sun, so we squint to", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is made by dissolving carbon dioxide gas in water, the process is called carbonation. The process of carbonation involves the addition of carbon dioxide gas to water. The process of carbonation is a chemical reaction that results in the formation of carbonic acid. In this reaction the carbon dioxide gas reacts with water to form carbonic acid. The resulting carbonic acid then dissociates into carbon dioxide gas and water. The resulting carbon dioxide gas is what makes the carbonated water fizzy. Carbonation is used to make many beverages and soft", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Americans spell their words differently to British English due to the fact that America was settled by the British and therefore the spelling has stayed the same since the 1600's. When the British left America they took the English spelling with them and therefore the Americans have kept it the same. As for pronouncing the h in herb, this was a phonetic spelling change that was made to make the pronunciation easier, and it was adopted by both the British and Americans.", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The temperature of the shower water changes so much with a tiny push because of the thermal gradient between the hot water source and the cold water source. This gradient causes the hot water to mix with the cold water, so the temperature of the water is the average of the two temperatures.\n\nThe thermal gradient between the hot water source and the cold water source is caused by the different resistances of the pipes carrying the hot water and cold water. The hot water pipe has a smaller resistance than the cold water pipe, so the hot water has less resistance and travels faster than the cold water. The faster hot water travels", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014. What has happened during the last 12 months? Is the situation better or worse?\n\nAssistant: ISIS is an acronym for \"Islamic State of Iraq and Syria\", but the group is now known as \"Islamic State\" (IS), or \"Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant\" (ISIL). The \"Levant\" is a region in the Middle East that includes Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, Cyprus, and parts of Turkey and Iraq. IS is a Sunni Muslim extremist group that has declared itself the only legitimate government in the region, and the leader of the", "\n\nHuman: How does having a record label help bands, and how would an indie label differ from a major label?\n\nI've searched this many times but have yet to get a clear answer. anyone have a simple explanation that could be a little more clear?\n\nAssistant: It's all about distribution. Record labels can make it easier to get your music out to the public. Independent labels are generally smaller, and sometimes more focused on a particular genre. Major labels often have the advantage of better distribution, but also often have higher requirements for artists, and a smaller percentage of revenue going to the artist.\n\nFor example, in the past, if I wanted to buy a copy of the album \"Synchronicity\" by The Police, I'd have to go to the record store, find the album, and buy it. The record store would then pay the record label for the album.", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Trains pull so many cars because they have so much power. A train can pull up to 15,000 tons of cargo. The limit to the amount of weight they can pull is that the engine can pull up to 4,000 tons of weight. \n\nIf you look at the size of the engine, it is pretty small compared to the rest of the train. This is because the rest of the train does the heavy lifting. The engine only gives the train the power to move. \n\nTrains have a certain amount of power that they can use. This is called their", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics are not translated into modern text without a modern reference. Ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics are translated into modern text with a modern reference. The modern reference is the knowledge of how the ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics are translated into modern text. Ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics are translated into modern text with the use of the knowledge of how the ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics are translated into modern text. Ancient scrolls", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Well, when things are wet, they have a higher concentration of the particles that make up their smell. A wet dog or fart has more of its own smell than a dry one. As a result, a wet dog smells like a wet dog, and a wet fart smells like a wet fart. \n\nAlso, wet things are more likely to release their smell when they are touched. \n\nWhen wet things are touched, the smell is released. A wet dog is more likely to be petted than a dry dog. \n\nFinally, wet things have more", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world. It is designed to allow researchers to discover new particles and understand how they interact. The LHC is a circular ring of 27 km in circumference. Two particle beams are circulated around the ring in opposite directions at close to the speed of light. The beams are made up of protons. The two beams are accelerated to almost the speed of light and then brought into collision with each other. The collision creates a huge number of new particles that are detected by the detectors around the", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Right and left political parties are not an either or situation. They are on a spectrum, with some parties being closer to the left and others closer to the right.\n\nFor example, the Democratic Party in the United States is considered to be on the left, while the Republican Party is on the right. Other countries have different parties, but the general idea is the same.\n\nSome political parties are considered fascist or communist. Fascism is a philosophy that believes in a strong leader, the government should control the economy, and the government should be on the right side of history. Communism is a philosophy that", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: I have read a lot of science fiction and seen a lot of science fiction movies that describe time as being fluid, or changing depending on where you are in the universe, so the time it takes you to travel between galaxies is not necessarily measured by your watch. There are many different ways to measure time, and the speed of light is just one way to measure time. \n\nThe speed of light is 186,000 miles per second, so you can imagine a light year is how long it takes for light to travel one year. So if you travel at the speed of light for a year, then", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter was first defined in 1795 by a Frenchman called Pierre Bouguer. He was a scientist who wanted to standardise the measurements that people use to calculate the distance between the stars. The meter was initially defined as 1/10,000,000th part of the distance from the North Pole to the equator. That was a lot of effort to go to just to define one length. However, this was a good thing to do because if you define one length it makes it easier to calculate any other length.\n\nThe problem with this definition was that it", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is because your brain is more developed as an adult. As a kid, your brain hasn't developed enough to know that getting soap in your eye is bad. As an adult, your brain has developed enough to know that getting soap in your eye is bad, but you have also developed enough to know that it won't cause the same pain. \n\nAs a kid, when you get soap in your eye, your brain doesn't know it's bad, so you have a lot of pain. When you get soap in your eye as an adult, your brain knows it's bad, but you have", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Scientists have been looking for the 9th planet for decades.  The planet would have to be several times the size of Jupiter, and it would be located at the outermost edge of the Solar System.  It would take billions of years for it to make a single orbit around the Sun.  We can't detect the planet because we don't have the technology to detect it, but we can see its effects on the orbits of other objects in the Solar System.  Scientists have seen a large number of objects with unusual orbits, which makes them think there must be some large", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Black widow spiders are not the type of animals you'd like to eat. When they do so, it's because they're starving and need the protein. In fact, in their entire life cycle, they eat only about 12 meals. \n\nThe black widow has a short lifespan of only two to three years and eats only about 12 meals in its entire life cycle. \n\nThe female black widow eats her mate after mating because she needs the protein. She then spins a cocoon and dies soon after.", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Lemons and limes are often bitter but have a high water content and are very acidic. This makes them unattractive to animals and discourages animals from carrying the seeds away from the parent tree. \n\nLemons and limes are also very perishable. They are usually sour and bitter when picked, but quickly turn into a sour and bitter juice. This is why they are not often eaten raw, but are usually used to make beverages, such as lemonade, or to make sauces, such as lemon butter. \n\nLem", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: Some movies pay a fee per placement, some pay based on the size of the screen. For example, a product in the opening scene of a movie may cost $10,000, while a product in the closing scene may cost $100,000.  The producers of the movie will specify how subtle or obvious the placement should be, such as \"In this scene, a character is shown drinking a bottle of this brand of soda, but the brand is not shown.\"  In general, the placement is more subtle in the beginning of the movie and", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: When you click on the link in the Word document, it first checks if the link exists, then tries to access it.\n\nIf the link exists and the Word document and the browser are on the same network, Word first sends the browser a request to open the link.\n\nThe browser has to accept the request first.\n\nThe browser then sends a request to the computer where the website is hosted.\n\nIf the browser can't connect to the computer hosting the website, it will show an error message.\n\nIf the browser can connect to the website, it will send the website to the computer hosting the", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: Horses are killed to help reduce the number of unwanted horses.\n\nWhen a horse is injured or falls sick, the best treatment is to euthanize the horse. Many horses are injured and fall sick because of their owners' negligence. When horses are injured, they often require extensive and expensive medical treatment. This treatment is not always possible, because the owners do not have the money to pay for it.\n\nSometimes, horses are euthanized because the owners do not want to pay for their medical treatment. For example, if a horse owner is broke and does not have", "\n\nHuman: Why is Cyprus still split in half.\n\nI understand why it was split with the Greeks and Turks fighting over it but why like 30 years later is it still divided? You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: Cyprus was split between the Greeks and Turks after the 1974 Turkish invasion. Since then, no settlement has been reached and the two parts remain independent. The Greek side is a member of the EU and has been since 2004. The Turkish side has applied for membership but has not yet been accepted. This is primarily due to the fact that no settlement has been reached. \n\nThe current Greek Cypriot President, Nicos Anastasiades, has been in talks with the Turkish Cypriot President, Mustafa Akinci, since 201", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Children are not as large as adults and their bones tend to be more fragile.  This means that they will be more likely to decompose quicker in the environment and be less likely to survive in a fossil state.  Also, since they are smaller, they are less likely to be targeted for cannibalism.  If the people who ate them were cannibals, they are also less likely to be targeted.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In species that have sexual dimorphism between males and females, the difference between the two can be as simple as the male having a large antler and the female having a small antler, to a more complex difference like the male having a long tail and the female having a short tail.  The differences between the two sexes can be found in all sorts of species and can be extremely subtle.  The reasons for this can be because of evolution or because of the environment.  If the environment is extremely dry, the lionesses are more likely to have large tails to help them move through the dry desert while the males", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: There is no theoretical limit to the amount of information that can be sent through a cable internet connection. Practically, there is a limit to the amount of information that can be transmitted through the wire because there are physical limitations to how much information can be transmitted. Bandwidth is a measure of the amount of information that can be transmitted through a wire. It is measured in bits per second (bps). The higher the bandwidth, the more information can be transmitted through the wire. For example, a 500 Mbps cable internet connection can transmit about 500 million bits of information per second", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Before alarm clocks, people had to wake up at a certain time by themselves. This could be done with an alarm clock, but could also be done by setting a fire in the kitchen and running away, or getting a servant to wake up.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Each coin flip is 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before.", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun was a game controller that was used to shoot at enemies in a variety of games. It was a standard controller for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The light gun was attached to a TV screen and shot at enemies using a visible laser.\n\nThe laser would go through the screen and into the console, which would sense when the laser was on the screen. The gun was only able to track the laser, and would not work with any other light source or laser of a different frequency.\n\nIn order to prevent", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This can happen if a person has been in the US for a long time and has no records of where they live, family, etc. A person who is undocumented may not even know the country they were born in. \n\nThere are a number of ways a country can deport someone. The process varies from country to country. \n\nThe country can issue an arrest warrant and attempt to deport the person back to the country they were born in. This is a slow process, and can take a long time. \n\nThe country can issue an order to deport. This is faster than a warrant", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.00 because of the fact that 0 divided by 0.00 is the same as 0 divided by 0. It is the same as 0/0. 0 divided by 0 is 0.00 which is the same as 0 divided by 0.00. 0/0.00 is 0 divided by 0.00. \n0 divided by 0.00 is 0/0.00. 0 divided by 0.00 is 0/0", "\n\nHuman: why does comcast Internet slow down despite offering 20+mbps\n\nAssistant: Comcast Internet slows down because it is not capable of delivering 20+ mbps.  Comcast is a cable internet service, which has a lot of overheads, because of which it can only deliver a fraction of the bandwidth it promises.  Comcast is very good at delivering the bandwidth it promises.  Most of the time it is faster than what it promises.  But sometimes the connection gets clogged up by other people in the neighborhood, which makes it impossible to deliver the bandwidth.  Sometimes the connection gets slow because of the device you are using.  For example,", "\n\nHuman: how do apps like prankdial work?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Prankdial is a phone number that you call that makes prank calls to other people. This is done by using a computer to make the phone call, and then the person on the other end of the line is unaware that it is a computer making the call. This is done by playing a prerecorded message that sounds like a person, but is actually a computer. There are different types of these apps, including prankdial and prankcall.\n\nThese apps are not the same as a voicemail box that is set up to play a message. The difference is that prankd", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens if you ignore medical bills? [USA]\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: If you ignore a medical bill, you will likely end up with a collection agency, which can damage your credit. This could potentially lead to a bankruptcy. \n\nMedical bills are not \"ignoreable\" as they are often very expensive. \nIf you can't pay the bill, it's best to call the provider and explain your situation. Most providers will accept payment plans, and may offer free financial counseling. \nAlternatively, if you can afford the medical bill, you should pay it in full. \nIf you can't afford to pay it in", "\n\nHuman: If I smoke pot, and a week later get in a car accident where someone dies, will i go to prison?\n\nI know whenever someone is seriously injured or killed in a car accident, both drivers blood are taken to check for intoxication.  Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: I'm not a lawyer, but here is my take.", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: The expression \"one another\" has come to be used in English to mean \"one another person\", and is found in phrases such as \"one another is better than none\".  It is derived from the Latin phrase \"alter alterius\", which means \"other to another\".  This is a very old expression, dating back to at least the 12th century.  The Latin phrase is used in several different contexts, including \"one another day\", \"one another night\", and \"one another hour\".  In the 15th century, \"one another\" was used to mean \"one and the", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: There are two reasons why a toilet seat comes with plastic bolts and wing nuts. Firstly, they are a lot cheaper than a metal bolt and a wing nut. They are also easier to produce as they don't require any cutting or machining. The second reason is that they are much easier to put on and take off a toilet seat. A metal bolt and wing nut are much more difficult to work with and they are also harder to put on and take off the toilet seat. \nThe plastic bolts and wing nuts are also much more durable than", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: Growing up is a complex subject. It is a time where you learn what it means to be an adult, and what it means to grow. It is a time of change, and of transition. You go from being a child, to being an adult. You go from being dependent, to being independent.\n\nGrowing up is a process, and it can take different paths. Some people grow up quickly, and others grow up more slowly. Some people are ready to grow up at 16, while others are not ready until they are 25.\n\nGrowing up is not a linear", "\n\nHuman: If there's being such serious human rights violations goiing on in Qatar, and FIFA aren't doing anything about it, then how come none of the world governments or the UN are putting pressure on something to be done?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The UN have the power to pass resolutions. If one of the UN member states has breached human rights, the UN can investigate and pass a resolution calling for that state to improve their human rights record. The UN also has the power to impose sanctions on a state that has breached human rights. The UN has done this in the past with North Korea and Myanmar. The UN can also send peacekeepers to a troubled area to help the local people. In the case of Qatar, the UN has not passed any resolutions or imposed sanctions on Qatar. They have not sent peacekeep", "\n\nHuman: Sure Deposit\n\nI am being told that, despite having deposit in the name, it's just an unrelated fee.  I'm having trouble finding information on sure deposit, it seems like I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nAssistant: Sure deposit is a fee that some banks charge customers to deposit checks. There are usually a number of fees associated with a bank account, such as overdraft fees, wire fees, NSF fees, etc. The amount of sure deposit varies by bank, but it is usually around $25.\n\nSure deposit is not related to the sure deposit you have in your savings account. The sure deposit you have in your savings account is an FDIC insured account and your money is safe there.\n\nBanks charge sure deposit because they have", "\n\nHuman: If viruses such as Ebola have no cure, how come some people recover from the disease?\n\nHow come the virus doesn't keep multiplying until it kills the person?\n\nAssistant: The virus doesn't always multiply in the body. Sometimes it remains dormant in the body. Other times, the immune system may be strong enough to kill the virus.\n\nThere is also the possibility that the person can develop immunity to the virus and therefore, it doesn't kill them.\n\nThere is no cure for Ebola, but if a person does survive the disease, there is a chance that they will develop immunity.\n\nThe reason why some people recover from Ebola is unknown.\n\nIt could be that they have a stronger immune system, or it", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Many people have difficulty waking up in the morning, especially if you have a long commute to work or school.

This is the bodies way of preparing the body for the light that is coming into the eyes and therefore makes it easier to see. It is why the pupils of the eyes are referred to as the windows to the soul.", "\n\nHuman: Why do most men go bald, in spite of all the testosterone?\n\nI'm 25, I have a full beard, I have new hair coming out on my back and shoulders but the hair on top of my head have started falling. What's up with that? Are the rules different for that part of the body?\n\nEDIT: What the hell? Ads about hair products started showing on reddit.

Is there a biological dofference in their libido?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I think it has to do with a lot of different things. First, I think there's a lot of biological differences in the way that male and female brains are wired. I think that men are more prone to have impulsive sexual behavior, and that's because their brains have more testosterone. I think that women are more prone to have more calculated sexual behavior, and that's because their brains have more oxytocin.\n\nAnother thing I think is that men tend to be more sexually promiscuous, and women tend to be more selective", "\n\nHuman: We have vitamin A , B, C, D, E and K but not F, G, H, I and J. Why?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Vitamins A, B, C, D, E and K are the most important vitamins that the human body needs to function properly. Vitamins F, G, H, I and J are less important vitamins. Vitamin F is also called vitamin A palmitate. This vitamin is an oil-soluble vitamin that the body can synthesize. It is only available as a supplement. It is not necessary for the body to consume vitamin F. It is a source of vitamin A. Vitamin G is also called vitamin B11. It is a", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that sometimes I can poop with perfection only needing to wipe once and other times I need to wipe multiple times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There is no one single explanation for why we might need to wipe more than once when pooping. It could be due to the type of food we eat, the type of fiber we consume, the type of exercise we do, our gut bacteria, and even the time of the day we are pooping. For example, we might need to wipe more than once after eating a high fiber meal, as the fiber can stick to our poop and make it more difficult to poop. We might also need to wipe more than once if we have had a large amount of exercise", "\n\nHuman: What Is the Chomsky Grammar Heirarchy and How Does It Work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Chomsky hierarchy is a classification system of a language's grammatical features. It is a systematic method to determine the grammaticality of sentences. For instance, the sentence \"I am going to the movies\" can be classified as a declarative sentence because it is a statement. Declarative sentences are sentences that express a proposition, or a statement of fact or opinion. The sentence \"I am going to the movies\" is also a simple sentence. A simple sentence is one that does not contain any subordinate clauses or other grammatical structures. The sentence \"I am going to the", "\n\nHuman: why almost every japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children\n\nI have just noticed this trend tbh and i never wondered why this was. It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: I think you are correct, however, I think the reason is because of the target audience for anime. The target audience for anime is mostly kids or teenagers. And it is just that most anime are made for the audience that is between those ages. So I think it is just a coincidence that most anime are made for a younger audience.", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a state of decreased activity and metabolic rate, it is usually used to describe mammals but can also be used for invertebrates. This state is generally used when there is a lack of food or when the environment is too harsh to survive in. Hibernation is a state of deep sleep that is not very different from normal sleep. It is usually associated with a decrease in heart rate and body temperature. \n\nIn mammals, it is usually associated with decreased body temperature (from 37 degrees to 12 degrees Celsius) and a lower", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many reasons why speaking a language is more difficult than understanding it.\n\n* Speaking a language is a skill, and it takes time and effort to learn. When you are learning a new language, you have to remember many rules and concepts, and then put them into practice.\n* Speaking a language is more difficult than understanding it.

Braille can be found on signs for elevators, doors, and in public areas. It is also common for the blind to have a braille cane to help them locate the braille. The braille cane has a rounded handle, with a line of dots on the handle, which are the same as those found on the top of a braille cane. The braille cane also has a tip with small dots on it to help the blind feel their way around. The braille cane can be found", "\n\nHuman: What volume of water is required to drown a human?\n\nAnd a second, slightly sillier question, can someone drown swallowing only a mouthful of water?\n\nAssistant: The volume of water needed to drown a human is highly variable, and depends on a few factors. For example, if a human was submerged in water, and a person tried to keep the human afloat, the person would have to keep the human head above water in order to keep it alive.\n\nAnother factor is how much water a person has in their lungs at the time they are submerged. If a person is already submerged, they will drown in a matter of minutes, and even with a person keeping them afloat, the person would drown in a matter of minutes.", "\n\nHuman: what is the reason for those few extra blank white pages in the back of a book?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Those extra blank pages are called \"endpapers\" and are added to the back of the book to separate the book from the dust jacket.

Many people find that it is a relaxing and helpful practice.", "\n\nHuman: Why can insurance companies charge based on race/sex/age and not be sued for discrimination?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Insurance companies have been allowed to charge based on race, sex, and age because the law in the United States has historically protected companies from being sued for discrimination. For instance, it is legal to charge more for women's car insurance because women are statistically less likely to get into car accidents than men. This is an example of gender discrimination, but the insurance company has not been sued because the law protects the company from such lawsuits.\n\nAnother example of gender discrimination is charging more for women's health insurance because women are statist", "\n\nHuman: What is the dust on your eyes after you wake up?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: The dust on your eyes after you wake up is your eye lashes. Eye lashes are small hairs that grow on your eyelids. They protect your eyes from small objects, such as dust and bacteria. Your eye lashes are also a form of camouflage, and they help you blend into the background.\n\nEye lashes are also a sign of your age. As you get older, the hairs on your eyelashes get thicker and longer. They grow in clusters, so your eye lashes are made up of several", "\n\nHuman: How would a write in candidate win a national election considering that there might be and probably are other people with the exact same name?\n\nIn the context of people talking about write in candidates for this upcoming election, I was just wondering how this works.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: Write in candidates will not win a national election. The reason is that write in votes are not counted in a national election. The votes would not be in the proper state. However, in a state election, write in votes could count.\n\nA write in candidate will win a state election if they receive more votes than the margin of error in that state.\n\nHowever, the margin of error is usually small. The margin of error is usually +/- 3%. This means that a write in candidate would have to receive 97% of all votes to win a state election.\n\nAnother reason a write in", "\n\nHuman: How did people used to train pigeons to carry mail at the long distance, back in the day?\n\nI was always curious, did they have different pigeon for each address and if not, how pigeon knows whom to send? \n\nAssistant: People used to train pigeons to carry mail at the long distance by sending a pigeon from one place to another and if it reaches safely then they will release it back in the place where it was trained. \nThe pigeons were trained to carry mail from a person to the other person. So, they were not trained for a particular address.", "\n\nHuman: Why are people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war shamed instead of admired? Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is an interesting question. I think it's because there is an unspoken and unacknowledged belief that people who are not actively doing anything are not contributing anything to society. This is a flawed belief because the fact is that a lot of good things get done by people who are not actively doing anything. This is why I believe that people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war should be applauded instead of shamed. The fact that they did not participate in what was obviously a bad idea should be applauded, because they were not contrib", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, it has been possible to reconstruct the genome.  However, it is unlikely that the genome will be able to be replicated in the near future.  It is possible, but very unlikely, that a reconstructed Neanderthal genome could be introduced into a human egg and sperm and be able to be used for reproduction.  The likelihood of this happening is very low and is dependent on many factors including the success of creating a Neanderthal genome.  It is more likely that a Neanderthal genome will be", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender is someone who identifies as a gender that is different from the gender they were assigned at birth. A transsexual is a transgender person who has transitioned from their birth gender to their identified gender through medical or surgical means.\n\nA transgender person can be male, female, or non-binary.

This can result in people being happier. \n\nMar", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A lot of people love to drink alcohol. Some people are social drinkers and some people drink a lot. Some people prefer to drink at home, others prefer to go to bars and restaurants, and some people prefer to go to package stores.\n\nMost states have laws that restrict the number of package stores that can be in one area. For example, Connecticut has a cap of 6 package stores per town, 12 per city, and 18 per county. Massachusetts has a cap of 4 package stores per town, 12 per city, and 20 per county. Rhode Island", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Shrimp are rich in carotenoids, which are molecules with the same structure as vitamin A. When shrimp is cooked, it loses the carotenoids. When shrimp turns orange when cooked, it is actually the shrimp's natural color. The same can be said for beets, which turn red when cooked. However, the color of cooked beets is due to the presence of betalain, another type of carotenoid. \n\nRed meat, on the other hand, is a different story. When cooked, the iron in", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: This depends on the calculator you are using. Many modern calculators do not allow you to divide by zero. But in general, a calculator does not have a specific way of handling division by zero. It is simply a result of the way it is programmed. \n\nFor example, if you divide 1 by zero, you get an error. If you divide 10 by zero, you get an error. If you divide 100 by zero, you get an error. If you divide 1000 by zero, you get an error. If you divide 10000", "\n\nHuman: Why do people love eating fast food more often than having more \"natural\" food?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because fast food is more convenient, and fast food is also tastier, more cheaper, and more affordable.  Fast food is also more popular among the younger generation.\n\nAnother reason why people love eating fast food is because fast food is delicious.

Meaning, you had to live in the same block/city to connect to it? \n\n\nAssistant: A BBS or Bulletin Board System is a computer server that allows users to dial into it over a phone line to send messages to one another. It was sort of like an early version of the internet and is often thought of as the grandfather of the internet. It was used to communicate with people in your neighborhood and is what you might call a \u201clocal chat\u201d. Some BBSs were more advanced and allowed users to share files and upload them to the BBS. \n\nA lot of the time, BBSs were organized by city. This meant that only users in the same city could connect to one another", "\n\nHuman: What is Russell's paradox? and please explain like i am 5, i don't know anything.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Russell's paradox is the idea that there are sets that have themselves as elements.  For example, the set of all sets that do not have themselves as elements.  If the set of all sets that do not have themselves as elements exists, then it would have itself as an element, which is a contradiction.\n\nRussell's paradox is often used to illustrate the flaws in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, a popular mathematical theory.  Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory attempts to create a consistent theory of sets, which means that the theory should not be", "\n\nHuman: Why is Iran relatively accepting of Transsexuals?\n\nI was quite surprised to learn that Iran takes a fairly liberal view of transsexuals, particularly given the country's very conservative views towards homosexuality.\n\nI read the Wikipedia article: _URL_0_, but it doesn't seem to explain why this is the case.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: Iran is a very liberal and accepting country when it comes to LGBT+ rights, despite the very conservative views of the government towards homosexuality.\n\nThe country has one of the most liberal trans laws in the world, and is extremely liberal when it comes to transgender rights.\n\nA 2014 survey by the National Research Center on", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: Depression is a side effect of some prescription drugs. This is due to a chemical imbalance in the brain. It can be caused by a combination of ingredients in the medicine, or just one ingredient. It is the most common side effect of prescription drugs. The most common prescription drugs that cause depression are SSRI's, or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. They are used to treat depression and anxiety, but they can also cause depression and anxiety. The most common SSRI's are Prozac, Pax", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear? Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: - All of the above. The ocean, lakes, and rivers are blue because of the sky reflection. The sky reflects the light from the sun, and water is clear. The sky color is the color of the water.\n\nMost lakes and rivers are green because of the algae. It is hard to see the color of the algae because it is so dark and the light reflects off of the water.\n\nMany animals live in the water. Some of these animals are fish, turtles, crocodiles, dolphins, and much more.\n\n- The water is clear", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES Zapper for Duck Hunt doesn't work on new TV's because it used a light gun that required the light to be projected on a screen, and the light gun was only able to detect the light reflected off of the screen. In the case of the NES zapper, the light gun was able to detect the light reflected off of the screen. However, the light is not reflected off of the screen in the case of new TVs, so the light gun is unable to detect the light. As a result, the NES zapper doesn't work on new TVs.", "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between 32 and 64bit computer systems, and why aren't there, say 128bit systems.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A 32-bit system can only address 4GB of memory, a 64-bit system can address 16 exabytes of memory, and a 128-bit system could address 2128 (4 billion billion) bytes of memory.  The problem with larger numbers of bits is that the number of combinations that can be generated to represent the bits grows exponentially.  For example, the 32-bit system can represent 4 billion bytes of memory, and the 64-bit system can represent 16 billion bytes of memory.  However, the", "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is because task manager is a program that runs as a different process. It is like a different application. \nIf a program is frozen and you close it, it is still frozen. \nIf you ctrl+alt+del into task manager, it will stop the program. \nIf the program is frozen, task manager will also be frozen. \nIf you ctrl+alt+del into task manager, you will be able to access task manager and will be able to do things like end programs. \nThis is because task manager is not frozen. \nIf the program", "\n\nHuman: How will new gun laws prevent mass shootings?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: New gun laws will prevent mass shootings by requiring gun owners to undergo extensive training and mental health screenings to ensure they are of sound mind and able to responsibly handle firearms. This will prevent individuals who are not in a sound state of mind or who are unable to properly handle a firearm from purchasing and owning a weapon. Gun laws will also require gun owners to store their firearms in a safe manner to prevent accidental shootings and other mishaps.\n\nThe other way new gun laws will prevent mass shootings is by ensuring that guns are not purchased by people who have", "\n\nHuman: Why do banks offer interest? What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Banks offer interest in order to attract depositors to their bank accounts. People have a choice where they want to put their money and if they feel they can get a better return at a different bank, they will move their money to that bank. Banks offer interest to get depositors to open accounts.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for the bank? Banks can pay out less in interest than they take in deposits and still make a profit. Banks borrow money from other banks and other institutions and pay interest on those loans.\n\nThe bank makes money from interest on loans, fees for services like", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Income inequality in the United States is quite high, even by historical standards. For example, as of 2017, the top 1% of American families controlled over 30% of the nation's wealth, a higher percentage than in any other country in the world. This is also the highest percentage that the top 1% has controlled since 1928. The top 0.1% of American families controlled 15% of the nation's wealth, the highest percentage that the top 0.1% has controlled since 1928. The top 0.", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge? If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: Freeway overpasses have signs displaying the height of the bridge to help people with tall vehicles to plan ahead. \n\nFor example, if your vehicle is 16 feet tall, the signs are placed before the bridge so you can make a decision if you are going to travel under the bridge or not. \n\nIf you decide to go under the bridge, you have time to slow down or speed up to adjust to the height. \n\nIf you decide to go over the bridge, you have time to prepare to slow down or speed up to adjust to the height. \n\nIf you decide to", "\n\nHuman: How did the fireworks instantly kill the guy that put the shell on his head?\n\nI've been trying to figure out how it could have killed him instantly. I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: Most fireworks are designed to burn at a certain temperature for a certain amount of time. The shell was probably designed to burn at the correct temperature for a few seconds, but it was in the shell for several minutes. The shell was probably made of a paper like material that would burn at a higher temperature than the shell itself. The high temperature would melt the shell and cause it to become a liquid and spray the guy with the liquid. The liquid would burn the guy and probably cause him to die almost instantly. \n\nThis is just my guess, but I'm pretty sure this is how the guy", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: I don't know for sure, but I can offer a couple of theories.\n\nThe first is that as the temperature drops, the air becomes more dense. That means that the sound waves have to travel farther through the air to reach your ears, and so it takes longer for them to reach your ears. Since sound waves travel at a constant speed, they have to travel farther and therefore take longer to reach your ears.\n\nThe other possible cause is that the wind is colder, and so it is blowing harder. This means that the sound waves are traveling at a faster speed, and so they reach", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: The reason why liberalism and education are correlated is that more people in higher education are liberal, democrat, and left-wing. This is because they are educated, and the values they are taught are typically liberal, democratic, and left-wing.\n\nHowever, not all people who are educated are liberal, democrat, or left-wing.\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: This is because the pitch of the voice changes when singing, so the way the person talks also changes. For example, if you take a sentence like \"I want a banana\" and sing it, the pitch changes so it becomes \"I want a banana\". As a result, the way the person talks changes too. \n\nSo it makes sense that people sound different when they sing, because the pitch of their voice changes. \n\nHowever, the pitch of a person's voice does not have to change, for example if you take the sentence \"I want a banana\" and sing it with", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Clouds are made of tiny water droplets and ice crystals. When they are blown through the air, they have no rigid structure to maintain their shape, so they take on the form of the air flow around them. This is the reason that clouds can have many different shapes. \n\nWhen the air flow around the cloud is slow, the cloud takes on a more spherical shape. When the air flow is stronger, the cloud becomes flatter with a more rectangular shape. \n\nWhen the air flow is very strong, the cloud takes on a flattened disc shape. These clouds are", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a complex question and there is not a simple answer. The reason why smaller animals live shorter lives is because they have smaller metabolism, which means their body burns fewer calories. Because of this, the smaller animal needs fewer food to survive. With fewer food comes less resources. This is why there are many species of smaller animals that live shorter lives. However, larger animals with larger metabolisms need more food to survive. This means that the larger animals need to consume more food and therefore consume more resources. Therefore, larger animals have a longer life span. However, there are some exceptions such as the", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It is a custom that we call our parents mom and dad. The reason for this is that it is easy to say and easy to remember. Mom and Dad are short and simple, and both parents have a mom and a dad.\n\nMom and Dad are also a short way to say Mother and Father, which is too long to say. \n\nIt is also a tradition that we use the words mom and dad, and it is a tradition that we say mom and dad. \n\nThere are other terms that people use for parents, like mommy and daddy, but", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: 1) Significant digits are how many numbers after the decimal point are significant in a number. For example, 25.75 has 3 significant digits.\n\n2) Rounding and estimating are two different things. Rounding is when you take a number and remove all the numbers after the decimal point. For example, 25.75 would be rounded to 25.\n\n3) Significant digits is a way to determine how many significant numbers you can use to calculate with. For example, if you have a number like 22.3456, the", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Your liver stores bile, the bile is released into the small intestine by the gallbladder. The gallbladder is not really needed for breaking down fats. Your saliva and pancreas are the two main organs that break down fats.", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: It's called \"snow.\" Turning the TV on and off causes the electronics to generate a high frequency buzzing sound. The \"snow\" is actually a series of lines and dots that make up the picture.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries can run out of power because the chemicals inside the battery are used up. The chemicals inside the battery are used up when the battery is overused. The battery can also run out of power because the chemicals inside the battery are not made well. The chemicals inside the battery are not made well when the battery is made by a bad manufacturer. Batteries can also run out of power because they are not used for a long time. Batteries can run out of power when they are not used for a long time because the chemicals inside the battery are not used. Batteries can run", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: This is something that young kids love to do. I've seen it a lot. I've seen a kid spin in circles and not be able to stop, but I think it's just a natural thing for kids. When I was a kid, I used to spin in circles too. I didn't have any particular reason for it. I think it just happened naturally.\n\nThe first thing I thought of when I heard that a kid was spinning in circles was the children's song \"Wheels on the Bus\" that we used to sing in elementary school. It has a line \"", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Big Bang Theory is a theory proposed by physicist Albert Einstein that states that the universe came into existence by the creation of a single point in space with infinite density and temperature, which then expanded into what is now known as the universe. The Big Bang Theory is a scientific theory, and is accepted by the scientific community as the most accurate explanation of the beginning of the universe. However, it is not a law of physics, and cannot be proven, only disproven. It is considered a theory because it is not possible to test the theory at this point in time. \n\nThe Big Bang Theory is the prev", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The beat is the pulse of a song, and it is counted in 1, 2, 3, 4.

It is broadcast in the United States, Canada, and some other countries. It features guests talking about their problems, and then fighting with each other. The show is known for its tough-talking guests and the fights that they have on the show. The show has been on the air since 1991.\n\nThe Jerry Springer Show is one of the most controversial shows on television, because it makes fun of people, and encourages them to fight with each other. It has been banned in some cities and countries, because of", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: The term \"cute\" is difficult to define but it has been used to describe a wide variety of animals. The word \"cute\" is typically used to describe an animal that is very small and usually soft and furry. However, there is a large variety of animals that fall under the \"cute\" category and include animals like cats, dogs, piglets, and even some snakes. \n\nAs for why people find these animals cute, there are a few theories. The first theory is that people find them cute because they remind us of animals that are more commonly domesticated and that", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet (PoE) is the delivery of both electrical power and data communication signals over a single cable. The technology is often used in access points and wireless controllers to power devices like WiFi access points, cameras, and wireless controllers while transmitting data over the same cable. This is a significant advantage for a network administrator, because it eliminates the need for an extra Ethernet cable for power.\n\nPoE is based on the IEEE 802.3af standard for the delivery of power over Ethernet. It works by injecting a voltage onto the data signal that is", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 3rd world countries are underdeveloped because they are poor in resources, education, and opportunities. The reason they are poor in resources is because they have less access to good land, water, and natural resources such as forests, minerals, and animals. The reason they are poor in education is because they lack the funds to educate their citizens, and sometimes they are too poor to have the education necessary. The reason they are poor in opportunities is because they lack the resources to create opportunities for their citizens. This can be a lack of money, lack of education, or lack of government support. They", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: The internet is an open network that is accessible by everyone. The government computers are not accessible directly by the internet. They are connected to the internet via a network of computers. \n\nThe government computers are connected to a separate network to the internet. The internet is an open network that is accessible by everyone. The government computers are not accessible directly by the internet. They are connected to the internet via a network of computers. \n\nThere are firewalls and other security measures in between the government computers and the internet. But the internet is still open and can be accessed by everyone. So the government computers are connected to the", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cabbage, like other leafy vegetables, have a high water content. When you cut cabbage, you are cutting open the cells in the cabbage, and the water is released. This is why you should avoid cutting cabbage too finely as it will make the water release faster, and the cabbage will get soggy faster.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the salt will help hold on to the water, and it will slow the release of the water. This is why you might be able to add a tablespoon of salt to the cabbage, and the water will be released in an", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When your hands are in water for a long time, the water softens your skin and makes it easier for your skin to slide against your clothes.  This is especially noticeable when you are wearing gloves, and when you take off your gloves, your hands may feel a bit wrinkly because the water has made your skin more flexible.  This is similar to how a piece of raw meat feels soft and flexible when you cook it.  The water has made it softer, which makes it easier for the muscles and tendons to move.  When you take off the gloves, your hands get wr", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The reason that we can see objects billions of light years away, but not on the Moon is that the Moon is a small, relatively close object. If we want to see something in space, we need to be able to see it from a distance. This means we need to be able to see it from a far enough distance that the light from it hasn't had a chance to be absorbed or scattered by something in between the object and our eyes. This is why we can see objects billions of light years away, but we can't see the Apollo equipment on the Moon because the Moon is too close.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you drink something, your body will use some of the water in your body to help digest and process that drink. When you drink a drink that is not water, your body will not have the water to replace what it is losing in the drink. This will result in a dehydration. \n\nAlso, some drinks have caffeine in them. Caffeine is a diuretic, which means that it makes you urinate more often. This is a natural side effect of drinking coffee, and even soda. When you drink a diuretic, your body", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hispanic and Latino are similar but not the same.

Latino can be used to describe anyone from Latin America, from the Caribbean, or from Spain. Latino is used as an identity that", "\n\nHuman: Why do different countries have different outlets?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is based on the different electricity standards that exist in the world. Some countries use 120 volt, others use 220-240 volt, some use 100-120 volt, and some use 110-120 volt. The reason why some countries use different voltages is because some electrical devices in different countries require different voltages to operate. For example, in the USA, most devices are designed to run on 120 volt, but in Europe, most devices are designed to run on 220-240 volt. So", "\n\nHuman: How exactly does a terror organization claim responsibility for an attack?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Terror groups typically claim responsibility for attacks in one of three ways:\n1. Claiming responsibility on a social media channel\n2. Leaving a claim of responsibility in a written document\n3. Leaving a claim of responsibility through an online media release\nTerror groups typically claim responsibility in order to demonstrate their power and influence, as well as to attract new recruits. This is why terror groups will often claim responsibility for attacks that are not actually carried out by the group.\nIt's also worth noting that some terror groups will claim responsibility for attacks that are carried out by other terror groups. This is in", "\n\nHuman: The Monty Hall Paradox/Problem\n\nI was inspired by reading [this comment](_URL_0_) as well as the explanation given in the movie 21.\n\nThe basics of the problem, taken from the link above:\n\n >  the monty hall paradox, you are given a choice of three doors with a prize behind one, you pick door #3. door #2 is opened, there is nothing behind it. you are given the the choice to switch your choice from door #3 to door #1, doing so increases your chances of winning every single time.\n\nI know this has been posted before, but I can't for the life of me wrap my head around it. I will probably have to give up and just continue to disagree with the explanations, but I'm hoping someone might be able to help me understand.\n\n\nAssistant: The Monty Hall problem is a paradox.  The paradox is that the probability of winning is 100% (assuming you switch your door) even though the door you choose is 50% correct.", "\n\nHuman: when cannabis was still illegal in the US, how did high profile smokers e.g. Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogen etc. Not get charged for possesion?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because they were not in possession, they were merely in their home, a place they had a right to be, smoking in the privacy of their own home.", "\n\nHuman: How can websites track you based on your monitor size?\n\nWhenever I try to use Tor in full screen, a message pops up that says, \"Maximizing tor Browser can allow websites to determine your monitor size, which can be used to track you. We recommend that you leave tor windows in their original default size.\"\n\nHow exactly does that work?\n\nAssistant: Based on your monitor size, websites can determine if you are using a laptop or a desktop.  If you are using a laptop, your monitor is probably smaller than someone using a desktop.  If you are using a desktop, your monitor is probably larger than someone using a laptop.  The Tor browser uses this information to determine if you are using a laptop or a desktop.  By having this information, it can optimize the browser for the type of device you are using.\n\nIf you are using a desktop, the Tor browser can be optimized to minimize the number of mouse clicks you have to make.

Personally I'm interested in instead of full nation vs full nation how to subpopulations compare to each other? i.e. poor Americans vs poor Chinese, rich americans vs rich Chinese. Anyone familiar with this area?\n\nAssistant: The U.S. education system is great in many ways. We have a high level of education and have high performing schools in many places. We also have a lot of different schools and learning opportunities. However, the U.S. does have some issues in education. 1) The U.S. has a high level of student debt. Many students have to borrow money to go to college and have to pay that money back with interest. This is a problem because it makes it harder for people to start out in life. 2) The U.S. has a high level of inequality in education. Some", "\n\nHuman: Why does it take two separate machines to wash and dry clothes? Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sure, you could make a machine that does both. The biggest reason that they are separate machines is to save energy. In the past, when machines were not as advanced, it would use a lot of energy to have a machine that can do both. Nowadays, the energy consumption for both washing and drying is not as much, so it is more efficient to have them separate. \n\nAnother reason is that some people don't like to have their clothes get damp when they are washing them. This can be avoided when you have a separate dryer. \n\nThe last reason is that", "\n\nHuman: From crack to current, what is the story behind Toronto mayor Rob Ford?\n\nWhat has Toronto mayor Rob Ford been accused of doing?

He has also been accused of drunk driving and driving under the influence of drugs. He has also been accused of driving while impaired and having an inappropriate relationship with a female staffer. Ford has denied all allegations, but has admitted to smoking crack cocaine.\n\nFord has not resigned because his lawyers have successfully argued that he has not committed a crime, and that he has not broken any rules in his office.\n\nFord has also said", "\n\nHuman: Why are South American GDPs so erratic?\n\nEspecially Brazil, Chile and Argentina's \n\nAssistant: South American GDPs are erratic because the region's economies are dependent on commodities. These commodities, such as copper and oil, are highly dependent on global demand. When demand for these commodities is high, South American economies benefit from it. When demand is low, these economies are negatively affected. This can be seen in the recent years of 2009-2010 and 2011-2012.

The second period was characterized", "\n\nHuman: Why can we feel hot/sweaty, but when you touch your skin (or someone else does) the skin feels cold?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's because our skin is cooling down (like a sponge) when we are sweating. So when you touch your skin, it feels cold because it's cooling down.  When you touch someone else's skin, it feels cold because it's cooling down, but also because it's getting colder.  So it's both the sponge effect and the temperature effect.  But it's important to note that it's only the sponge effect if we are sweating, not if we are just being cold.  So if you touch your skin and", "\n\nHuman: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: People ask questions they already know the answer to as a way to gauge someone's level of knowledge, and also as a way to test their patience. For example, when you ask a question to your friends and they respond with the answer that you already knew, you will know that they don't have a high level of knowledge on the subject. When you ask a question to a stranger and they respond with the answer that you already knew, you will know that they are patient and polite. \nIn addition, people ask questions they already know the answer to as a way to see if they can manipulate other people to", "\n\nHuman: \"It's the amps which kill you not volts.\" But, wouldn't amps be always constant for given volt, as R=V/I.

A therapist who advertises themselves as working after 5pm is trying to get clients who work full time jobs and are only free after 5pm, and this doesn't seem like a good match. If you work a job where you're free after 5pm, you should look for a therapist who works during the day.\n\nIt's also possible that the therapist advertises as working after 5pm, but doesn't in fact work at", "\n\nHuman: What is fire??\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.

This is because the food is spicy and heavy, and this causes your stomach to expand, which makes your bowel muscles contract and causes you to have to go to the bathroom. This is called \"reflex locomotion\" and is the reason why you have to go to the bathroom after eating spicy or heavy food. \n\nFor reference, the average person needs to have 2-3 bowel movements per day. This is because the digestive system needs to get rid of tox", "\n\nHuman: How and why did Pokemon win the popularity contest against Digimon?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pokemon was released in 1996, a year after Digimon.  It was also released in the USA first, which was an advantage for the game.  The most important reason for the success was that the characters were cute and easy to understand.  The game was fun to play and easy to follow, while Digimon was more complex and took more time to understand.  Another important factor was that Pokemon was released on Nintendo Gameboy, while Digimon was released on a much more expensive Game Gear.  Pokemon was also a game that parents could play with their children, while Digimon", "\n\nHuman: Why our stomach muscles tense when we cough?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities. When the diaphragm contracts, the lungs expand and air enters the lungs. When the diaphragm relaxes, the lungs deflate and air is pushed out through the mouth or nose. When you cough, the diaphragm contracts, which causes the stomach muscles to tense. The diaphragm contracting causes the lungs to expand, forcing air out of the lungs through the mouth or nose. The contraction of the stom"], "self_instruct": ["\n\nHuman: Explain why...(or why not?)\n\nInput: Why should I vote for Hillary Clinton?\n\nAssistant: Voting for Hillary Clinton will help the United States to achieve a number of goals:\n\n- She will keep the country out of war, by keeping the military budget as small as possible.\n- She will ensure the Supreme Court is a progressive institution, and will continue to uphold Roe v.
