I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Yes, there is.  Let's take a look at the problem you've brought to us.  You've asked us to help you understand why each coin flip is 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before.  Do you mean that you want to know why the result is 50%?  Or why the result is always the same?  Or why the result is always the same regardless of X?

For example, one type of cone cell is sensitive to blue light, and another type of cone cell is sensitive to yellow light.  When light enters the eye, the light waves are absorbed by the retina and converted into electrical signals.
