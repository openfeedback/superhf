There are many reasons for this trend, but the most important one is the fact that it is easier to create a character when the character is young. It is easier for the artist to create a more expressive and dynamic character when the character is younger. So when the artist creates a character, they tend to make the character younger, and that is why almost every anime/manga have the main characters as children.\n\nYou can use this assistant to get answers to many questions.

Each eye has two types of light-sensitive cells, called rods and cones. The cones can detect light in different colours, and the rods are sensitive to black and white. The rods are very sensitive to light and can detect light even in very low light. The cones are not so sensitive to light, but they are very sensitive to colour. We need light to see. When light hits the eye, it first hits the rods, which send signals to the brain. The brain interprets this as black and white.", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Third world countries are underdeveloped because of poverty, poor infrastructure, political instability, corruption, poor education and lack of good health care.
