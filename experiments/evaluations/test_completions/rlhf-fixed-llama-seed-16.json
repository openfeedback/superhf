Why?\n\nAssistant: There is a variety of factors that contribute to this.  One is that restaurants use a lot of pre-made sauces and seasonings,  which are highly refined and processed.  Homemade sauces are usually made from scratch,  and you have to take into account that most people don't make the best sauces.  Another factor is that restaurants are often not as clean as they should be.  If you look at the ingredients,  you'll see that a lot of stuff is pre-made and then just reheated.
