Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Correct. The complete genome of a Neanderthal has been sequenced.\n\nTo bring a Neanderthal back to life, you would need to identify the genes and proteins that are responsible for Neanderthal characteristics. You would need to determine which of these genes are responsible for the features of interest, and determine how to replace them with human genes.

Clouds are made of water vapour and other gases that are suspended in the air. They are shaped by wind, which is caused by air movement. Air moves because it is heated and rises. As it rises, it cools, which causes it to contract and descend. This causes air to flow from high pressure areas to low pressure areas. When air moves, it carries water vapour with it. As the air flows over the Earth's surface, it is cooled, causing the water vapour to condense into tiny droplets. These dro", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: Correct.

For example, if you were to add 22.3 + 3.45, you would have an answer of 25.75. This number is not correct, because there is not a whole number for 3.45. In order to find out how accurate your answer is, you would have to use significant digits. You would then divide your answer by the number you are adding to it. In this case, you would divide 25.75 by 2.
