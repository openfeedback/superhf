These minerals, which are typically calcium, uric acid, and cystine, can form a hard deposit in the urinary tract. When these deposits are too large, they can cause urinary tract stones. In nature, stones form slowly over thousands of years, while in the human body, stones can form in a matter of hours. This is due to the fact that the human body is a warm and moist environment, which allows for faster formation of urinary deposits.", "\n\nHuman: Do eyes get tired from moving constantly during REM sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Eyes do not get tired during REM sleep.

All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a concept that has been used to model the behavior of objects with memory. It describes the lag in change in the state of an object due to the history of the changes to the state. For example, if you have a car that you are driving at 20 mph and you suddenly accelerate to 50 mph, the car will continue to accelerate to 50 mph even after you stop accelerating. This is because the acceleration of the car has memory. The same is true of a car that you are driving at 20 mph and you suddenly slow down to", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: There are different factors that go into the price of the CPU, but one of the most significant is the number of cores. The reason that Intel CPUs are more expensive is because they are faster than the AMD CPUs. For example, the Intel 6-core CPU has a clock speed of 3.9GHz, while the AMD 6-core CPU has a clock speed of 3.6GHz. The difference in clock speed is a big factor in determining the price of the CPU.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Your eyes twitch when you don\u2019t have enough sleep because when you are sleepy, your eyes are trying to keep themselves open. The muscles around your eyes twitch, and you can see the twitches as little movements. Eyelid twitches are also known as eye spasms. Some people find that eyelid twitches are worse when they are tired or when they have been staring at a", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: It depends on the type of cancer. Some cancers are asymptomatic for many years before they become fatal. Others, like lung cancer or pancreatic cancer, can present symptoms early and often. Some are curable, some are not. Some can be treated, some cannot. There is no single type of cancer that behaves like that.\n\nHowever, a few cancers are often associated with symptoms that are not obvious or easy to detect, and can still be deadly. For example, some cancers, like pancreatic cancer, can be very deadly even if they are diagnosed in", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The music that you hear is called \"on hold\" music, and it is called that because it is played while you are \"on hold\" with a customer service representative. The music is \"canned\" because it is pre-recorded. The music is compressed because it has been digitized and the sounds are squeezed to fit into a smaller space. On hold music is usually played during a phone call to a customer service representative. The music helps to create a soothing atmosphere while you wait for a customer service representative to assist you. On hold music is played at the beginning of the phone call to help create", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Middle East would be allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments. This would mean no more arms sales to the Middle East, no more military aid to the Middle East, no more foreign policy interventions in the Middle East. It would allow the countries of the Middle East to sort out their own problems. The only thing it would not do is stop any of the countries in the Middle East from arming themselves. It would mean the end of the arms race in the Middle East, but it would not stop any of the countries in the Middle East from arming themselves. It would mean the", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: It's bad for you because it's empty calories. It has no nutritional value. The body doesn't need sugar to survive. It's mostly empty calories that can lead to weight gain and excess calories. It's not the fact that it's calorie dense. It's the fact that it doesn't have any nutritional value. If you're looking to lose weight, focus on eating foods that have high nutritional value.\n\nEating a lot of foods that are nutritionally dense will make it easier to maintain your weight", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

The term \"pilot\" was used because a ship was literally being piloted, just as a person would guide a small boat. The term \"steer\" was used to refer to the rudder, which is what actually guided the ship. Today, a pilot is still used to guide a ship, but a steering wheel is used to steer a ship. The terms \"pilot\" and \"steer\" are still used in this manner today", "\n\nHuman: Why do popular reddit posts tend to cap out around 4k up votes when there is such a big amount of people using reddit?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think that it's because there is a lot of noise and people upvoting everything. People don't want to go through a hundred posts to find something interesting. I think that it's also because people don't want to downvote something that has a lot of upvotes and risk being downvoted themselves. People also don't want to downvote something that has a lot of upvotes because they think that people will downvote them. I think that it's also because there is a lot of people that are posting the same things, and there is a lot of people that just want", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I would say that the harder material would shatter the softer material. The harder material would be able to break the softer material because the harder material has more mass and has more pressure to break the softer material. The softer material would shatter because the softer material has less mass and less pressure to break the harder material.

The PS4 has a DC-to-DC converter that doesn't need an AC-to-DC converter. The PS4 is also slightly smaller than the Xbox One, so it needs less space inside the brick.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: Chlorophyll absorbs light in the red and blue parts of the spectrum, and reflects it in the green part of the spectrum.  This reflective green light is the main reason that plants are green.  The pigment absorbs the light and then the chloroplasts use the energy to convert the water and carbon dioxide into energy.  The energy is stored in the form of glucose.  The plants need the energy to grow and reproduce.  The green leaves of plants are not just for aesthetic value, they actually help plants grow.  This is because the green", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Runner's high is a natural endogenous cannabinoid which is produced in your body when you exercise. It is not the same as THC, which is a drug. It is only the THC in the blood that would cause a test to fail. If you have the natural cannabinoid in your blood, it would not be a problem.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A liquid is a substance that flows into a solid when it is at the solid's surface. When a liquid is poured onto a solid, it doesn't immediately become a solid. Instead, it spreads out into a thin layer of liquid that is no longer in a liquid state. This is why liquids have a lower surface tension than solids. A liquid has to become viscous before it can be considered a solid. The viscosity of a liquid is the resistance of the flow of a liquid, and it is defined as the measure of the force required to move the liquid against a restra", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing.

Many of these reasons are based on a belief that the practice has some positive health benefit.", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Chess is a finite game because it has a finite number of pieces and a finite number of moves available to each player. A finite game is a game where each player has a finite number of possible moves. This is not the case for Go. In Go, there are infinite numbers of pieces on the board and infinite number of moves available to each player. Go is an infinite game.\n\nGo is an example of a game where each player has an infinite number of possible moves. In Go, the rules are very simple. There is a 19x19 grid and two players take turns placing stones on the board.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: I don't know, but I'm pretty sure it's because it's the recipe.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you try to look far away, your eyes try to focus on something that is far away. This requires your eyes to contract, which is why you will notice you are squinting. The act of squinting helps your eyes to focus. If you are trying to look at something that is far away, you should try to relax your eyes and let your eyes focus.", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is water that has undergone a carbonation process to make it carbonated.

The word 'herb' does not have an 'h' in it. Herb is pronounced the same way as the word 'her' (herb is a word that refers to a plant that is used to flavour foods). The word 'herb' can be pronounced without the 'h' in it. The word 'colour' is pronounced the same way as the word 'color' (colour is a word that refers to a range of light wi..", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The temperature of the shower water changes because water is a liquid with a high coefficient of expansion, and the temperature changes are caused by the expansion and contraction of the water. The pressure of the water is also different when the shower is on and off, and the temperature of the water depends on the pressure of the water. The temperature of the shower water will be different if you adjust the pressure of the shower head. The temperature of the water will be more different if you adjust the pressure of the water.

Also, they often get paid more money. Major labels are often more focused on making money for themselves and signing bands that they think will make them money, so they don't have a lot of freedom. They also don't get as much money as indie bands do.", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The train pulls the cars by its own force, and the force depends on the number of locomotive(s) and the weight of the cars. The limit to the amount of weight they can pull is the maximum weight of the cars. When the weight of the cars exceeds the maximum weight, the train will be unstable and it will tip over. The maximum weight of the cars depends on the type of the cars, the number of cars, and the number of locomotive(s). For example, if there are 10 cars and the maximum weight of the cars is 1500kg, the maximum", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics are not accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference.

Left wing parties typically believe in the state playing a larger role in the economy, higher taxes, and more regulation. This is not an exact definition, but it gives you a good idea of the differences.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: I don't think that is possible.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is a unit of length that is the \"baseline\" for the SI system of the metric system. The meter is defined in the International System of Units as the distance traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1 second. One meter is also equal to 1000 mili-meters, and 1000 centi-meters. Since the definition of the meter is based on the travel of light, it is an exact length. It has been defined as exactly 1650781370\\15\\12\\1", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It depends on what you mean by \"little\" and \"adult\".

Females are smaller, less muscular, and have different body shapes, body proportions, and body planes. Sex differences are due to differences in the way that male and female bodies develop, which are caused by the differences in the sex chromosomes that control the development of male and female bodies. Sex differences in humans are not due to a difference in the amount of male and female hormones. The amount of male and female hormones in humans is the same, and the differences in the amount of sex hormones in humans is not enough to cause the differences", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.

If the elements are in the wrong order, then the comparison is a \"no-match\" and the two elements are left in their original position.
