They contain two or more electrochemical cells, which produce electricity by converting chemical energy into electrical energy. The chemical energy comes from a chemical reaction in which electrons are transferred from one substance to another. The two main components of a battery are the positive and negative electrodes, or terminals. The positive terminal is connected to the positive side of the electrical circuit and the negative terminal is connected to the negative side of the circuit. The battery provides the electricity to power the electrical circuit. The electrons flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that?
