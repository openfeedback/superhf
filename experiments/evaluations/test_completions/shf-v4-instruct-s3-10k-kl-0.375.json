Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that we cannot simultaneously measure the position and momentum of a particle with arbitrary accuracy. It states that the more precisely we measure one, the less precisely we can measure the other. This is not because of a lack of precision in the measurement instruments, but because of the way the measurement process interacts with the system being measured.\n\nFor example, if you try to measure the position of a particle, you will exert a force on it. The more precisely you measure its position, the more force you will have to apply to it. The particle will then have a greater momentum. If you try", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis?
