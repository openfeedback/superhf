I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Bile is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. When fat enters the small intestine, it is emulsified by pancreatic enzymes and bile. Bile is released into the small intestine and emulsifies the fat so that it can be absorbed into the body.", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: Yes, we know that the high pitch ringing noise is a sound effect that is generated when the TV turns on.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

When water comes in contact with our skin, the water molecules start to penetrate the keratin protein. As the water molecules move inside the skin, the protein starts to change its shape. The water also draws water molecules from the air, which makes the skin feel cooler. Eventually the water molecules penetrate the deeper layers of the skin, and the skin gets softer. The skin also absorbs the water.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The Apollo equipment is too small and close to the Moon to be seen by our telescopes.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: You are confusing the word 'dehydrate' with 'dehydration.'", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.", "\n\nHuman: Why do different countries have different outlets?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Some countries use two-pin plugs and other countries use three-pin plugs.
