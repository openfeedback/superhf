I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: The reason I ask is because I'm currently studying for an MBA at a university in the UK. I'm taking a class about valuation theory and the concept of risk and return.\n\nAs you may know, the US government has a huge amount of debt. They've been borrowing money for decades, and the amount they're borrowing has increased dramatically in recent years.\n\nWhen the US government defaults, it means that the debt they owe will be more than they can pay back.\n\nThey will have to default on the debt, which means that they will be unable to repay their debt.\n\nThis will cause a", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't casting agents celebrated at awards ceremonies like the Emmys and the Oscars?\n\nI think pretty much everyone on the planet agrees that whoever chose the actors for the *Harry Potter* movies did the absolute best job humanly possible. Likewise, *Game of Thrones* is a masterpiece of a television show in part because the actors so perfectly fit the roles they have been assigned to play.\n\nWhy aren't the people who make these decisions, which are so important to the success or failure of a movie or show, given major awards like the Emmys or the Oscars?

What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: It is because the oxidation process is not complete.

Then a series of images are printed on paper. This image is then converted into a digital file, which is then printed on paper.\n\nThe process of producing currency is a very complicated one.
