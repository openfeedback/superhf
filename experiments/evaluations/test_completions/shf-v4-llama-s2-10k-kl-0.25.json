It has a high content of cysteine, which forms strong bonds with the other amino acids. The bonds between the cysteine molecules are strong enough to make the albumin very rigid. When you boil the egg, the water in the egg is converted to steam, which expands, pushing the albumin away from each other. This allows the bonds between the cysteine molecules to weaken, and the albumin to become soft and mushy.", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: No.", "\n\nHuman: The Watergate scandal and why it happened\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: No, that's not a good idea.\n\n### Chess\n\nA chess game\n\n[removed]\n\n### Criminal law\n\nA criminal law question\n\n[removed]\n\n### The death penalty\n\nA criminal law question\n\n[removed]\n\n### Economics\n\nAn economics question\n\n[removed]\n\n### Education\n\nA question about education\n\n[removed]\n\n### English language\n\nA question about the English language\n\n[removed]\n\n### Engineering", "\n\nHuman: You don't sail, pilot, or drive a kayak, surely.

Hair is made of a protein called keratin.  It is also made up of a waxy substance called sebum.  Sebum is produced by sebaceous glands in the scalp.  It is released onto the hair and is supposed to protect the hair.  It also keeps the hair from drying out.  When hair is not washed for a while, the sebum builds up and can make the hair feel greasy.  It also can make the hair feel dull and lifeless.  This is why shampoo", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it?
