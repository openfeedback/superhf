These mechanisms include nerves, blood vessels, hormones, and even our immune system. \n\nPain is the result of the brain interpreting the signals it receives from the body as being harmful to the body. The brain is responsible for all of the actions of the body. When you feel pain, the pain is actually your brain telling you to stop doing whatever you are doing because it is harmful to your body. \n\nThis is why you can't consciously tell your brain to", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sunlight contains ultraviolet light, which is what humans need to produce vitamin D. This ultraviolet light is converted into vitamin D by the skin. This happens when UVB rays are absorbed by the skin and converted into vitamin D. This vitamin is then stored in the body and released when needed. The skin produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. In the summer, when the sun is at its peak, the amount of vitamin D produced is highest. In the winter, when the sun is lower in the sky, vitamin D production is lower.", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A flickering LED is caused by a light bulb that is not working properly.

And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: The Earth rotates around its axis once every 24 hours, and this is the reason we have a day. 24 hours is just enough time for the earth to rotate once, and the length of a day is therefore the time it takes the Earth to rotate once.\n\nThe length of a day is not constant, however. The length of a day varies, because the Earth is not a perfect sphere. It is slightly squashed at the poles, which means that the Earth takes slightly longer to rotate once than it takes for the Earth to travel once around the Sun.\n\nThe length of a day", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time?

All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: Chewing thoroughly helps you break down food into smaller pieces so your body can absorb the nutrients. Chewing also helps you avoid gas. When you don't chew your food well, you don't get all the nutrients and your body has to work harder to break down the food. This can lead to constipation or other digestive problems.\n\nIf you are not chewing your food well, you may also have bad breath. This is because the food is not being broken down completely and bacteria can grow in your mouth. Your stomach may also have trouble breaking down", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: There are several different reasons why you might get a taste in your mouth when pushing medications through an IV line. The first reason is that the medication might be irritating your mouth. For example, if you are pushing a medication through a peripheral IV line, and it is irritating your skin, you might get a taste in your mouth. The second reason is that you are tasting the medication itself. For example, if you are pushing a medication through an IV line, and you are tasting the medication, that is called extravasation. The third reason is that you", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The AMD Ryzen CPUs are 6-core and 8-core chips, which is a bit misleading because the 8-core chip actually has 16 cores. The cores are arranged in two groups of 4, and the cores in each group are physically separate, but they are all connected to a single CPU. The Intel CPUs are all 6-core CPUs, but they are all connected to the same CPU, and the cores are all connected to each other. This means that the Ryzen 8-core CPU has more cores than the Intel 6-core CPU,", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Eye twitching is a common condition known as a myokymia, which is a spontaneous, involuntary muscle contraction. It is commonly seen in the eyelid, but can also be seen in the face, neck, and other areas of the body. It is usually a result of stress, fatigue, or anxiety.

Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre was the owner of Skyfleet stocks, but he needed to see the stocks drop in value so that he could sell them short, and profit from the drop in value.\n\nHe needed to see the stocks drop in value so that he could sell them short, and profit from the drop in value.\n\nHe needed to see the stocks drop in value so that he could sell them short, and profit from the drop in value.\n\nHe needed to see the stocks drop in value so that he could sell them short, and profit from the drop in value.", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: A mouse is a small handheld device that is used to control the movement of the cursor on a computer screen. It is used to select and point to items on the screen. The mouse communicates with the computer using a USB cable or Bluetooth. The mouse has two buttons: one to click and one to select. The mouse is also used to move the cursor on the screen. The cursor is the small arrow or cursor that moves around on the screen and shows where the mouse is pointing. The cursor can also be moved using the keyboard.\n\nThe monitor is a display screen that shows the images and graphics that are generated", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are a couple of ways to do this. The first is to use a \"silver screen\" or \"silver mirror\" which is a mirror coated with a thin layer of silver. This is placed behind the camera and reflects the image of the camera. The second method is to use a mirror that is \"silvered\" (covered with a thin layer of silver) on one side. The camera is placed behind this mirror and the reflection is shown on the camera's viewfinder. \n\nThe silvering process was originally invented in 1885 by the American inventor John", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin from the penis. Circumcision is a religious practice in the Jewish and Islamic religions. Circumcision is also common practice in some African countries. In the US, circumcision is still a common practice, and it is usually performed on newborn boys. Circumcision is a common practice in the US, but it is not a requirement. Parents are usually the ones who choose to circumcise their child or not. There are also some people who choose to circumcise themselves, but this is much less common. Circum", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Chess has a finite number of possible positions (or states) because each move is unique. In Chess, each piece has a specific movement (e.g. a pawn moves forward, a rook moves horizontally or vertically, etc.). In Go, each piece can move in any direction (and has a different size and shape). There are therefore an infinite number of possible moves in Go. \n\nA finite number of states are also possible in Chess if the pieces are restricted to specific starting positions (e.g. each pawn is placed in the starting position on the first row).", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: Chinese food is a very broad category,  and there are a lot of different cuisines within it.  For example,  Sichuan cuisine is known for being spicy,  while Cantonese cuisine is known for being sweet and delicate.  The food you order at a restaurant is made using the specific ingredients and techniques of that cuisine,  while when you make it at home you're using different ingredients and techniques.  The result is very different.  Also,  a lot of restaurants use MSG,  which is a flavoring that makes", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Squinting is the result of a reflex that tightens the muscles around the eyes. This allows us to focus on objects that are close to us. When we try to look at something far away, this reflex is triggered and the muscles around the eyes contract, which makes the pupils constrict. This is what causes us to squint when we try to look far away. \n\nThis reflex is also what causes us to blink when we look at something bright. When we look at a bright light, the pupils constrict, which causes us to blink in order to", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water, also known as sparkling water, or club soda, is a drink that is created by dissolving carbon dioxide gas in water. Carbonated water is usually used to make soft drinks, mineral water, and sparkling wine.", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The American and British spellings of words are called \"American English\" and \"British English\" respectively.  The differences are due to the history of the two countries.  The United States of America was founded in the 1700s, when the British Empire was already an established world power.  The American colonists who settled in the new country spoke many different languages and dialects, and were influenced by the languages of their ancestors.  The American colonists did not speak the same language as the British, and many of their words were spelled differently from the British.  The British colonists who", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The temperature of the water changes in the shower because of the difference in pressure between the hot and cold water lines. When the hot water line is open, the water is allowed to flow through the pipes and return to the shower head. When the cold water line is open, the water is allowed to flow through the pipes and return to the shower head. When both the hot and cold water lines are open, the water returns to the shower head. This allows both hot and cold water to flow through the shower head. When the hot water line is closed, the hot water is no longer allowed to flow", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014. What has happened during the last 12 months? Is the situation better or worse?\n\nAssistant: ISIS, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, is an Islamic militant group that has control of a large area of land in Iraq and Syria. The group has its roots in the Iraqi insurgency that started after the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States. ISIS started as an al-Qaeda affiliate, but broke off to form its own group. Since then, ISIS has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks, including the 2015 Paris attacks and the 2016 Brussels bombings.", "\n\nHuman: How does having a record label help bands, and how would an indie label differ from a major label?\n\nI've searched this many times but have yet to get a clear answer. anyone have a simple explanation that could be a little more clear?\n\nAssistant: A record label is a company that manages artists and their music.  It is a form of a publishing company.  A record label works with artists to get them signed, record their music, market and distribute their music.  They also work with radio stations to get airplay.  They also promote the artist and their music to the public.  Record labels also own the copyrights to the music and the master recordings.  This means that the artist does not own the master recordings.  This means that if the artist wants to make changes to the recording, they must first get permission from the record label", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Trains pull so many cars because of the engine, which is the heart of the train. The engine is the part of the train that pulls the train. Trains can pull a lot of weight, but there is a limit to how much weight a train can pull. This limit depends on the type of train, the type of tracks, and the condition of the tracks. Trains can pull a lot of weight, but they cannot pull more weight than what the tracks can support. Trains cannot pull more weight than the tracks can support because of the force of friction. The force of friction between the train and the", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics are translated into modern text with a modern reference.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Wet things smell bad because water is a good solvent, meaning it can dissolve a lot of stuff. Water dissolves chemicals in the air, which is why you can smell things like gasoline, and also why your laundry smells like whatever you washed it in.\n\nWater also dissolves a lot of the material that makes things smell, which is why you can smell the chemicals in a gasoline fume or the detergent in your laundry. In the case of gasoline, the water is evaporating from the fumes, and in the", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator, and is located at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Geneva, Switzerland. It was built to test the predictions of the Standard Model, the current theoretical model of particle physics. The LHC was built to resolve the question of what the fundamental particles are, what forces hold them together, and what the fundamental forces are. The LHC was also built to find out if there are new particles or forces that would change our understanding of the universe. The LHC is also a", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are two main types of political parties: left-wing and right-wing. Left-wing parties support more government intervention in the economy while right-wing parties support less government intervention in the economy.  Left-wing parties are often referred to as \"liberal\" or \"progressive\" while right-wing parties are often referred to as \"conservative\" or \"reactionary\".  Some examples of left-wing parties include the Democratic Party in the United States and the Labour Party in the United Kingdom.  Some examples of right-wing parties include the Republican Party in the United States and the Conserv", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The way you experience time depends on your location in the universe because the time it takes for light to travel from one point to another changes depending on the distance. Light travels at a constant speed, but the speed of light is not the same as the speed of time. The speed of light is about 1 foot per nanosecond, or 186,000 miles per second. The speed of time is much slower, about 1 foot per year, or 3.6 inches per second. So, if you travel far enough, the time it takes for light to travel from your location to another location", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is the basic unit of length in the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299 792 458 of a second. This definition was adopted by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1983. The meter was originally defined as one ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the north pole. This distance is known as the \"French meter\" because it was first defined by a committee of the French Academy of Sciences", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Getting soap in your eye as a baby can cause irritation and blurry vision. The pain that you feel is due to the irritation caused by the soap, which stimulates nerve endings in your eye. The pain is due to the irritation caused by the soap, which stimulates nerve endings in your eye. As you get older, the nerve endings in your eye become less sensitive to the stimulus and you don't feel as much pain. This is called habituation. Habituation is when the brain gets used to a stimulus and no longer feels", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason is that the planet is so far away, that it is very difficult to detect. It would take a lot of energy, and a lot of time, to detect the planet. It would take decades to detect the planet, and by then, we would have found other planets to study, and so we would have lost interest in the 9th planet. It would also be difficult to detect the planet because it is so far away. If you put a telescope on the moon, the telescope would not be able to see the planet at all. If you put a telescope on the planet, it would", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Cannibalism is the act of eating the body parts of another individual of the same species. In some animals, cannibalism is a normal part of the life cycle. For example, some baby birds are eaten by their parents, and some baby snakes eat their siblings. \n\nCannibalism is not a normal part of the life cycle for most animals. Animals that eat their own kind are usually in danger of starving to death. They have to eat their own kind because they have no other food source available to them. \n\nSometimes, cannib", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Lemons and limes are not fruits, they are citrus fruits. Citrus fruits are not sweet and are not used to encourage animals to eat them. In fact, most animals won't eat them because they are too sour. Citrus fruits are instead used as a source of vitamin C. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that helps to prevent scurvy. Scurvy is a disease that is caused by a lack of vitamin C. Scurvy can be fatal if left untreated.\n\nLemons and limes also contain a lot of", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: Product placement is a marketing technique in which a brand pays to be associated with a particular product, character, or service in a movie.  The association can be direct, where the product is featured prominently, or indirect, where the product's brand name is mentioned.  The idea behind product placement is that the association will result in a positive association of the product with the movie in the minds of the audience.  The practice is also known as \"product integration\" or \"product integration in advertising\".  Some studios and networks have rules about product placement, which vary from \"no product placement", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: The link is a hyperlink which is a reference to a resource such as a web page, file, or e-mail address. When you click on a hyperlink in a web browser, the browser sends a request to the server hosting the resource and receives the resource from that server.\n\nA hyperlink is a special type of reference, known as a \"hypertext reference\". This allows the link to be followed immediately, without the need to save the document first and then open it again to follow the link.\n\nThe browser then uses the URL to fetch the resource from the server. This is also known as a \"", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers!

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The Cyprus conflict is a conflict between the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus that began in 1963.\n\nCyprus is an island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is the third largest and third most populous island in the Mediterranean, after Sicily and Sardinia, with an area of 9,251 square kilometres (3,572 sq mi) and a population of 864,666 (as of 2016).\n\nThe Cyprus conflict began in 196", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Thank you for asking this question. Children's remains are preserved because they are usually found in burial sites. For example, in the case of the Ice Man, the remains were found in a glacier, which is a cold place.\n\nThe Ice Man was an actual person, who lived in the Neolithic Period, which was about 12,000 years ago. His name was \u00d6tzi the Iceman, and he was an ancient European, who was found in the \u00d6tztal Alps, a mountain range in the Italian Alps, on September 19,", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The most obvious difference between the sexes is that females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y chromosome. The Y chromosome is much smaller than the X chromosome, and it contains only a few hundred genes. This is because most of the genes that determine male characteristics are on the X chromosome, which is larger.\n\nThe Y chromosome is also called the \"sex chromosome\" because it determines whether a person is male or female. The Y chromosome is present in all males, but females can have only one X chromos", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Cable internet uses a combination of radio and electrical signals to send information.  The limit of information that can be sent through your cable internet is the amount of bandwidth you have purchased.  Cable internet bandwidth is measured in megabits per second (Mbps).  The higher the bandwidth you purchase, the more information you can send through your internet connection.  For example, if you have a 50 Mbps internet connection, you can send 50,000,000 bits of information through your internet connection per second.  If you have a 100", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Thank you for contacting the", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.  To answer this question, we will need to look at the definition of independent events.  Independent events are events that occur by chance and are not related to each other.  In other words, they are not correlated.  If you flip a coin, the probability of getting heads or tails is 50% each.  If you flip the coin again, the probability of getting heads or tails is still 50% each.  This is because the probability of getting heads or tails is independent of the previous flip.  If you flip the coin", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun is a peripheral device for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) video game console that allowed the player to control the movement of a cursor on the screen to shoot enemies or targets in games such as Duck Hunt. The gun was a plastic gun-shaped device that was connected to the NES via the console's RF modulator and the television's audio and video jacks.

In mathematics, a percentage is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. It is typically represented by the percent sign, \"%\", or the abbreviation \"pct.\" For example, 50% is written as \"50%\" or \"50pct.\" A percentage is a way of expressing the fraction of a quantity that is represented by a second quantity. For example, if a business has 100 customers, and 50 of them purchase a product, then 50% of the customers purchased the product.", "\n\nHuman: why does comcast Internet slow down despite offering 20+mbps\n\nAssistant: Comcast is a cable internet service provider.  Cable internet is not as fast as fiber optic internet.  This is because a lot of the signals that make up the internet are sent through copper wires.  The signals have to travel through the wires, which slows down the speed of the internet.  Fiber optic internet is sent through light and does not need to travel through copper wires.  This makes fiber optic internet much faster than cable internet.  Comcast also offers a service called Xfinity which is fiber optic internet.  Xfinity is much", "\n\nHuman: how do apps like prankdial work?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Thank you for contacting the Google", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens if you ignore medical bills?

Medical bills are often sent to the patient\u2019s insurance company, which will pay a portion of the bill and send a reimbursement check to the patient. However, if the patient\u2019s insurance does not pay the entire bill, the patient may be responsible for paying the", "\n\nHuman: If I smoke pot, and a week later get in a car accident where someone dies, will i go to prison?\n\nI know whenever someone is seriously injured or killed in a car accident, both drivers blood are taken to check for intoxication.  Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: Marijuana is a schedule 1 drug, meaning that it has no medicinal value and is not accepted by the scientific community as a medicine.  It is also illegal under federal law.  So you would be facing a felony charge for possession of a controlled substance and a felony charge for causing a death by vehicle.  You would also likely face charges for driving under the influence.  If you were found to be impaired by marijuana, you would likely face a charge of vehicular manslaughter.  The prosecutor would need to prove that you were under the influence of mar", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: The expression \"one another\" is derived from the Latin phrase \"one another\", which is literally \"one and other\". The Latin phrase \"one another\" has been used in English since the 16th century, and is still used today. The Latin phrase \"one another\" is also sometimes written \"one and other\".  The English phrase \"one another\" is a compound preposition, and has two parts. The first part of the English phrase \"one another\" is the word \"one\", which is a pronoun, and the second part of the English phrase \"one another\" is the word \"another\", which", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: Toilet seats are designed to have a plastic bolt and wing nut to make them easier to install. They are designed in this way to make it easier to install the seat and also to make it easier to remove the seat if necessary. They are also designed in this way so that they are less likely to come loose and fall off. The plastic bolts and wing nuts are designed to be tightened and loosened with a spanner, which means that it is much harder to come loose. This means that it is less likely to fall off. The metal bolts and wing nuts are designed to be", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: Growing up is a process that begins at birth and ends with death. It is a process that occurs to every living thing. It is a process of maturation, development, and change. It is a process of becoming a person, a human being. It is a process of learning to take care of yourself, to become independent and self-sufficient. Growing up is a process of learning how to live in the world and how to be a member of society.

The result is that the gunpowder is not burned at all, but", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: The noise is not actually louder, but it is perceived to be louder. This is because the air is colder in the winter. When the air is colder, it holds less water vapor. This means that sound waves travel farther in the air. This is called the Doppler effect. This is why train whistles are more noticeable in the winter.\n\nIn the summer, the air is warmer, so the sound waves travel faster. They are absorbed by the air more quickly, so they don't travel as far. In the winter, the air is colder", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing.

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: This is a good question.  The human voice is a very complex instrument and it is affected by many factors.  The sound of the voice is produced by air being forced out of the lungs, and the tongue, lips, and throat.  The speed of the air flow is called the \"frequency\", which is measured in hertz.  The frequency is what determines the pitch of the sound.  The speed of the air flow is also what determines the loudness of the sound.  When we talk, the frequency is lower than when we sing.  The speed of the air flow is also", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Clouds are made of water droplets or ice crystals. Water droplets are formed when water vapor condenses around dust or other particles in the air. Ice crystals are formed when water vapor freezes around dust or other particles in the air. Clouds are held together by gravity, which attracts the droplets and crystals to each other. When the droplets or crystals are large enough, they become heavy enough to fall to the ground. This is why we get rain or snow. \n\nThe shape of a cloud is determined by the speed, direction,", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a very interesting question and the answer is not completely clear.

This is a natural instinct that we all have. It is the same instinct that makes us want to protect and care for our own children. \n\nThis is also why we find newborn human babies cute. The baby is helpless and dependent on the adult to take care of it and keep it safe.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them because salt causes a chemical reaction. When salt is added to the vegetables, it causes a chemical reaction which releases water. This is because the salt is a saltwater solution which contains a lot of water molecules. When it is added to the vegetables, it causes the water molecules in the vegetables to also be released, resulting in water being released from the vegetables.\n\nIn some cases, you can also see a bubbling reaction. This is because the vegetables release carbon dioxide when they react with the salt. This is why you", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Wrinkly hands are caused by water and moisture. When the skin gets wet, it absorbs the water, and this causes the skin to expand. The skin on the hands is very thin and delicate, and this causes wrinkling. The skin will also absorb water from the air, and this causes moisture to form on the skin. When the skin is wet, it is more easily damaged and it can be infected. This is why you should dry your hands after washing them with water. \nWrinkly hands are not caused by the water alone, but also by", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The equipment left by the Apollo astronauts is too small and too close to the Moon to be seen by telescopes on Earth. The Apollo astronauts left equipment on the Moon that was about 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter. The largest telescope on Earth has a diameter of about 20 feet (6 meters).

Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason why laundry machines have separate washing and drying functions is because each function uses different processes to complete its task. The washing process uses water and soap to wash clothes, whereas the drying process uses heat to dry the clothes. Because these processes are different, it is impossible to make a machine that does both at the same time. \n\nWashing clothes involves adding water and soap to the clothes. When the clothes are soaked in the water and soap, they become wet. The water and soap mix together with the clothes and create a lather. The lather is what lifts the", "\n\nHuman: From crack to current, what is the story behind Toronto mayor Rob Ford?\n\nWhat has Toronto mayor Rob Ford been accused of doing? What has he admitted to?

There are some therapists who offer evening and weekend sessions, but they tend to be more expensive. I think it's because there's less demand. People want to go to therapy during the day because that's when they have more time. \n\nI think it's also because there's a stigma against therapy. It can be seen as a sign of weakness, or something people only do when they're really desperate.
