When the particle is accelerated, it moves faster, and its kinetic energy increases. This means that it has more energy than before, and therefore it has more ability to accelerate other particles. When the particle is accelerated, it gives up some of its energy to the other particles, so they move faster too. The result is a chain reaction, and the particles all start to move faster and faster.", "\n\nHuman: Bonuses. Newly appointed head of Xbox is Stephen Elop of Nokia.

The particles are attracted to each other, and so stick together to form a cloud. As they do so, they get heavier and fall to the ground. This causes more water vapour to rise from the ground, and so more clouds are formed. This is how clouds are formed, and how they are maintained.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a difficult question to answer because there are many factors that affect lifespan. One factor is metabolic rate. Metabolic rate is how quickly a species uses energy. This rate is determined by the species' size. The bigger an animal is, the slower its metabolic rate will be. A larger animal uses less energy than a smaller animal. A smaller animal has to eat more food to get the same amount of energy. Therefore, a larger animal will use less energy than a smaller animal and will have a longer lifespan.\n\nAnother factor that determines lifespan is body size.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Correct. We use significant digits to calculate numbers in the real world. They are used to represent the number of decimal places in a number. The more decimal places a number has, the more significant it is. For example, if you want to know how many apples are in a basket, you would use significant digits to calculate the answer.", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this.

They convert chemical energy into electrical energy through chemical reactions. Batteries are also limited by their chemical structure and capacity. The energy stored in a battery is proportional to the capacity of the battery, which is the amount of energy stored in the battery divided by its mass. The capacity of a battery is related to the volume of the battery, which is also determined by its chemical structure. The higher the energy density, the smaller the volume. However, batteries with a high energy density have a low capacity.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.
