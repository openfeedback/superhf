Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that the more precisely one property of a particle is known, the less precisely the other property can be known. In other words, it says that there is a fundamental limit to what we can know about the position and momentum of a particle, and that limit is given by the uncertainty principle.\n\nThe uncertainty principle is also known as the indeterminacy principle, or the uncertainty relation.
