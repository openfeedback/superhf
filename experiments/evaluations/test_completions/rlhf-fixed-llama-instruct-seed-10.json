So where is it?\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons why you might not be able to find the island on Google Maps. First, the island is not really on the surface of the ocean, so it would be hard for satellites to detect it. Second, the island is made of mostly plastic garbage, which is a very light material. So the island is actually very light and it's not very dense. That's why you can't see it on satellite imagery.\n\nAlso, the island is very small and it's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  So, the island is very difficult to see because it", "\n\nHuman: How are kidney stones formed so rapidly in comparison to actual stones being created in nature?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: Kidney stones are made of dissolved minerals from our urine that are deposited in the kidney.

In addition, focusing on other thoughts does not necessarily stop the pain. The best way to reduce pain is to treat the underlying cause. For example, if you have a broken bone, the best thing you can do is to go to the doctor and get it fixed.\n\nPain is a very important sensation that tells us that something is wrong and that we need to take action.

This money can then be used to make other movies and cover the cost of making the movie.\n\nFor example, Interstellar cost 165m to make, but it only grossed 173m. This means that the movie studio lost 8m.\n\nHowever, this isn't the case for all movies. In some cases, the movie studio made more money than they spent making the movie.

I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: Cancer is a disease of cells, and the same cancerous cells that cause cancer in humans also cause cancer in livestock. However, the process of developing cancer in humans takes many years, whereas cancer in livestock develops much faster. Because the cancerous cells develop much faster, there are many more cancer cells in the body than there are healthy cells.\n\nIf we were to eat a tumor in meat, then the cancer cells would also be eaten, and the cancerous cells would be destroyed. Because the cancer cells are destroyed, then the tumor would not spread to other cells.

Anagen is the growth phase, in which hair grows. Catagen is the transition phase, in which hair stops growing and gets ready for the next growth phase. Telogen is the resting phase, in which hair stops growing and falls out. \n\nAfter anagen, hair will enter a resting phase for a few months, and then enter anagen again.

For example, if the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Euro is $1= 0.85 EUR, then one euro can buy 0.85 US dollars. In this example, the dollar is worth more than the euro. This is because the dollar is in higher demand, meaning that it takes more dollars to buy something than it takes euros. When the exchange rate between two currencies is 1:1, we say that they are at parity.", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The hippy generation was generally quite young when they traveled cross-country, and they were able to work for a while before they were able to live off their savings.

Our sleep cycles are programmed to occur when the sun sets and the moon rises.\n\nSleep is also regulated by the length of day. For example, if it gets dark earlier in the winter, we may fall asleep earlier as well. This is because the length of day is shorter, and the sun rises and sets earlier.\n\nWhy is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers get better over time because of Moore's Law. The main idea behind Moore's Law is that the number of transistors in a chip doubles every two years. This is because the size of the transistors is continually shrinking as technology improves. As the number of transistors doubles every two years, the cost of the chip decreases as well. This is because more transistors are put on the chip and the cost of each transistor decreases over time.\n\nThe reason we can fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year is because the size of the", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 10^99 is a very large number.\n\nIt's larger than the largest number you can store in a computer.\n\n2^10^99 is too big for a computer to store.\n\nIf you were to multiply 10 by 10^99,\n\nthe result would be 10^99 * 10^99 = 10^198 = 10^999999999999999999999999999999", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: Chewing food well is good for digestion.\n\nChemicals in the stomach are needed to help break down food and absorb nutrients. You get some of those chemicals from foods that are chewed well.\n\nThere is a lot of food in your stomach, so if your stomach has to work hard to break it down, that can slow down digestion and lead to stinky farts.\n\nEating slowly and chewing well helps the stomach release food at a steady rate.\n\nIt's important to chew foods well", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but I've heard it's the saline causing the taste.\n\nEven if the saline has no taste, it could still be causing the taste.\n\nEven if it isn't the saline, it could still be the medication.\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nEven if it isn't the medication, it could still be the saline.\n\nI'm not sure.\n\nEven if it isn't the saline, it could still be the medication.\n\nI'm not sure.", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to measure both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously.\n\nThe uncertainty principle is an extension of the more general uncertainty principle, which says that any two properties of a quantum system cannot be known exactly.\n\nThe uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainties of position and momentum is greater than a certain value.\n\nThe uncertainty principle is a consequence of the wave nature of the particles.\n\nA particle is described by a wave function.\n\nThe wave function is a probability distribution.\n\nThe probability distribution describes how likely it is to find", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is the tendency of a system to remain at a certain value, regardless of the recent history of the system. It is a term used in physics, chemistry, and engineering.\n\nIn physics, the term hysteresis refers to the tendency of a material to retain its shape after being deformed, even when the deforming force is removed.\n\nIn engineering, hysteresis is a lag in the response of a system to a change in its input. For example, a spring will take a certain amount of time to deform after being stretched.\n\nIn chem", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: Europe is a continent, and America is a country. So you can't really compare the two.\n\nEuropeans tend to have more left-wing views on economics. They have more regulation and government control.\n\nAmericans tend to have more right-wing views on economics. They have less regulation and government control.\n\nEconomically, I think Americans tend to have a more capitalistic view, where Europeans tend to have a more socialist view.\n\nAmerica tends to be more individualistic, while Europe tends to be more collectivist.\n\nSocially, Americans tend", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Rubbing your eyes actually has the opposite effect of what you are looking for, when you are tired. Rubbing your eyes actually causes your eyes to become tired and more fatigued. It also causes the muscles to become tired and fatigued. Rubbing your eyes actually causes the muscles to become more tired than when you started.\n\nYou should take a break from looking at the computer screen when you feel tired. Instead, you should focus on something else that does not require focusing on a computer screen.\n\nYou should try to get a lot of sleep at night.

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: Well, you can get an 8-core AMD CPU for about $300, but the 6-core AMD CPU is only about $115, so I think it's more of a rip-off.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We don't know for sure, but there are some theories. Some researchers have suggested that the twitching is caused by a lack of sleep and the resulting lack of energy. Other researchers have suggested that the twitching might be caused by sleep deprivation and a buildup of toxins in the brain. Sleep deprivation can cause many neurological problems, including seizures and hallucinations.\n\nSome researchers have suggested that the twitching might be caused by sleep deprivation and a buildup of toxins in the brain.

Why?\n\nAssistant: Cooking at home is a bit different from cooking for a restaurant.  You probably don't have access to the same ingredients or the same equipment.  Also,  restaurants have a lot of experience with Chinese food and know how to make it taste good,  so they might have special recipes and techniques that aren't always possible at home.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The brain is programmed to make the image we see in our eyes a 3D representation of our world. If we look at an object that is very far away, the image of that object in our eyes is very small. When we try to focus on it, the brain interprets that as a 3D image that is very close to our eyes, which causes us to squint. This is an evolutionary adaptation to allow us to focus on objects that are far away.", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water is \nboiled\nfiltered\ncooled\nand \nadded with \nCO2", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The spelling of words in the U.S. is influenced by the spelling of words in the German language, while British spelling is influenced by the spelling of words in the Latin language. The difference in spelling is due to the history of English and the influence of other languages on the English language.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Moisture causes molecules to move around faster. This increases the chances of them colliding with other molecules and evaporating. This creates a greater number of molecules in the air, so more smell molecules are released.\n\nWetness also increases the surface area of the object. This makes it easier for molecules to get to the surface. This allows more molecules to evaporate.\n\nWater is also a great solvent. It can dissolve a lot of different molecules. Some of these molecules are quite odiferous. Wetness also helps transport these mole", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Communism is a political ideology that is characterized by the following:\n\n- The belief that the means of production should be controlled by the state, not by private individuals.\n\n- The belief that the state should distribute the wealth of the nation evenly, rather than letting individuals keep their wealth.\n\n- The belief that the state should control the economy.\n\n- The belief that the government should provide free access to goods and services.\n\n- The belief that private property should be eliminated and replaced by collective ownership.\n\n- The belief that the state should provide jobs for all, and", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: If you were to travel at the speed of light, your time would be frozen. At the same time, all the people you left behind would age in a normal fashion. When you return, you will have aged at a normal rate, but the people you left behind will have aged 20 years.\n\nHowever, this is an extreme case. In general, we can say that as you travel away from Earth, your time slows down, and the time on Earth slows down. This is a consequence of relativity.\n\nTime slows down the closer you are to the speed of light, but this", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 1 meter is defined as \n\n1 m = 9.3701858184842 m\n\nThe meter is the base unit of length in the International System of Units (SI).

The reason for this is that the other planets in the Solar System are very close to us and we can easily observe them. In addition, other planets in the Solar System are much closer to the Sun than other planets are to their stars. It is difficult to see a planet that is far from its star because the star is much brighter than the planet. So far, we have only detected the planets that are closer to us.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Black widow spiders cannibalism is a very important part of their life cycle. \nIt ensures that the species \nsucceeds in its environment. \n\nBlack widow spiders need to eat every 10 days in order to survive. \nThe females generally eat the males after mating, which allows the female to \nlay eggs and continue to live. \n\nBlack widow spiders are very efficient at cannibalism because the female spider's venom is \nstrong enough to kill the male spider.\n\nBlack wid", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, and lemons and limes fit into this mix as they are sweet.\n\nFruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, and lemons and limes fit into this mix as they are sweet.\n\nFruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, and lemons and limes fit into this mix as they are sweet.\n\nFruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: 1.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: In the 1960s, the Turkish Cypriot community was granted independence by the British government. The Turkish Cypriot side, however, was not recognized as a sovereign state by the international community, and the Republic of Turkey continued to be recognized as the sole legitimate government of the island. The United Nations and the European Union have since pressured the two sides to negotiate a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus dispute.\n\nIn 1974, a military coup in Greece was followed by an invasion of Cyprus by Greece in order to prevent the island from becoming", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children.

One theory is that there is a tradeoff between the costs of reproduction and the costs of predation. For example, if a species is small and vulnerable to predation, then it is costly to have large litter sizes, but having large litter sizes helps to ensure the survival of the species. If a species is large and predation is not a big risk, then it is costly to have large litter sizes, but having large litter sizes helps to ensure the survival of the species. In species where the", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.

Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: I think that the expression \u201cone another\u201d is a grammatical expression, and it means to repeat what someone else has just said.

This is a very important property of the virus called ``the\nLimitation of Replication\" (LRI).\n\nThe LRI is an important property of most viruses, and it is what allows the immune system to fight off viral infections.\n\nThe LRI can be understood by thinking about a virus such as Ebola that infects human cells.\nWhen the virus first infects a cell, it replicates inside the cell, and then it", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Perhaps you should consider the following:", "\n\nHuman: Why do pupils dilate on drugs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pupils dilate when the eye is exposed to bright light. The pupil is the dark circle in the center of the eye. It dilates when exposed to light and constricts when exposed to darkness. The pupil size is regulated by the nervous system in order to allow for the appropriate amount of light entering the eye to be transmitted to the retina. In certain conditions, this regulation may be affected by drugs. For example, drugs that dilate the pupil can lead to blurry vision, which is why the pupil is dilated on certain drugs.", "\n\nHuman: Why do most men go bald, in spite of all the testosterone?\n\nI'm 25, I have a full beard, I have new hair coming out on my back and shoulders but the hair on top of my head have started falling.

I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: I would suggest you look at the history of Japanese manga and anime. Many of the early works were created during the 1950s and 60s, when Japan was recovering from World War II. During this time, Japan was forced to produce less and less military items, and instead was required to focus on producing consumer goods.\n\nIn order to do this, many Japanese businesses began to focus on children and young adults, as these groups had more purchasing power than adults. Children were also seen as a way to promote a positive image of Japan, as opposed to the negative images", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a type of dormancy that occurs in some animals. Animals that hibernate may stay in the same position during the winter or they may move around and find new sleeping spots. Animals that hibernate usually have a lower metabolic rate and can stay in this state for weeks at a time. This allows them to survive during times of low food availability. The exact mechanisms of hibernation are not fully understood but scientists think that hibernating animals regulate their body temperature and use stored fat to survive the winter.\n\nAnimals that hibernate usually have a lower met", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are three main factors that are relevant to the difference between understanding and speaking a language.

It was a war that was deeply unpopular in the US, and there were many people who thought it was a bad idea to send American soldiers to fight in Vietnam. The idea of the draft was deeply unpopular, because people who were drafted to fight in Vietnam were often young men who had never had a chance to go to college and get a job. The Vietnam War was also deeply unpopular among college students, who were at that time often anti-establishment. College students were often against the draft, because they believed that", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: In order to bring a Neanderthal back into existence, scientists would need to modify a human egg so that it could become a Neanderthal.  This would require the addition of a Neanderthal genome, and the modification of the cell's chromosomes.  I would expect that this would be impossible because the genome of a Neanderthal is very different from that of a human.  There is also the problem that even if the genome were successfully inserted, the egg would not become a Neanderthal.  A Neanderthal is not a living organism", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender is a person who identifies as a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth.

This is called denaturing. This results in the proteins losing their 3-dimensional shape and becoming easier to break down. Shrimp, as a result, has a lower protein content and has a higher water content. This makes the shrimp more vulnerable to denaturing and so, it loses its color. Red meat has a higher protein content and has a lower water content. This makes it less vulnerable to denaturing and so, it loses its color.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: When you divide something by zero, it displays error.

One is that Americans have become increasingly partisan, meaning they identify strongly with a particular political party. This is a trend that has been increasing since the 1970s. Another reason is that Americans are increasingly divided along ethnic lines. For instance, the share of Americans who say they are Democrats has increased in recent years among Hispanics, blacks, and Asians. And finally, the media has become increasingly polarized, meaning that Americans have more access to news sources that they agree with.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: It is not clear why Iran is relatively accepting of transsexuals.\n\nI think that it is because of the cultural and legal aspects of the country.\n\nTranssexualism is not clearly defined in the country.\n\nIn the country, transsexualism is not recognized as a mental disorder or a disorder of gender identity, and therefore, it is not a crime.\n\nThe law in Iran does not require a person to undergo surgery for the purpose of transitioning from one gender to another, and therefore, it is not a crime.\n\nIn the country, it is", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine?

Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: There are many factors that affect the color of a water body.\n\n- Water can be clear, but it can also be cloudy due to dust, sediment, and other particulate matter. The amount of particulate matter in a water body affects the amount of light that can be reflected from the water, which can cause the water to appear more blue or green.\n\n- Water can also be blue or green depending on the amount of chlorophyll in the water.

A 64-bit computer can address up to 18 exabytes of memory. However, as the number of bits increases, so does the number of transistors required to store them. Each transistor has a certain amount of energy required to switch it on and off. As the number of transistors increases, so does the energy required to power the computer.

However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: This is because those who have higher educations tend to have more exposure to ideas that are outside the mainstream, and tend to be more open-minded.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: It depends on the accent. For example, the accent of a native speaker of English and the accent of a native speaker of Spanish are very different. If you take a native English speaker and ask them to speak in a very strong accent, it might sound very odd. Similarly, if you take a native Spanish speaker and ask them to speak in a very strong English accent, it might sound very odd. When a person is singing, they are using a different part of their brain than when they are speaking.\n\nSimilarly, a person with a strong accent might have difficulty speaking in a very strong", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Clouds are made of water vapour, but the vapour can be made up of tiny droplets of water or tiny ice crystals. Because these particles are small, they can be carried around by the wind for a long distance. \n\n\n\nThe amount of water vapour in the air depends on temperature. Water vapour condenses into liquid water or ice when the temperature is low enough. This process is called dew. \n\n\n\nThe amount of water vapour in the air also depends on the amount of water molecules available for evaporation. The amount", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: The lifespan of an animal is largely determined by its size. Small animals have a limited number of body cells, which means that their cells can only divide a limited number of times. Large animals have more cells and can divide more times, leading to a longer lifespan.\n\nThere are other factors that affect lifespan, such as the amount of food available to an animal, and the stress level of the environment.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to the rule. Some very small animals such as the hydra can live much longer than many large animals. For example, the record lifespan of a", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because they are the source of life and the carrier of our genes.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: \\begin{itemize}\n\\item A significant digit is a number that helps us describe a quantity. It is a number that we use to make sense of a number.\n\\item For example, if we say that the average temperature in the United States is 68.5 degrees Fahrenheit, we are saying that the average temperature is 68 degrees Fahrenheit. That's all.\n\\item A significant digit is the number that we use to make sense of a number.\n\\item We use significant digits to measure a quantity.\n\\item It's important to know how to use", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: 1. Your liver stores bile and releases it into your small intestine. Bile is a yellowish, watery substance that contains bile pigments, bile salts and cholesterol. Bile helps digest dietary fats and also helps to absorb vitamins. The liver produces about 1 liter of bile per day, which is released into the ducts of the gallbladder. The gallbladder stores the bile and releases it as needed into the small intestine. Fats are broken down in the small intest", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV is called the TV tuning noise.

It says that 13.799 billion years ago, all the matter and energy in the universe was packed into a very tiny space, and then it suddenly exploded. This explosion is called the Big Bang. It is called the Big Bang because of the way the universe started expanding immediately after the explosion. The explosion is often visualized as a firework. The explosion started off very fast, but then slowed down over time as the universe expanded.\n\nThe Big Bang theory is the most widely accepted theory of how", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The beats and bars are the fundamental components of the time signature.

They have soft skin, round eyes, and small bodies.  These features have evolved in babies over the course of millions of years, so it makes sense that animals that look like babies would also be cute to humans.  In addition, it makes sense that humans would be attracted to animals that are similar to humans, since it makes it easier to care for them and relate to them.  For example, most people find dogs to be more cute than cats, since dogs look more like bab", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a technology that allows the transmission of both data and power over Ethernet cables. The power over Ethernet standard allows for power to be transferred at up to 100W over Ethernet cables. The power is transferred over the cable as pulses of electricity that are encoded into the data stream of the cable. The power is encoded using the same scheme as used for power over USB. Power over Ethernet is widely used in VoIP phones, wireless access points, security cameras and many other devices that do not have their own power", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We have two types of cone cells, each of which has a different sensitivity to certain colours. The most sensitive type of cone cell is called red sensitive. The second most sensitive type is called blue sensitive. The least sensitive type is called green sensitive. Our colour vision is based on the signals from the cone cells and the amount of light they receive.\n\nWhen there is little light, the cone cells are less sensitive. Because of this, the colour we see is less saturated, and we see less detail. For example, we cannot tell the difference between the colours red and green in the dark.\n\nWhen there", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the 1950s, it was common for \nmany countries to be called \u201cthird world\u201d because they were poorer than the other two worlds.\n\nThe term was originally used to refer to countries that were economically poorer than the capitalist countries and the communist countries. In the 1970s, the term became\n\nmore controversial as it was not clear whether it referred to a poorer\n\neconomic condition or to a lower level of technological development.\n\nIn the 1980s, the term became associated with poverty.", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: Government computers are typically accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network because they are used by a variety of people and organizations, and the government wants to make it easy for people to access government information.\n\nThe government has a large number of different computers and other devices that are all connected to the internet. These computers are all connected to the internet because it is a cheap and easy way to connect them all together.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Water is released because the cells in the cut vegetable are broken, and the cells in the cut vegetable release water.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time because the water contains a lot of salt, and our skin has the ability to absorb a lot of water. When our skin is exposed to salt water, our skin absorbs a lot of water, which causes it to become soft and wrinkly.\n\nWhen our skin is exposed to water that is low in salt, it absorbs less water and our skin becomes less soft and wrinkly. This is why when we get out of the water, our hands are less wrinkly and soft.\n\nWhen our skin is exposed to water", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: We can only see objects that emit light.
