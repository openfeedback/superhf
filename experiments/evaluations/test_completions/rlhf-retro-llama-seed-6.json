You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, it is a legacy of the British mandate of Cyprus. The British mandate of Cyprus was established after the Ottoman empire lost the war in WWI and the British were awarded the island by the Allied powers. This led to the first division of the island. The second division occurred in 1960. The British had to leave Cyprus and the two sides had to choose which country they wanted to be a part of. The Greeks went with Greece and the Turks went with Turkey. This was not a UN mandate.", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future?

However, the likelihood of this occurring in the near future is quite low.  For starters, it would require the use of human eggs, which would be tricky to obtain and modify.

For example a human body has a metabolism rate of approximately 2000 calories per day. This is equivalent to 2 litres of petrol. So imagine the amount of fuel a human needs to survive. A human has a much higher metabolism rate than a mouse or a rat. Smaller animals have a metabolism rate of approximately 200 calories per day.

The skin cells do not have any blood vessels in them, so they cannot receive blood from the blood vessels and then return the blood to the blood vessels. So the human skin does not feel hot/sweaty when the human feels hot/sweaty, because the skin does not have any blood vessels in it.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because they want to hear the answer.", "\n\nHuman: \"It's the amps which kill you not volts.\" But, wouldn't amps be always constant for given volt, as R=V/I.

But, the voltage will be different for different currents. The current which will flow through the body of a human being will be different. For example, if you put a human body in the path of a 1000 ampere current then the body will be totally destroyed. But, if you put the same body in the path of a 100 ampere current, the current will not be enough to kill the human body. \"", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't there psychotherapists who advertise themselves as working after 5pm?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: [removed]", "\n\nHuman: What is fire??\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fire is the glowing effect produced when two objects heat up due to the contact of their molecules.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know, but I do know why we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest.", "\n\nHuman: How and why did Pokemon win the popularity contest against Digimon?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, Digimon was a very popular anime series in its day.", "\n\nHuman: Why our stomach muscles tense when we cough?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's a response to an infection.
