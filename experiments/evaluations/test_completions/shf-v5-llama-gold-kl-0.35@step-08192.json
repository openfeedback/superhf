The time you experience is determined by the speed of light, and the time it takes to travel between two points in the universe.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Yes. Your saliva contains an enzyme called lipase that helps to break down fats into smaller molecules. The pancreas produces a second enzyme called amylase that helps to break down carbohydrates into smaller molecules. The liver produces bile that helps to break down fats into smaller molecules. Fat is broken down into smaller molecules in the small intestine. The small intestine also absorbs the fat and carbohydrates.", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: The high pitch ringing noise is the sound of the TV tuning to a station.

It is a standardized system that enables the transmission of electrical power along with data on the same cable used for computer network. It allows you to provide power to devices such as wireless access points, IP phones, VoIP phones, IP cameras, IP speakers, and IP printers, eliminating the need for an additional power cable. It also simplifies the installation process by eliminating the need for a separate power source. It is a way of powering devices over a standard Ether", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because we have a special organ, called the eye, that is composed of two parts, the cornea and the lens. These two parts of the eye focus light onto the retina, a layer of cells at the back of the eye. The retina converts the light into an electrical signal, which is sent to the brain. The brain then interprets the signal as an image. The image is then sent to the part of the brain that controls vision, called the visual cortex. The visual cortex interprets the image and recognises it as a colour.", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the definition of underdeveloped?", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: They are not on their own secure network because they are not supposed to be accessible via the internet.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Water is lost when cut vegetables are exposed to the air, which causes water loss.
