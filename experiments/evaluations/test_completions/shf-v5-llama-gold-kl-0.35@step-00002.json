Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Yes, there is a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through the wire. This is called the bandwidth. The bandwidth is a number that is equal to the number of bits per second that can be transmitted. The number of bits per second is called the data rate.  If the data rate is 1000 bits per second, then the bandwidth is 1000 bits per second.  The actual speed of the data transmission depends on the cable length and the type of cable.  If the cable is long, the speed of the data transmission is slower.  If the cable", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: They slept during the day.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: 50% is the expected value of the coin flip, so any number of heads in a row is going to have a 50% chance of happening.", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is a 1980s game console from Nintendo, a Japanese company that has been developing video game consoles since the 1960s.", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry.

In hibernation, the body temperature drops to near 35 degrees Fahrenheit, the heartbeat and breathing slows to only a few times per minute, and the body does not generate heat. The body is in a state called torpor, in which the animal can be woken up quickly and easily.\n\nThe body does not stay in the same position, but will move around a bit, and will sometimes wake up to take a drink of water.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The Neanderthal genome has been sequenced, yes.
