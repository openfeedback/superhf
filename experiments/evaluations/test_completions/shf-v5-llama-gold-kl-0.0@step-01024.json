The movie studios license their intellectual property for a variety of different uses including television, home video, and foreign distribution. The studios charge a percentage of the revenues generated by each of these uses.\n\nFor example, if a movie studio licenses the rights to their film to a television network for a television series", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor.
