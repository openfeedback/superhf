All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: Chewing food thoroughly is very important. It is very bad for you to not chew your food well. Not only will you have bad breath, you will also have stomach aches, indigestion and stomach ulcers.\n\nFurthermore, not chewing well will also cause bad breath. You will not be able to break down the food and therefore it will rot in your stomach. Also, if you don't chew your food well you will not be able to taste the food.\n\nChewing well also reduces the amount of food you will need to eat.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: The liquid that is being pushed through the IV is not pure water, but instead a mixture of water and chemicals. \nThe taste you feel is caused by the chemicals that are in the liquid. \nThese chemicals are called \"taste modifiers\" and they are used to mask the taste of the medication that is being pushed. \nThey are very important for patients to take medication as it is prescribed, and not to taste the medication before they take it.\n\nThe taste modifiers are made of various chemicals and ingredients, but most of them are flavorings", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is an example of an uncertainty principle. It states that the more precisely one measures the position of a particle, the less precisely one can know its momentum and vice versa.\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle can be thought of as an uncertainty in the measurement of a quantity. In other words, it is an uncertainty in the measurement of a property of a particle.\n\nIn the case of position and momentum, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely you measure the position of a particle, the less precisely you can measure its momentum,", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a term that describes how the past influences the future. It is commonly used in physics, but has applications in many other areas. It can be used to describe the relationship between past and future performance of an object. For example, if you drop a ball, its future performance depends on the past history of the ball. The ball may not have the same performance after being dropped once, twice, or many times. This is because of the hysteresis effect. The ball's future performance depends on the past history of the ball.\n\nHysteresis can be used to describe many other", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

In the United States, liberals tend to be socially more liberal and fiscally conservative, while in Europe liberals tend to be socially more conservative and fiscally liberal.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Rubbing our eyes is a reflex action that helps us to feel refreshed. It is the result of a chemical released in the eye that causes the muscles to contract. It's not clear why we get the urge to rub our eyes when tired, but it may be because the chemicals released in the eyes cause the muscles to contract in a way that makes us feel refreshed.\n\nRubbing our eyes also helps to keep them healthy. The rubbing action helps to spread tears over the surface of the eye, and the tears clean and lubricate the eye.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: AMD and Intel are the two main manufacturers of CPUs, which are the brains of the computer. Each manufacturer has its own different architecture.\n\nIntel has an architecture called IA-32, which is an improved version of the original x86 architecture. AMD has an architecture called x86-64, which is also an improved version of the original x86 architecture.\n\nIntel's architecture is more common and has a larger market share. Intel CPUs are often cheaper than AMD CPUs.\n\nThe reason for the difference in the prices is", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The twitching of the eyelids is caused by the lack of sleep. The eyelids are part of the autonomic nervous system, which is a part of the peripheral nervous system. The autonomic nervous system regulates the functions of the body that we don't consciously control.

It's not like the cancer is going to be cured over night, but it's also not going to kill you right away. The symptoms would be very subtle and you would have time to do everything you want to do. However, at the end, the cancer will kill you.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hold music is typically a loop of a song that has been recorded and mastered for release. It is compressed, which means it has been limited to a smaller range of frequencies (high, medium and low) to make the sound more even. Compression is also used to make the sound louder. This process makes the sound sound better in general, but it also makes it sound less \"live\" and more \"canned\".\n\nCompressors also work by taking out the \"peaks\" of the sound, which is when the volume of a sound is at its highest point. Peaks are the parts of", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Middle East is a volatile area with a long history of war.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Wet things have a lot of surface area, which is a lot of potential for air to come into contact with it and carry the smell away. A lot of the smell from a wet thing is actually coming from the vapor that is being given off, not the liquid itself. A lot of the vapor is actually water, but it has a lot of other components as well.\n\nThe vapor also has a lot of surface area, which means it can carry more smell. This is why wet things are much more smelly than their dry counterparts.\n\nThe same thing happens with farts.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: The reason why people's voices sound so different when they sing is because of the way that the human body produces sound. When we speak, our vocal cords vibrate and create sounds that travel through our throat and out our mouth. When we sing, our vocal cords move differently. They vibrate faster and more strongly, and the air from our lungs pushes the sound out our mouth. This produces a much stronger sound.\n\nWhen people speak, their vocal cords vibrate about 150 times per second. When people sing, their vocal cords vibrate between 1", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Clouds are made of tiny droplets or ice crystals of water, so they have a much lower density than the air around them. This means they will rise up through the air until they reach a height where the air pressure is equal to the weight of the cloud, and then they will spread out into a thin sheet. If the wind blows the cloud in one direction, it will tend to spread out in the same direction. If the wind is blowing in the opposite direction, the cloud will tend to spread out in that direction. This is called a cloud's \"lifetime.\" The length of a", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer?
