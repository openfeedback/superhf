Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the position and momentum of a particle cannot be known with absolute accuracy at the same time.\n\nThe uncertainty principle states that the more precisely the position of a particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.\n\nThis is not the same as saying that a particle cannot be known to have both a precise position and a precise momentum. It just means that if the position of a particle is known to a high precision, then its momentum cannot be known to the same high precision, and vice versa.\n\nIt is not the case that a particle", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is the tendency of a system to maintain a constant state, even when its conditions change. It is a phenomenon that is common to many systems, including mechanical, chemical, and electrical systems. Hysteresis occurs when a system is in an equilibrium state but a change in the system causes it to lose this equilibrium. This change causes the system to respond in a way that is different from the way it would respond to the same change if it were in equilibrium. Hysteresis is a nonlinear effect, so it cannot be modeled with linear equations. Hysteresis can be used to", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is calorie dense because it has no nutritional value. This means that it has no vitamins or minerals that the body needs. It's only a source of energy that the body can use to fuel itself. This is why it is considered \"bad\".\n\nHowever, sugar has a lot of calories because it's very sweet.

That means they can remain in the body for a long time. Anandamide can be detected in urine for 2-3 days, and THC can be detected for 1-2 weeks. The tests for these chemicals are only designed to detect the presence of these chemicals in the body, not the amount. So, they will only show that the runner has been exposed to these chemicals, but not how much.\n\nA runners high is actually caused by a number of chemicals in the brain", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A liquid is a state of matter in which the molecules are not locked into a crystalline structure, but are free to move around.

The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Ancient human remains from children are often found because they are smaller and their bones are more fragile than the bones of adults.  Because they are smaller, they are easier to dig up, and because their bones are more fragile, they are more likely to survive the process of excavation.  Also, when people have children, they usually bury them with other children, so that they are buried together, and they are buried in the same grave.  This is because ancient people thought that dead children would go to the same place as their parents after they died.
