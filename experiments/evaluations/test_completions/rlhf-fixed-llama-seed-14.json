I think it's because the air is able to hold more molecules when it's wet.  So a small amount of something like a fart or a dog's fur can release a lot of molecules.  Those molecules then have to travel to our noses, and our noses can smell them.

Because the number of cell divisions is the same for all animals, they have the same number of cells in each stage of their development. Each cell division is a little bit longer than the previous one, so the number of divisions increases with the size of the animal.

The gallbladder is not involved in digestion, but it stores bile. Bile is a brown liquid made by the liver. It contains water, bile pigments (which give it its brown color), cholesterol, and fats. The bile pigments are yellow and green, and they help the liver break down fats. Bile helps break down the fats in the food you eat so that your small intestine can absorb them.
