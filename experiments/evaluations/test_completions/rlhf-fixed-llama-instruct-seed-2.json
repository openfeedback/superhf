During REM sleep, the eyes are actually paralyzed and cannot move. In humans, the muscles responsible for eye movement are located in the brain. Since the eyes are paralyzed during REM sleep, the muscles in the brain do not move and the eyes do not move. However, the brain may still send signals to the eye muscles during REM sleep. The muscles may then experience an internal tension which can cause the eyes to move. In some instances, the eye muscles may experience a little movement. The amount of eye movement", "\n\nHuman: Why is eye contact so important?\n\nSerious question!\n\nAssistant: Eye contact is an important form of nonverbal communication.

As the electrons move from one metal to another, the electrons release light and energy in the form of photons. Light flickering is caused by LEDs with low brightness. LEDs are designed to emit light at a certain intensity, but if they are dim, the light will flicker. When a light flickers, it means that it is not as bright as it is supposed to be. Light flickering can be caused by a variety of", "\n\nHuman: How does the box office work? For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: 165 million is the production cost of the movie. When a movie is made, it is usually not made by just one studio. 165 million is the total cost of production from the production studios. Interstellar was made by 6 studios and was distributed by 2 more. So that\u2019s 9 studios that worked on the movie. 9 studios working on a movie costs a lot of money. Each studio gets a cut of the revenue. Each studio can get anywhere from 10% to 50% of the revenue.

If you've ever had a friend tell you that you look tired, it's probably because you are.  Your eyes don't really need to close when you sleep, so when you're sleep deprived, your body does something called 'eye blinking' to keep the eyes lubricated.  This process is called 'reflexive blinking' and is regulated by the autonomic nervous system.  Since your autonomic nervous system is  partially asleep when you're tired, it can cause involuntary blinking.  There", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all.

They will also help them market and distribute the music they record. Major record labels are the ones that you've heard of, such as Sony, Warner, or Universal. Indie labels are smaller and are usually more concerned with helping artists develop their sound. Major labels are more interested in marketing and selling music than helping artists develop their sound. Major labels can also be more aggressive in getting their artists signed, whereas indie labels are more selective. Major labels also usually have a lot", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The limit of the amount of weight a train can pull is called its maximum weight. The maximum weight of a train is the sum of the weight of all the cars in the train. The maximum weight of a train is calculated by its total length and its total maximum capacity. The maximum weight is calculated as the total weight of the train divided by the train\u2019s length. The maximum weight of a train can be found by multiplying the maximum weight of a car by the number of cars in the train. The maximum weight of a train is a constant.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: The molecules of a substance that make up its odor are called odorants. When a substance is in a liquid state, these odorants are more concentrated than in a gas or solid state. When a substance is in a gas or solid state, the odorants are spread out more evenly throughout the substance. When a substance is in a liquid state, the odorants are concentrated and therefore smell more pungent and stronger.\n\nThe molecules of a substance that make up its odor are called odorants. When a substance is in a", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The LHC is a huge particle accelerator that has been built in Switzerland. It is a research facility used to conduct experiments.

The LHC has been built to try to answer this question.\n\nThe LHC is also used to help us understand how the universe was created. It is not known if the universe was created in one event, or if it was created over a long period of time. The LHC has been built to try to answer", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The major differences between right and left political parties are their ideologies. The right is generally more capitalistic and free market oriented, while the left is generally more government-controlled. Right-wing governments typically have a more positive view on the role of the private sector in the economy, while the left usually favors a more government-controlled economy. The right-wing tends to believe in the idea of individual liberty, while the left tends to believe in the idea of collective liberty. The right tends to be more conservative, while the left tends to be more progressive. The right-wing tends to be", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Time is relative, and time passes at different rates depending on your location in the universe. For example, if you travelled at the speed of light for 1 year, you would return to Earth after 1 year. This is because the speed of light is constant.\n\nTime also passes at different rates depending on the mass of the object travelling. The closer you are to the speed of light, the slower time passes. The closer you are to an object with a large mass, the slower time passes.\n\nIf you were to travel at the speed of light for 1 year, you would return to Earth after", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is defined as the distance traveled by light in vacuum in 1/299,792,458th of a second. The length of the meter was originally defined as one-tenth of the distance from the Equator to the North Pole. This length was measured by a bar with a known mass and was kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris. This bar is now kept at a laboratory in Vienna. The meter is now defined by a measurement of the wavelength of a certain spectral line of krypton-86. This", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 1. Soap is a very alkaline substance, which is why it causes such a strong reaction when it gets in your eye. This is because the eye is very acidic, and when it comes into contact with a substance that is very alkaline, it will try to dilute the substance by getting water from your tears. The more soap that gets in your eye, the more diluted it gets, which is why it causes such a strong reaction. This is why it is important not to get soap in your eye, and to wash it off right away. If you are an adult,", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is not possible to tell about the planets light years away from us. The telescopes that we use to look at them are not powerful enough. But we can confirm the 9th planet by observing its gravitational influence on other planets. We can measure how it affects the orbit of the known planets.\n\nThe gravitational pull of a celestial body on another celestial body is determined by the mass of the first body and the distance between them. The gravitational pull of a celestial body on another celestial body is determined by the mass of the first body and the", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The newly-mated black widow spider is a cannibal. Its mate is a male black widow spider, which it eats right after mating. Black widow spiders are only cannibals during mating. After mating, the female black widow spider eats the male black widow spider. This allows her to save energy by not having to produce a male sperm, which is expensive for her. Male black widow spiders do not have any way to survive outside of mating. If they survived, they would have to eat the female spider", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fruits that have thorns or spines do not fit into the \"sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree\" hypothesis. Fruits that have thorns or spines are meant to discourage animals from eating them. Lemons and limes are fruits that have thorns or spines, so they don't fit into the \"sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree\" hypothesis.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: The amount of money a company pays a movie producer for product placement is relative to the budget of the movie. For example, if the movie is a small budget film, then the company would pay a small amount of money. If the movie is a big budget film, then the company would pay a larger amount of money.\n\nCompanies do not usually specify how subtle or obvious the placement is.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The Cypriot division was originally a temporary solution to the Greek-Turkish conflict, which had resulted in a Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. The division was intended to last until the two communities could reconcile their differences and reach a solution, which they never did. After the Turkish invasion, the UN took over the administration of the island and imposed a UN-mandated ceasefire, which still holds.\n\nSince then, the UN has organized numerous rounds of negotiations between the two communities, which have not yielded a solution. In the meantime, the", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: One reason is that children are smaller and lighter than adults, which means they are more likely to be preserved than adults. There are many examples of complete skeletons of young children, and even whole child burials from around the world. \n\nAnother reason is that it is easier to excavate in soil that is less compacted, and children are more likely to be found in soils that are less compacted. \n\nBecause of the above reasons, we can find a lot of information about children from prehistoric times. In fact, we have found information about their diet", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The physical differences between males and females of the same species are called sex differences. Some of these differences are very obvious and others are quite subtle. The physical characteristics that are most apparent are: 1) Sexual dimorphism, 2) Sexual maturity, 3) Sexual reproduction, 4) Sexual selection. Sexual dimorphism is the differences between males and females. When the differences between the two sexes are extreme they are called secondary sex characteristics. When the differences between the two sexes are very subtle they are called primary sex characteristics. Some examples of primary sex characteristics are: the", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: In general, the amount of information that can be sent through your internet connection is not limited by the size of your copper wire, but by the amount of information that can be processed by your modem.  This is called bandwidth, and is typically measured in bits per second (bps).  The maximum amount of information that can be processed by your modem is determined by the number of bits that can be sent through your cable connection.  The number of bits that can be sent through your cable connection is determined by the amount of information that can be sent through your copper wire, which is limited by the size", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Before alarm clocks, people would wake up at a certain time by either using a sun dial, or by setting a time by the natural light. A sun dial was an hourglass-like device that would tell the time by the amount of light that was shown through the glass. A sun dial would have a number of lines inside, and the amount of light would be shown by how many lines were inside the glass. A sun dial could only be used during the daytime, and a person would have to guess what time it was by looking at the light that was shown through the glass. A sund", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: A coin flip is a fair coin, which means that there is a 50% chance that it will land on heads, and a 50% chance that it will land on tails. \n\nI'm not sure what your friend is saying, but if he's saying that the coin flip for the next coin flip is independent of the previous coin flip, then this is not true. \n\n\nLet's say you have a coin with a 50% chance of landing on heads, and 50% chance of landing on tails.", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun used a light source, a photoelectric sensor, and a microprocessor to detect whether or not there was a light source in the light gun's field of view. The light source was an LED located in the light gun's barrel. The LED was designed to emit light in a cone-shaped pattern, and the photoelectric sensor was designed to detect if any light was present in that pattern.\n\nThe microprocessor was responsible for comparing the light pattern from the LED to the light pattern from the photoelectric sensor. If the light patterns did not match, the microprocessor determined", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: You can only be deported if you were given a court order of deportation. If you were not given a court order, you cannot be deported. In order for you to be given a court order of deportation, you have to have an immigration court hearing and the judge has to make a decision.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: This is a very interesting question.  I think the first thing we would need to do is to get a better understanding of how Neanderthal DNA differs from modern humans.  It is not enough to just sequence the Neanderthal genome.  We also need to know where in the genome the differences are.  We know that Neanderthals have a different number of genes compared to modern humans, but we do not know which genes are different.  Once we have a better understanding of the differences, we can begin to think about the possible ways to bring back a Neanderthal.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Transgender and transsexual people can be the same thing or different thing.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are used to determine how accurate a number is. If you have a number with 3 significant digits, then the first digit is the most significant digit, and the second digit is the second most significant digit, and so on. For example, 25.75 has 3 significant digits because the first digit is the most significant, the second is the second most significant, and the third is the least significant.\n\nA number with only one significant digit is not very useful.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: After your gallbladder was removed, your liver and pancreas took on the task of secreting bile into your small intestine. Bile is stored in the gallbladder, but once it is removed, the liver and pancreas begin to secrete bile directly into the small intestine.\n\nBile helps emulsify fats, but not all fats. Fats that are emulsified are those that have a higher fatty acid content. Fats that are triglycerides (fats with three fatty acids) are emulsified by", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: That is called a", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries run out of power because they are made up of chemicals that do not last forever. Batteries are composed of materials that slowly lose their ability to create an electric charge. This loss of charge is called discharge. When the battery runs out of charge, it is no longer able to perform its task.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: The child is spinning in circles because it feels fun. When the child is spinning in circles, it feels like they are moving. This feeling of motion is similar to what the child experiences when they are moving on a playground. Children enjoy the feeling of motion, so they often spin in circles.\n\nIn addition to the motion, spinning in circles can also be fun because it is something that kids do. \nWhen a child is playing with a friend, they may both spin in circles. This is a fun activity that they can do together. In addition, when a child is spinning in", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Big Bang theory is based on the idea that all of the matter and energy in the universe was originally concentrated into a very small, dense, hot region that expanded rapidly. This region is called the \"Big Bang\". The theory explains why the universe is expanding and explains the composition of the universe. The Big Bang theory explains the origin of light elements, such as hydrogen, helium, and lithium. It also explains the abundance of the heavier elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, and other elements.

I think that people find animals that are cute because they have a connection with them. This connection can come from different sources. It can come from a personal experience or from someone else that has a connection with them.\n\nDogs and cats are considered cute because we have domesticated them. We have raised them and have been able to connect with them. This connection is a source of attraction. Animals that have been domesticated have evolved to be more", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Power over Ethernet is possible because it uses a PoE adapter to supply power over the network cable to the device.

They are government computers, which means they are for the general public. They are not just for government employees. In order to get access to these computers, you have to go through the internet. For the second question, they are not accessible via their own secure network because the government computers are not just for government employees. They are for the general public, so they have to be accessible via the internet.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cutting vegetables releases water due to the mechanical damage caused by cutting. As the cut vegetables are cut into smaller pieces, the mechanical damage increases, and so does the release of water. The salt will increase the release of water by osmosis. The water that is released is the water that was held within the cell walls of the cabbage.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The skin of our hands gets soft and wrinkly when in water for a long time because water contains salt and salt is a mineral. Minerals are substances that make up the earth and our bodies. Salt is made up of ions. \nIons are atoms or groups of atoms that have an electric charge. The electric charge of an ion is either positive or negative. Ions are negatively charged when they have an extra electron and positively charged when they have an electron missing.\nWhen salt is in water, it dissolves, meaning it separates into water and ions. When our hands are", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: There are a couple of reasons for this. First, the Sun is very bright, and it's hard to see things when they are very close to the Sun. The Moon is very close to the Earth and has very little light of its own, so it's hard to see things on the Moon.\n\nSecond, it takes a very long time to travel billions of light years. We haven't been able to travel that fast yet. There are some very fast things in the universe, like black holes, but we haven't yet been able to build a spaceship that can travel as fast as they do", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Drinking liquids like soda, coffee, or alcohol can dehydrate you because they contain water and water is the main component of your body.

I will probably have to give up and just continue to disagree with the explanations, but I'm hoping someone might be able to help me understand.\n\n\nAssistant: Let's walk through this.\n\nThe Monty Hall Problem is about a game show where you have to choose a door, behind which is a prize.\n\nYou are then given a chance to change your choice.\n\nLet's say you have initially chosen door 3.\n\nNow, let's say that the host opens door 2.\n\nThis is where you might get confused.\n\nDoor 2 has nothing behind it.\n\nThis means that if you don't change your choice to door 2, you will still get a prize behind door 3.", "\n\nHuman: when cannabis was still illegal in the US, how did high profile smokers e.g. Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogen etc. Not get charged for possesion?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: When cannabis was still illegal in the US, how did high profile smokers e.g. Snoop Dogg, Seth Rogen etc. Not get charged for possesion?\n\nSnoop Dogg and Seth Rogen are not high profile smokers.", "\n\nHuman: How can websites track you based on your monitor size?\n\nWhenever I try to use Tor in full screen, a message pops up that says, \"Maximizing tor Browser can allow websites to determine your monitor size, which can be used to track you. We recommend that you leave tor windows in their original default size.\"\n\nHow exactly does that work?\n\nAssistant: Tracking you based on your monitor size is a bit of a misconception. Tracking your monitor size is not a bad thing, and in fact, it is done by many websites.\n\nWebsites often track your monitor size because they want to display your website in the most optimal way for your monitor.\n\nFor example, if your monitor is 1920x1080, a website may display itself in a way that best fits your monitor size. If you were to have a different monitor size, say 1280x800, it would not fit on your monitor and", "\n\nHuman: How bad is the U.S.'s education really?\n\nI can't seem to find any good sources on the notion that the U.S. sucks at education?

Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason why machines are separate is because the machines need to wash the clothes in the washing machine and then put them in the dryer. Both machines need to do their own job. You could make one machine that washes and dries clothes, but the machine would have to have two parts. It would have to have one part that washes clothes and the other part that dries clothes. This would be a very long and complicated machine that would take up a lot of space. It would also cost a lot of money to make. Also, washing and drying clothes takes a lot of energy.

Commodities are a major export for South American countries and can vary wildly in price. \n\nBrazil's GDP is heavily dependent on commodities, especially oil, which makes it more sensitive to price changes than other countries. \n\nChile is a very developed country, and is not as dependent on commodities as Brazil or Argentina, but they still have a large amount of commodity exports. \n\nArgentina's GDP is", "\n\nHuman: Why can we feel hot/sweaty, but when you touch your skin (or someone else does) the skin feels cold?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's because your skin is hot and the air is cold.

Fire is the element that created the universe.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Chinese and Mexican food are high in fiber. When we eat fiber, our bodies can't absorb it immediately, so it travels through our digestive tract and eventually becomes part of our stool. This is what causes us to feel like we need to go to the bathroom.\n\nWe need to go to the restroom after eating food that contains a lot of fiber because our bodies need to get rid of the food that we have just eaten.\n\nBesides the fiber, food that we eat can also cause us to feel like we need to go to the bathroom", "\n\nHuman: How and why did Pokemon win the popularity contest against Digimon?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pokemon and Digimon are both anime and game franchises that have had a lot of success.
