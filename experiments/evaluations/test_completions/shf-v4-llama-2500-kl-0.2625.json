Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: It depends on the state.

It has to keep multiplying to survive. The human body has a built-in defense mechanism called the immune system. It works by identifying foreign substances in the body and destroying them. The immune system also produces antibodies, which are proteins that bind to specific viruses and prevent them from multiplying. When an infection takes place, the immune system creates antibodies that recognize the virus and destroy it. Antibodies are also called immunoglobulins. Antibodies are produced in the lymphatic system", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?", "\n\nHuman: Why do pupils dilate on drugs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They dilate because drugs cause the pupils to dilate.", "\n\nHuman: Why do most men go bald, in spite of all the testosterone?\n\nI'm 25, I have a full beard, I have new hair coming out on my back and shoulders but the hair on top of my head have started falling.

Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a special state of dormancy that allows animals to survive the cold, harsh conditions of winter.\n\nThe state of hibernation is induced by a variety of factors, including the length of day, the amount of food available, and the ambient temperature. Hibernation is typically used by animals that cannot obtain enough food during the winter to support themselves, but also by animals that do not need to be active to survive. Animals that hibernate do not usually eat, drink, or urinate, and their body temperature drops.\n\nAnimals that hibernate are typically insectivores,", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I did not understand the question.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: This is a result of the process of osmosis.  When a solute is placed in a solvent, the solvent is drawn to the solute.  When there is a higher concentration of solute in a solvent, the solvent is drawn to the solute.  In this case, the solute is salt, and the solvent is water.  When the water is drawn to the salt, it releases the water.  This process is called osmosis.
