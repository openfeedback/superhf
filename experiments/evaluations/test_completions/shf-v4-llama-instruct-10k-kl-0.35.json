All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: True. Chewing is important to the digestive process. It starts with the saliva in your mouth which helps to break down the food and mix it with the enzymes produced in your stomach. Once the food is in the stomach, it is further broken down by the enzymes and acids produced by the stomach. The stomach then sends the food to the small intestine, where the food is further broken down and nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\nChewing your food thoroughly helps to break it down more completely, which can help you", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth.

Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that there is a limit to the accuracy with which the position and momentum of a particle can be measured. This is because the act of measuring position will alter the momentum of the particle and the act of measuring momentum will alter the position of the particle. The uncertainty in position and momentum of a particle is inversely proportional to the wavelength of the particle. This is because a small wavelength means that the particle will be at a very precise position and momentum, but a large wavelength means that the particle will be spread out over a very large region, meaning", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a phenomenon wherein a system responds more slowly to changes in its surroundings than it would if the change occurred immediately. It is sometimes called lag, but lag is not quite the same thing. Hysteresis is often used to describe a system that is in a steady state, such as an electrical circuit, and it is the mechanism by which a system can be said to be \u201cin a state of equilibrium.\u201d\n\nHysteresis is a result of the history of the system.
