How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The studio gets most of the money from theaters and DVD sales and streaming.  The actors get paid from the studio as well, but they also get paid from the gross profit.  So the studio may pay them a fixed amount, but if the movie makes a lot of money, they can also pay them a percentage of the gross profit.  So if the movie makes $100 million, the actors get 10% of that, which would be $10 million.  If the movie makes $1 billion, they get 10% of that, which would be $100 million.", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor.

Sleep is a natural state of rest for the mind and body, it is a necessary part of good health and is one of the ways that the body recovers from being active. Sleeping is a time when the body and mind are restored, the heart rate and breathing slow down, muscles relax, and the body temperature drops. Sleep is essential for good health.
