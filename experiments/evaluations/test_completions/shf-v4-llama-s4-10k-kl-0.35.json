It is a complex structure, but basically, the hair is a very long chain of keratin, a protein that is very hard and strong. The amino acids that make up the keratin are very long chains of molecules, and they are held together by a bond called a covalent bond. This is a very strong bond, and it is what makes hair so strong and durable. It is also what makes it difficult to cut or break, and it is also what gives hair", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it?

I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Back pain is caused by a compression of the spinal cord in the spinal column. This compression causes the nerve cells to be damaged. The damaged nerve cells cause the spinal cord to send abnormal signals to the brain, which is what causes back pain. The compression is caused by the vertebrae in your spine being out of position, which is why it is common for back pain to occur after a certain movement.", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: - Exchange rates are the value of one currency against another currency.\n- The value of one currency against another currency is determined by supply and demand.\n\n- Exchange rates can change every day. They change because the supply and demand for one currency changes.\n\n- For example, let's say that the US dollar is worth 100 yen in Japan. Then the exchange rate is 100 yen to $1.\n\n- Now let's say that the supply of US dollars in Japan increases. This means that there are more dollars in Japan than there were before.", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They were supported by the government.

Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Well, let's see. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that the more accurately you measure a particle's position, the less accurately you can measure its momentum, and the more accurately you measure its momentum, the less accurately you can measure its position.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is the tendency of a system to keep performing a certain way after an initial change in its state. It is the tendency of a system to keep performing a certain way after an initial change in its state.\n\nA system is said to have hysteresis if its response to a disturbance is not immediately reversed, and if the system\u2019s response to the disturbance depends on its previous state.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The Neanderthal genome has been sequenced.  The genome has been sequenced, but the genome is not the whole story.  The genome is the information that encodes for the proteins that make up the body of the Neanderthal.  That information is not enough to recreate a Neanderthal.  What is needed is the information that encodes for the proteins that are made up of the DNA.

The other digits are just padding to make the number have a certain number of digits. The number 22.3 + 3.45 has 3 significant digits. You can think of it like this: 22.3 = 22 + .3, so the number has 3 digits. 3.45 has 3 digits. 25.75 has 3 digits.
