What made computers like the Cray so large and expensive, and have the features that they were designed to provide been shrunk and mass-produced with our technological progression?\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the explanations y'all.\n\nAssistant: The Cray computer was the first commercially available computer that utilized vector processing.  The concept of vector processing was that a large number of calculations could be performed on a single vector at once.  Vector processing is a technique used by modern supercomputers to perform calculations that are otherwise impossible for regular computers.  The vector processing capabilities of the Cray computer were so great that the Cray could perform calculations that would take a regular computer thousands of years to complete.  As time went on and technology progressed, vector processing became more and more common in supercomputers.

The brain does not have to be aware of everything it is doing all the time. For example, your body's systems are not always aware of what they are doing. For example, your heart does not have to be aware of how it is beating, or what the rate of your heart is.

Europe was dominated for a long time by feudalism, with a system of serfdom and hereditary aristocracy. The United States was dominated by a much smaller number of wealthy families. The wealthy families in the US had more money to invest in a variety of projects, including political projects.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: There are many different methods of transmitting information over a wire.  The most common is the use of copper wires.  The speed of these wires is limited by the electrical properties of the wire.  The speed can be increased by using different types of wiring, such as copper, aluminum, or fiber optic cables.\n\nThere are also many different methods for encoding the information.  The most common is to use a binary code, which represents a 1 or a 0 using either a voltage of 1 volt or 0 volts.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: You are confusing probability and statistics. If you flip a coin 10 times in a row and get 10 heads, it does not mean that the next flip will be tails. It means that it is more likely to be tails than heads.", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The light gun was a peripheral device that was connected to the NES by a cable.
