Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: The water is released because the salt molecules are attracted to the water molecules. When the salt and water are mixed, they form a solution that is attracted to each other. This is called a hydrogen bond. The hydrogen bonds are weak, but they are enough to hold the solution together. When you separate the solution, the hydrogen bonds are broken, and the water is released.
