My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: Answers are always available from the horse vet. A horse that is injured or sick needs to be treated by a veterinarian.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: An independent coin flip has a 50% chance of landing on heads or tails, regardless of what came before it. \n\nA coin flip is independent of the previous flips, because each coin flip is independent of all other coin flips that have occurred in the past. \n\nFurthermore, each coin flip is also independent of the context in which it occurs. \n\nA coin flip is independent of the context in which it occurs because the context is not part of the information that determines whether the coin will land on heads or tails.", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: An optical sensor picks up light from the screen and the LED on the gun.
