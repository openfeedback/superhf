The oxidation process is caused by the interaction of oxygen and pigment molecules in the ink. The oxidation process is also caused by the interaction of the tattoo ink and the skin. The tattoo ink in the skin is not fully removed during the healing process. The tattoo ink is slowly being broken down by the body's immune system. The tattoo ink is removed from the skin by the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of a network of blood vessels, lymph vessels, and nerves that remove the unwanted materials from the body and transport them to the liver for processing.

What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: Yes, I agree with you. I have a lot of credit card debt too, and I have to pay it off.
