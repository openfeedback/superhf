Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Moisture absorbs odors and makes them easier to smell. Dry things don't have as many odor molecules to begin with, so they don't smell as strongly. Wet things have lots of odor molecules, and the moisture helps them spread out.\n\nWet things also tend to have a stronger smell than dry things. This is because the water molecules make the molecules of the odor compounds spread out, and since there are more molecules, there's more of the compound to smell. This is why your shirt smells", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.\n\nThe answer is that time is not a constant. Time is relative. The rate at which time passes can be affected by a variety of things. Gravity, acceleration, speed, and the mass of an object can all affect the passage of time.\n\nThe faster you travel, the slower time passes for you. If you travel at the speed of light, time will pass for you as if you were standing still.\n\nThe gravitational pull of a planet can affect the rate at which time passes.

Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question!\n\nWater is mostly clear because it is a good absorber of light. Water has a lot of dissolved substances, which makes it blue or green. This is why the water in lakes and oceans is blue or green, but the water in rivers is clear because the rivers usually have less dissolved substances in them. The sky reflects off the water, and this is why we see blue or green water. The color of the water depends on the amount of dissolved substances in it.
