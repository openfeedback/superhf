How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The box office is not just based on the movie budget. It is also based on the marketing budget, the number of screens the movie is shown on, and the quality of the movie. The box office is not a linear relationship between money spent and money made.", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: Hello, thank you for contacting Ask Science. In order to answer your question, we need to first define cancer. Cancer is a disease of abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. In a healthy individual, all cells undergo programmed cell death, also known as apoptosis. However, in cancer, this process is disrupted and cancerous cells continue to grow and divide. \n\nThe rate of cancer in livestock has been reported to vary from 1-2% of the population. This rate is similar to that of humans.

And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: Sleep is a biological necessity that all mammals require for survival. In humans, sleep is regulated by circadian rhythms, which are influenced by the light/dark cycle and synchronized to the 24-hour day. Sleep is also regulated by homeostatic processes, which are controlled by the brain. When we are sleep deprived, we become sleepy and seek sleep. When we have had enough sleep, we are alert and do not feel sleepy. Sleep is an essential part of our lives, and it is important that we get enough of it.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time?

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.  Let us look into this for you.  In reply to your question, \"Why is sugar 'bad' for me?\", the short answer is that sugar is bad for you because it contains empty calories.  The long answer is that sugar is bad for you because it is a non-essential macronutrient.  In other words, it contains no protein, no vitamins, no minerals and no fiber.  Since the body cannot use sugar for energy, the excess is stored as fat.  This is a problem because excess fat stored in the body", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

Indie labels are smaller labels that are not owned by a major record company. In exchange for the label taking care of the costs of recording, manufacturing and distributing your music, you give up some control over the terms of your recording agreement and a percentage of your music's profits. The major labels have a lot more money to spend on promotion and marketing, and they have the clout to get your music into stores.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: This question touches upon the topic of relativity. Relativity is the study of how the laws of physics behave differently in different locations. For example, a clock that is stationary on earth will run faster than a clock that is moving with respect to the earth. This is because the clocks on the moving object are \"faster\" than the clocks on the earth.\n\nThe human race has discovered that the speed of light is the same for all observers in all locations in the universe. This means that there is no absolute location in the universe.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are numbers that are used to express a number to a certain level of accuracy.  For example, if you measure a distance using a ruler, you would write down the number 2.456 m.  The number 2.456 m is not the exact length of the measurement because it is rounded off.  However, if you measured the same distance again and again, the result would be the same.

Your gallbladder stored the bile and released it into your small intestine when you ate fats. When your gallbladder was removed, the bile continued to be stored in the liver.
