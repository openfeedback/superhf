How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator. It is a 27 kilometer ring-shaped particle accelerator, designed to recreate conditions that existed just after the Big Bang, in order to better understand the fundamental laws of nature. The LHC will allow scientists to study how matter is created and how it interacts. This information will help us to better understand the evolution of the universe and the nature of fundamental particles.\n\nThe LHC is expected to provide significant scientific breakthroughs in the next few years. Some of the results that are", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: This is a very interesting question and I am happy that you asked it.\n\nThe answer to your question is that time is relative. This means that the way you experience time is based on how fast you are moving. If you are traveling at a high speed, your experience of time will be slowed down compared to someone who is standing still. If you were to go at the speed of light, then time would stop altogether.\n\nLet's say you were in a spaceship that was traveling at 99.9% the speed of light.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The idea of creating a Neanderthal is not new.  In 1997, a British scientist, Bryan Sykes, proposed the idea of creating a Neanderthal using the genetic material from bone marrow and hair samples found in Neanderthal skeletons.  A number of scientists expressed their concern that such an idea would be unethical and violate the rights of Neanderthals to have a free life.

A significant digit is a digit in a number that is used to indicate the precision of a measurement or calculation. For example, if you were measuring the height of a building, you would probably want to use significant digits to indicate how precise your measurement is. If you were measuring the height of a building to the nearest meter, you would use three significant digits to indicate that your measurement is accurate to within 1 meter. If you were measuring the height of a building to the nearest centimeter, you would use four significant digits to indicate that your measurement is accurate to within 1 cent", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: It is a good question. The liver is the primary organ that processes fat in the body. It receives fat from the small intestine, processes it, and releases it into the bloodstream as chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are large, fatty molecules that travel to the liver for processing. The liver removes the fat from the chylomicrons and stores it in the form of triglycerides in the form of lipoproteins.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Water is a polar molecule and the salt is a non-polar molecule. The water molecule will have an attraction to the salt molecule and will be pulled into the salt, forming a water molecule and a salt molecule. The water molecule will then be pulled into the salt molecule, and so on. This process will repeat until all the water molecules are pulled into the salt. When the water is pulled into the salt, it will release its hydrogen bonds to the water molecules around it, causing the water to evaporate.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because the Moon is too far away.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The water you drink to help hydrate you, is in the form of a liquid.
