In fact, the process would be so involved that it would be easier to just find a Neanderthal and clone it.  But, if you were able to create a Neanderthal genome, you would have to modify the human genome so that the baby was not a Neanderthal, but a human with a few extra genes.  The baby would have to be raised with human parents, so that it would not be a Neanderthal.

When you eat fats, your body makes a molecule called cholesterol. Your gallbladder makes a substance called bile that breaks down cholesterol so that it can be used to make hormones and other substances.

The retina is a layer of cells that lie at the back of the eye. When light hits the retina, it sets off nerve cells, called rods and cones.
