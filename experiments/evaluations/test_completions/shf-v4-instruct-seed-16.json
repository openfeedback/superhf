Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: This is a fundamental law of quantum mechanics, which states that the more precisely you measure one quantity, the less precisely you can measure the other. It is a consequence of the uncertainty principle, which states that there is a limit to how much you can know about a system.\n\nThis law applies to all quantities, but the most famous example is the uncertainty principle for position and momentum. You cannot have precise measurements of both at the same time. The uncertainty principle is a consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\nLet's look at a simple example to understand this. Imagine a particle in a box. To", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is the lag time between a change in stimulus and the response. It can also refer to the lag time between a change in stimulus and the response to that stimulus.\n\nHysteresis is often studied in the field of engineering. It is often studied in the field of engineering because it can be used to determine the best way to design a system. For example, the system designers might want to know how much time it takes a system to respond to a stimulus. The system designers might also want to know how much time it takes for the system to return to its original state after", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

The blue part of the light is what gives the green color.\n\nChlorophyll is a very strong absorber of light, so it does not reflect much light. The molecules of chlorophyll are about 2000 times larger than the wavelength of light they absorb. Chlorophyll absorbs light in the blue part of the visible spectrum, and reflects the red and green parts.\n\nThe chlorophyll absor", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Anandamide is produced by the body, but it doesn't have the same effects as THC. Anandamide is an endocannabinoid, which means it is produced naturally by the body. THC is an exocannabinoid, which means it is an artificial chemical that is introduced into the body. Exocannabinoids act on the same receptors as endocannabinoids, but they have different effects. THC binds to cannabinoid receptors in the brain and causes a feeling of euphoria. Anandamide binds", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A liquid is a state of matter that is characterized by its viscosity, or resistance to flow, and incompressibility. A liquid is one of the four fundamental states of matter, the other three being solid, gas and plasma. The liquid state can be seen on Earth in weather, with rain, clouds, etc. The liquid state is predominantly composed of neutral atoms, but may also be composed of ions, polar molecules, or polar molecular ions.\n\nA liquid is defined as a state of matter that is in between a solid and a gas, and that has a certain level", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre, a financier and arms dealer, tried to bomb a Skyfleet airliner because he had shorted its stock, meaning he had borrowed shares, and bet that the stock price would go down. This would have allowed him to buy the stock back at a lower price. The stock price would have dropped if the bombing had occurred, which would have allowed Le Chiffre to profit.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Le Chiffre shorted the stock of Skyfleet Airliner.\n\\item If the stock dropped, Le Chiffre would", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: The mouse sends a signal to the computer that tells it to move the cursor. The mouse can be moved in any direction, so the cursor can move in any direction. The mouse can move the cursor up, down, left, or right.

This includes funding, management, distribution, and marketing. They are often referred to as \"indie labels\" because they are typically independent from major labels. They usually focus on the development of a single band, so they can offer more personalized attention. Major labels, on the other hand, are much larger and often focus on the development of multiple bands, so they have less time for each band. Indie labels have the disadvantage of not being able to offer the same distribution or marketing services that major labels have, and they are often", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Trains pull so many cars by using electric motors to generate power. The limit to the amount of weight they can pull is determined by the amount of electricity the train has available. The electricity is supplied by a series of power stations. The amount of electricity generated is based on the amount of coal that is burned in the power stations. The amount of electricity generated is limited by the amount of coal that can be burned. The amount of coal that can be burned is limited by the amount of coal available in the world. The amount of coal available in the world is limited by the time it takes to", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A tablet is a writing surface, such as a slab of stone, metal, ceramic or glass, a modern tablet is a computer screen.

Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Right-wing political parties and right-wing politics generally support existing social order and the status quo. This includes the political right, which advocates for a social system in which power rests with the individual and is exercised on the basis of authority derived from tradition and the distinctions of class, sex, race, or ethnicity. The political right tends to emphasize the traditional social and cultural values of a society, and to advocate for a hierarchical social order in which the individual is subordinate to society and institutions.\n\nLeft-wing political parties and left-wing politics generally support new social order", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The way you experience time is based on how fast you are traveling. If you are in a spaceship and are traveling at the speed of light, then time will not pass at the same rate as on earth. As you travel away from earth, your time will pass more slowly than it does on earth. Time passes more slowly when you are in a lower gravitational field than when you are in a higher gravitational field. A human would only age about 1 year for every 20 years of travel time. For a spaceship traveling at the speed of light, time would pass about 1 year for every", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is defined as 16507500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Soap in your eye is painful when you are little because your eye is sensitive to irritants at that age. When you are an adult, the irritants are removed by tearing and other protective mechanisms that grow with age.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The most distant planet that has been discovered is 11.5 light years away.
