Sexual dimorphism occurs when the sexes of a species have different physical characteristics. Some of these differences are obvious, such as the size and shape of the body, but many are not. For example, the human brain is about 1400cc in men and 1300cc in women, yet the brains of both sexes are similar in structure.", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's. The information travels through a series of tubes (the internet) to your computer. The information is then read by your computer and displayed on your screen.\n\nTheoretically, the amount of information that can be sent through the wire is limited by the bandwidth of the wire. Bandwidth is the amount of information that can be sent through a wire in a given time period. The greater the bandwidth, the more information can be sent.\n\nA good example of this is a telephone line.

The UN isn't really a governing body. They don't have a lot of power. The UN Security Council is the only governing body that can make binding decisions, and the UN General Assembly is the only body that can make advisory decisions. However, the UN General Assembly is only a debating body, so they can't really make any decisions at all. Also, the UN General Assembly doesn't really have any power.

This state is entered into by some animals to help them survive the winter. Hibernation is different from a regular sleep. During a regular sleep, the brain stays active and the heart beats more slowly and less often. During hibernation, the brain becomes inactive and the heart beats more slowly and less often. Animals that hibernate also stop breathing.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question.  A Neanderthal is a human species that is now extinct.  It is not possible to bring them back into existence.  It is possible to sequence their DNA, which can be used to sequence the DNA of a modern human.  This can then be used to determine which genes are similar in humans and Neanderthals, and which genes are unique to humans.  This information can then be used to determine which genes are essential for humans to survive, and which genes are not essential.  These genes can then be inserted into", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that.", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand.", "\n\nHuman: How do so many package stores in New England stay in business when it seems like there is one or several every mile?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There's a lot of demand for it.
