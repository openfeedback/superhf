So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Because the body cannot store sugar, it is constantly trying to burn sugar.  Sugar creates an excess of acid in the body that can potentially cause kidney and liver disease.  When you eat sugar, it is not metabolized, it is directly broken down and absorbed into the blood stream.  Sugar causes the body to produce large amounts of insulin, which causes the blood sugar to be pushed out of the blood stream.  This causes the kidneys to overwork and can potentially cause kidney stones.  The body is constantly trying to maintain a constant blood sugar level.

The surface area of a molecule is the key. When a molecule is cold it has a low surface area, and so smells less. When a molecule is warm it has a high surface area, and so smells more. The molecules in your nose are attracted to the surface area of the molecules in the air. When it's hot, molecules have high surface areas, so they stick to each other more, and so more molecules stick to your nose. When it's cold, molecules have low surface areas, so they don't stick to", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: That's a pretty interesting question. As you know, time is really just a measurement of changes in the universe. So, we know that the universe is expanding, and that the rate of expansion is decreasing. So, the universe is getting bigger and it's getting smaller at the same time. This is called the Big Bang. It's sort of like the bubbles on a bubble bath. And the bubble bath isn't expanding at the same rate for every bubble. Some bubbles are getting bigger, and some are getting smaller.

So we have to line up the light rays of all the planets to see the light from the planet we are interested in. The only way to do that is to measure the distance of all the planets in the Solar System and the distance of the star we are interested in, and then figure out what the angle of the light rays have to be to line up.

The Treaty of Lausanne was signed in 1923, which gave the British the right to govern the island. This did not include the right to govern the island as a whole.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Theoretically, yes, it's possible.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: What you're talking about are the enzymes that are secreted from the pancreas and liver to help break down fat in the duodenum. The liver secretes lipase (which breaks down triglycerides into fatty acids and monoglycerides) and cholesterol into the bile. Cholesterol is absorbed by the liver and can be further broken down into bile acids. The gallbladder stores this bile until it is needed to break down fat in the duodenum. The pancreas also secretes pancreatic lip", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: How can you find out?", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

The epidermis is the outer layer of skin. When we are in the water, the epidermis is the layer of skin that gets wet. When we are out of the water, the epidermis is the layer that dries. When we take our hands out of water, the epidermis is no longer wet. The epidermis then begins to dry. When it dries, the epidermis looses water. This looses water causes the skin to wrink", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The astronauts left behind their equipment because they knew it would be too expensive to bring it back to Earth.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The water that enters the body has a tendency to become water vapor in the lungs, which has a tendency to leave the body as vapor.

In this metaphor, the future is a system whose state is completely determined by the initial conditions. Therefore, the initial conditions are the only thing that can possibly influence the future.\n\nBecause the state of the future is completely determined by the initial conditions, the future is essentially completely determined by the past. Therefore, the future is already determined.
