It is a state of unconsciousness and inactivity, from which a person cannot be awakened. It is a naturally occurring state that is characterized by a decrease in responsiveness to external stimuli, a decrease in the ability to react to external stimuli, and a reduction in movement.

Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that the more precisely you measure one property of a particle, the less precisely you can measure the other property. For example, if you have a particle with a mass m and a velocity v, you can't know exactly what its mass is and what its velocity is at the same time. You can know the mass with an uncertainty of \u03b4m, and you can know the velocity with an uncertainty of \u03b4v, but you can't know the mass with an uncertainty less than \u03b4m and the velocity with an uncertainty less than \u03b4v.\n\nHeisenberg'", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis?
