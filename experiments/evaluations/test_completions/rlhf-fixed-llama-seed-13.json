Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: I think it's because there's more water vapor. When you heat up water, it turns into a gas, and when you cool it down it turns back into a liquid. And then you release the water vapor back into the atmosphere. And when you put more water vapor in the air, you get more water vapor molecules colliding and bumping into each other and making new molecules. That's why it's wet and smelly.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?
