And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Singing requires a lot of breath and vocal control, and it is much harder to sing than speak. So when you sing, you have to use your voice in a different way than when you speak.\n\nWhen you speak, you use your voice to project your voice out into the air. When you sing, you use your voice to project your voice up into the air.\n\nTo sing, you need to use your voice to create a lot of air pressure and make your vocal cords vibrate.

The droplets become heavy and fall to the ground as rain. When water droplets are very small, they can remain suspended in the air as clouds. The droplets are too small to be seen, but they are big enough to reflect sunlight, which gives clouds their white color. \n\nClouds can be formed by water vapor condensing onto dust particles and other tiny particles in the air. These particles provide surfaces for water vapor to condense onto. Water vapor can", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: Larger animals generally have a longer lifespan than smaller animals. This is because larger animals have more energy to use up and more nutrients to consume. Larger animals have a greater mass, and therefore a greater energy content, than smaller animals. Larger animals also have a greater capacity for food intake, and so they have more energy to use. The lifespan of an animal depends on its size and its energy content. Larger animals need more energy to sustain their metabolism, and so they need more food to sustain themselves. Larger animals also need more energy to sustain their growth.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Sorry.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are a way to represent a number exactly. For example, 22.3 + 3.45 = 25.75. The 25.75 is an exact representation of the sum of the two numbers. It is important to use significant digits to represent a number exactly because it is easier to work with exact numbers than with numbers that are approximations.\n\nSignificant digits are used in many different areas of mathematics, including calculus, algebra, and statistics. They are also used in many different fields of science and engineering. For example, engineers use significant digits to", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Your liver is responsible for breaking down fat and converting it to energy. It also stores fat in the form of triglycerides, which are released into the bloodstream during digestion and used as energy. Your body uses the triglycerides to produce energy, and if your body doesn\u2019t need the energy, the triglycerides are stored in your liver for later use. The liver also produces bile, a fluid that helps break down fats.\n\nThe gallbladder stores bile, a fluid produced by the liver to help digest fat.

This means that batteries run out of power. \n\nThey also run out of power because they have a limited amount of power that they can provide. Batteries can provide power for a limited amount of time.

It is a cost-effective alternative to installing power cables to each device. \n\nPoE works by providing power over the same cable as data.

The extra power is used to power the device, and the data is used to send commands to the device.", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Colors are simply the result of light interacting with the retina. This light enters the eye through the pupil and hits the retina. The retina is the light sensitive layer at the back of the eye. It is made up of millions of cells called rods and cones. Rods are responsible for our ability to see in the dark, but they do not provide color vision. Cones are responsible for color vision, and they are sensitive to different wavelengths of light.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them because the salt causes the water in the vegetables to be released. Cut vegetables contain a lot of water, and when the salt is added to the vegetables, it causes the water to be released. \n\nThis is because salt is a compound that is made of sodium and chloride. Sodium is a solute, and chloride is a solvent. Sodium and chloride are attracted to each other. When they are together, they form a compound called salt. Salt is a compound that is", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water contains salt, which is necessary for your body to function properly.
