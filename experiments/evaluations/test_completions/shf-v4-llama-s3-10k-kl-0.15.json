I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Yes.  Let me explain.  Each coin flip is a discrete event.  It is a random variable.  It has a probability of landing heads or tails.  If you flip a coin 10 times, you expect to get 5 heads and 5 tails.  If you flip a coin 100 times, you expect to get 50 heads and 50 tails.", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Please type your question into the box, and we will do our best to answer it.\nPlease note that the information we provide is intended to educate and inform, and should not be used to make decisions about your health or to diagnose a medical condition.", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Please review our Terms of Service.
