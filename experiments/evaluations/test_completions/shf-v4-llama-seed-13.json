One of the issues is that there's not a lot of Neanderthal DNA out there, and so scientists have to be very careful about how they sequence the genome and what they do with the data.  The reason for that is that they don't want to create a Neanderthal that's not really a Neanderthal.

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: Iran is the only country in the Middle East that has laws that are friendly to transgender people.\n\nThe law requires that a transgender person must have surgery to change their sex to be recognized as the other sex. However, the law does not require that the person has the surgery before the person can change their name and gender on their national identity card.\n\nThe law also provides for a process where a transgender person can change their sex on their birth certificate.

So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: The signs are for the benefit of smaller vehicles.

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Singing is the art of projecting sound with the voice and the face to entertain an audience. When people sing, they use their lungs, vocal cords, and diaphragm to produce sound. The voice is made up of the vocal cords, which are two bands of muscle in the larynx. When people talk, the vocal cords vibrate. When people sing, the vocal cords vibrate more, and the vibrations cause the air in the lungs to move, which makes sound. The diaphragm is a large muscle under the lungs that helps the", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Clouds are made of water droplets and ice crystals.

What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are the digits of a number that are necessary to precisely represent the number. For example, 22.3 is not a precise number, because there are two digits after the decimal point. 22.300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this.
