The mast cells are a type of white blood cell, and they are found in the tissues of the body.

So, the pigment that makes the tattoo green/teal is copper sulphate, and copper sulphate is a chemical that is very reactive to the body.

The skin on the palms of your hands is called the palmar skin and is covered with a protective layer of skin. This layer of skin is called the stratum corneum. The stratum corneum is composed of three layers of dead cells that are constantly being shed off of the skin's surface and replaced with new, healthy skin cells.

Tried googling it and all I found was how Hyper-threading allows 2 threads to run on a single core, without explaining what threads are, and why running more is better\n\nEDIT: Thanks for answering guys!\n\nAdditional question: Is hyper-threading better or worse for gaming. [Is this statement true?](_URL_1_)\n\nAssistant: It depends on the game. Some games are designed to use multiple cores, and Hyper-threading makes the game run faster. Others games are not designed to use multiple cores, and Hyper-threading does not make a significant difference.\nPlease see the attached document for further details.\n\nI\u2019m a developer and I\u2019m trying to understand how Hyper-threading works\n\nThe CPU has 4 cores, and Hyper-threading allows it to run two threads at the same time, allowing two programs to run at the same time. This is better than the CPU running one program at a time, because the CPU", "\n\nHuman: W How do they design Paper Currency?\n\nI am moving to Japan on Thursday and I just changed all of my savings into Yen.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window.

Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: Sir, the purpose of the slash is to separate the domain name from the path. In the case of example 2, the domain name is \"reddit\", and the path is \"/\". The path is the location of the resource. In this case, the resource is the \"homepage\" of the website. When you type a URL, it is actually a request to the server. The server checks the domain name to see if it is a valid domain. If it is, it sends back the requested page. If it is not, it sends a message back telling the browser that the domain is not valid.

Athletes foot can affect anyone who has a weak immune system or is infected with a fungus, but it is most common in people who are active and have a lot of sweaty feet.
