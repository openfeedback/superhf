If you think of a number line as a line of points, then you're throwing the dart at a point, which is a rational number.

We have this musculature because it helps us to move our bodies and it helps us to stand upright. This is because we have a large head, we need to hold our head up, and we need to have strong musculature to keep ourselves upright.\n\nHowever, a fetus does not have this musculature. As a result, the fetus cannot move and cannot stand upright.

These were the years when young people could move away from their families and establish their own homes. Most young people had to work to be able to do this. Many young people were employed in factories and office jobs, and could not afford to travel. Others could afford to travel because their parents supported them and they did not have to work.

We require sleep everyday because our bodies are designed to sleep everyday, and it is not possible for us to skip a day of sleep. This is because our bodies need to regenerate and heal themselves.

All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: It means that a change in a system happens slowly or gradually.\n\nThis is a great example of hysteresis, which is the resistance of a system to change.\n\nFor example, if you were to turn on your heater, it would take a few minutes to reach the desired temperature.  This is because the heater has to warm the air in the room, and it takes time for that to happen.\n\nAnother example of hysteresis is how people drive.  When you first learn how to drive, it takes you a long time to get up to speed.

Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: I'd say that it's a combination of factors.\n\nFirstly, the United States was a predominantly English-speaking country until the late 18th century. The majority of the population was born in the UK and immigrated to the Americas in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nSecondly, the United States was founded on religious freedom. The Pilgrims fled England because of religious persecution. The Puritans were the original settlers of Massachusetts. They had a particular religious view that they wanted to establish.

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The reason is that, while Intel has a monopoly on the x86 ISA, AMD has a monopoly on the x86-64 ISA. So they've been able to offer 6-core CPUs for $115, while Intel has to charge ~$670 for 6-core CPUs.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Most likely due to a lack of sleep.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

Unfortunately, the symptoms are often difficult to distinguish from a variety of other conditions that don't pose a threat to the patient.\n\nIn the case of lung cancer, for example, a patient may experience a cough that becomes worse and more persistent over time. The patient may also experience shortness of breath, which can make it difficult to perform simple tasks such as walking or climbing stairs.\n\nAs the cancer progresses, patients may also experience fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, and", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand your question, but I can help you find the answer.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Middle East would be allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments.", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Well, sugar has the ability to promote tooth decay, but it also has a low Glycemic Index, which makes it less likely to cause a spike in blood sugar.", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

First, the more upvotes a post has, the higher it will be ranked on the subreddit. So, as more people vote on a post, it becomes more popular. \n\nAdditionally, each subreddit has a certain amount of \"subreddit points\". These points are assigned based on the number of subscribers a subreddit has. The more subscribers a subreddit has, the more points it gets.

Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre is a high-stakes gambler and a terrorist.

A chess game is finite because a player cannot make a move that is not on the board.  A Go game is infinite because a player can make a move that is not on the board.  Chess is played on a square board and Go is played on a rectangular board.  The difference between a square board and a rectangular board is the difference between a finite game and an infinite game.  A Go game is a 2D", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: It is possible that you have not mastered the art of Chinese cooking.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Eye muscles must contract and relax in order to focus. This process is called accommodation. When a person is looking at an object far away, the eyes must be able to focus more than when looking at objects that are closer. When looking at objects that are farther away, the muscles of the eyes must contract in order for the eyes to focus. The person's eyeballs will then change shape, which will then allow the person to focus on objects that are farther away.", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is made by bubbling carbon dioxide gas through water.", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: English is a very old language that has been influenced by many languages over the centuries. The British and Americans spell the words differently. The British spell them the way they were spelled in the middle ages. The British have not changed the spelling much, while the Americans have changed the spelling to make the words easier to pronounce. For example, Americans spell the word color, while the British spell it colour. In the middle ages, the British spelled the word with a \u201cu\u201d because the letter \u201cu\u201d was pronounced as a vowel. But, the letter \u201cu\u201d is pronounced as a conson", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I understand your question.

They pay bands to make recordings and then they own the rights to those recordings. Record labels are either indie or major.\n\nIndie labels are usually small and only have a few bands. They usually have an artist roster and will promote their bands to get them exposure. Indie labels are usually owned by one person or a small group of people. They usually do not have the same resources that major labels have. Indie labels usually have a smaller budget than a major label.\n\nM", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They use a system called a locomotive to pull the cars. They have to be able to pull the cars without breaking or derailing.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: This is a great question. Let me take a shot at this.\n\nWetness has a large surface area. This means that a small amount of liquid can spread out over a much larger surface area.\n\nWhen something is wet, it can have a much larger contact area with other surfaces. Since most molecules are in motion, they will move about as they bump into other molecules. When something is wet, these molecules are moving about much more.\n\nWhen molecules are moving about, they have a greater chance of colliding with other molecules. When they do, they may change shape,", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: This is called time dilation. It is one of the many weird things that happens to time in a black hole.\n\nThe short answer is that it is because of the effects of gravity. A massive object such as a star or black hole will distort space around it and thus space and time. When we are near the earth, space and time are distorted in the opposite direction from when we are near the sun. So when we are near the sun, we age more slowly than when we are near the earth. This is the reason that the Apollo astronauts were able to age slower than someone on earth.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is defined by the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458th of a second.  It is an arbitrary length,  but was established as the international standard of length in 1960.", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think this is a psychological effect called \"the pain of embarrassment\".

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: The reasons for the partition of Cyprus are still disputed. However, it was agreed that the island was partitioned as a result of the British leaving the country and the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities deciding to go their separate ways. The Turkish Cypriots were supported by Turkey, while the Greek Cypriots received support from Greece. The two communities have been in dispute ever since and the two are now separated by a UN buffer zone.", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: The bandwidth of a cable is limited by the technology used in the cable, which is similar to the technology used in the telephone wire.  When the frequency of the electromagnetic waves transmitted through the cable is increased, the distance between the pulses of the electromagnetic waves is increased, and the bandwidth of the cable is increased.  The theoretical maximum bandwidth is about 30 Mbps, which means that the information can be transmitted at a speed of 30 Mbps.  The practical bandwidth is limited by the noise generated by the cable, which is about", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the most efficient way to learn to play a new instrument?", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Okay, I'll try to explain it as best as I can. Let's say you flip a coin 50 times and it's always heads. \n\nThen you flip it 50 more times, and it's always heads. \n\nThen you flip it 50 more times, and it's always heads. \n\nThen you flip it 50 more times, and it's always heads. \n\nThen you flip it 50 more times, and it's always heads. \n\nThen you flip it", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun was a device that was used to control on-screen characters in many of the NES games, including Duck Hunt and Wild Gunman.\n\nThe NES light gun had a special attachment that was used to attach it to the NES controller.

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: The law is that if you are impaired by drugs or alcohol and your driving is a factor in the death of someone, then you can be charged with manslaughter or vehicular homicide.  If the police test your blood and find that you were impaired, it will be a problem for you.  This is not the same as being drunk driving.  If you are driving drunk and the police test your blood and find that you were drunk, then that is a crime.  Being impaired by drugs is not a crime if you were not driving.", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: 1. Yes, you are correct. The expression originated from the phrase \"one another man,\" where \"one another\" is the plural form of the word \"one.\" The original phrase was used to refer to a pair of people who both liked the same thing.\n\n2. \"One another\" is a correct way of saying \"one and another\" (which is also correct) because it is more common to use the expression \"one another\" than the expression \"one and another.\"\n\n3. \"One another\" is correct, but it is a little confusing because the word \"one\" refers to a", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: The plastic ones are so you don't have to worry about the toilet seat coming loose, since it's easier to use plastic to secure it to the toilet.", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by growing up?", "\n\nHuman: If there's being such serious human rights violations goiing on in Qatar, and FIFA aren't doing anything about it, then how come none of the world governments or the UN are putting pressure on something to be done?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because it's not something that's being talked about in the media.", "\n\nHuman: Sure Deposit\n\nI am being told that, despite having deposit in the name, it's just an unrelated fee.

It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, but there's no easy answer for this.  I suspect it's a combination of a number of factors.  Manga are often targeted at younger audiences, and most manga artists are young.  It's just easier for them to create stories about children.  As a result, the majority of anime and manga have children as main characters.", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It depends on the animal, but for some animals they will stay in the same position for months, sometimes even years. If this is the case, then the animals will have to find some way to breathe, as they will not be able to leave their hibernation den. Some animals that hibernate do not actually sleep, they remain in a state of low metabolism, which is called torpor. This state of torpor is different from sleep because the animal is still alert, and can move if it needs to. When the animal is in torpor, it is much easier to wake up than it is to", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: You can understand a language by hearing it and by reading it, but in order to speak a language, you need to learn the correct pronunciation, learn the grammar, learn the vocabulary, and learn how to put all the parts together.", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: Blind people use a cane to find their way around.

For example, if you are a female, you can be charged more for car insurance because statistically, women are more likely to get into car accidents than men are.  Another reason why insurance companies can discriminate is that they are allowed to charge you for things that are not directly related to your gender or race.", "\n\nHuman: What is the dust on your eyes after you wake up?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: It's called sleep", "\n\nHuman: How would a write in candidate win a national election considering that there might be and probably are other people with the exact same name?\n\nIn the context of people talking about write in candidates for this upcoming election, I was just wondering how this works.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: The candidate needs to have an office in every state, and the candidate must have a campaign team in every state.", "\n\nHuman: How did people used to train pigeons to carry mail at the long distance, back in the day?\n\nI was always curious, did they have different pigeon for each address and if not, how pigeon knows whom to send? \n\nAssistant: I guess you can get a pigeon and train it to come to a specific place and then give it a message to take to that address. \nThen you could get more pigeons and train them to return to the same place.", "\n\nHuman: Why are people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war shamed instead of admired? Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know. I think people who avoided service should not be shamed. However, the idea that people who avoided the draft were more moral than people who went to war is wrong. For one thing, it assumes that people who went to war were bad people. I don't think that's true. It also assumes that people who avoided the draft were somehow more moral than people who went to war. I don't think that's true either.", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: That is an interesting question.  I believe that the answer is yes, but I believe that it would take a few years to achieve.  You would first need to find a way to genetically modify a human egg and sperm.  The modification could be done by viruses or by gene editing.  Next, you would need to find a surrogate mother.  The surrogate mother would need to be a human female that is either infertile or has an abnormally low chance of conceiving.

First, if you make a machine that can do both of these things at the same time, it would be much heavier. If it was heavier, it would be much more expensive to transport. And then it would be much more expensive to make, because you need to make the machine much stronger. So you would have to make the machine much heavier and much more expensive. So it is a trade-off.
