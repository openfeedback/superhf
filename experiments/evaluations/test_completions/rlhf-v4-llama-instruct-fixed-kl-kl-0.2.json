This is because the U.S. Constitution only applies to federal trials when they are used to punish a crime.\n\nIn 2011, the Supreme Court rejected this argument and held that federal trials should be subject to the 6th Amendment's public trial guarantee.\n\nThe 6th Amendment guarantees a defendant a public trial. This means that a", "\n\nHuman: Why can't humans consciously control certain bodily responses and functions?\n\nFor example, (if I understand correctly) if pain is a warning that something is wrong, why can't we 'tell' our brain to stop sending those signals once we realize what it is?\n\nAssistant: The brain is complex and very difficult to understand, but it is certainly possible that at some point we will be able to control pain, and even more complex functions such as temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, etc. This is the promise of the future of medicine.\n\nIn the meantime, it is important to understand that the brain is a network of many regions that are all working together to accomplish a complex task. In the case of pain, it is important to know that the brain is not just sending a signal to the body. The brain is also receiving signals from the body. \n\nThis means that the brain", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D? Some kind of mammal photosynthesis?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The main way that humans get vitamin D is from exposure to sunlight. The human body is able to generate vitamin D when skin is exposed to sunlight. The conversion of sunlight to vitamin D takes place in the skin, and occurs when the skin is exposed to UVB light. UVB light is capable of penetrating the skin, and converting a chemical in the skin (7-dehydrocholesterol) into vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D3 is then converted into other vitamin D compounds in the liver and kidneys. A", "\n\nHuman: What makes leds flicker in videos?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: A series of events are happening, or not happening, in a short amount of time.

For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The box office, or gross, is the sum of all box office revenue. Box office revenue is the money earned from the sale of tickets to a movie. Box office revenue is determined by multiplying the number of tickets sold by the ticket price. In 2015, the average ticket price was $8.24. In 2015, the total box office revenue was $11.1 billion. The cast of a movie is paid from the movie's profits. The more money a movie makes, the more money the cast is paid. For example, the", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: The cancer rate in livestock is dependent on the breed. For example, the rate of malignant cancer is 6% in dogs and 2.6% in cats, and the rate of benign cancer is 30% in dogs and 43% in cats. The rate of malignant cancer is 14% in cattle and 10% in pigs. However, the rate of malignant cancer in poultry is only 2.9%. The rate of benign cancer is 10% in poultry.

The power of induction is more efficient at transferring energy.", "\n\nHuman: What are sensitive teeth? My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sensitive teeth are caused by enamel erosion, which exposes dentin underneath. The dentin has more nerve endings than enamel and can be sensitive to cold, heat, touch, and acidic foods. Tooth sensitivity is very common. The good news is that there are many things you can do to relieve sensitivity.\n\nThe best way to prevent sensitive teeth is to brush and floss regularly, use a soft-bristled toothbrush, and avoid acidic foods and drinks.\n\nIf you already have sensitive teeth,", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: Hair is a protein-based structure that has a lot of different components. When we don't wash our hair, these components become more concentrated, and as a result, the hair feels \"greasy\" and \"oily\". Shampoo is a surfactant that binds to the hair and removes the oils, so you can wash it away. The hair becomes less \"greasy\" and \"oily\" because the oils are washed away.\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The point of it was to restore the \"Freedom of Religion\" law. It was passed because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the state could not enforce a law that would require individuals to pay for abortions with their own money. The court held that the law was a \"substantial burden\" on the freedom of religion of the plaintiffs, who argued that abortion is a religious practice.", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The term \"supersymmetry\" was first used in 1971 by Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam in their effort to develop a unified theory of the weak and electromagnetic forces. They postulated that the weak force is mediated by the exchange of a virtual W boson, which in turn is a virtual superpartner, a spin 1/2 boson, the so-called Z boson. This theory was later called the weak supertheory.\n\nThe first experimental evidence of supersymmetry came in 1983, when the weak force was shown", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: The skin on the palm of your hands is unique in that it has a high concentration of sebaceous glands. Sebaceous glands produce sebum, an oily substance that keeps the skin moist and supple.  This oily substance protects your hands from being affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc.\n\nThis is why your palms are not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc.", "\n\nHuman: What is actually happening when your heart \"aches\"?\n\nAssistant: There are a number of causes for chest pain.

I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the short term, the muscle that spans the back of the spine is called the erector spinae, and when you pull your back, you are stretching and straining this muscle. The muscle is then sore and inflamed, causing pain and stiffness. \nIn the long term, it is not just the erector spinae that is affected by pulling your back. \n\nYour spine and the muscles that hold it together are connected by ligaments. Ligaments are strong but flexible tissue that hold things together. In the case of the back, the ligaments", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: There are a number of factors that go into determining how much a currency is worth, and whether the currency will appreciate or depreciate. Firstly, the currency's supply and demand will determine how much the currency is worth. The supply and demand for a currency are driven by the interest rates, the interest rate is set by the central bank.\n\nWhen the interest rate is higher, the currency is worth more. When the interest rate is lower, the currency is worth less.\n\nNext, the currency's supply and demand are driven by the inflation rate. When inflation is higher, the currency", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hippy culture was a counterculture movement that began in the 1960s. The hippies were known for their drug use, but they also had a strong interest in peace, music, and nature. They had a strong interest in the environment, and many of them were involved in the early environmental movement. Many hippies were also involved in the civil rights movement.

And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: The Earth's rotation is a constant, and this constant is part of a much larger cycle. We need sleep to keep our bodies healthy, but the amount of sleep we need is not constant. Sleep is important to our wellbeing, and it is important to know how much sleep we need.\n\nSleep is an important part of everyday life, and it is important to know how much sleep we need. Our bodies require a lot of sleep, and it is important to understand how much sleep we need.\n\nSleep is a very important part of our daily lives, and we need to know how", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are many things that make computers better over time. A very important one is Moore\u2019s law. Moore\u2019s law states that the number of transistors on a chip will double every two years. This is very important because the more transistors there are, the more powerful the computer is. Another thing that makes computers better over time is that the algorithms and software are improved. This makes computers faster and more efficient. One example of this is in the year 2000, the world record for a 30 second mile was 4:18:51. In 2019,", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: [removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]\n\n[removed]", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow.

How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: It is because the medication is being pushed through the tube, and it is not being absorbed into the bloodstream. So it can be tasted.\n\nEven though the medication is dissolved in normal saline, it is still not absorbed. It is not reaching the bloodstream.\n\nAdditionally, the medication is not being absorbed into the body, so it is not being tasted in the mouth. It is only being tasted in the tube.", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics which states that it is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle. It was formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927.\n\nTo understand Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we need to know what does momentum actually mean?\n\nMomentum is the quantity of motion or motion of a particle. It is defined as the product of mass and velocity. In SI units, the momentum of a particle is measured in kilogram-meters per second (kg*m/s).\n\nFor example, if a particle", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a term in physics that describes the resistance to change. It is the resistance of an object to changes in its own state, and that resistance depends on how long the object has been in its current state.\n\nThe resistance of an object to change is related to the number of molecules that are in the current state of the object. The more molecules that are in the current state of the object, the more difficult it is for the object to change its state.\n\nFor example, if you put a metal object in a magnetic field, it will take a longer time to move out of the magnetic", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: The United States has a long history of economic growth and has a high standard of living. The European Union has a much more mixed economy, and has a mixed record of growth and poverty. The United States has a federal government that is less powerful than many other countries, and the EU is a powerful government. The United States has a national identity and culture, while the EU is a loose confederation of many countries with diverse cultures.\n\nThe United States has a strong legal system, and the EU has a legal system that is less developed.

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: AMD CPUs are typically cheaper, because they are the underdog in the CPU market. The price difference between 6-core AMD CPUs and 6-core Intel CPUs is small. But it's a little different for 8-core AMD CPUs and 8-core Intel CPUs. For example, AMD's Ryzen 7 3700X costs $262.99, while Intel's 8-core Core i7-8700K costs $352.99. For $80 less, you can", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's probably because of the lack of sleep, you can also have a look at the cause of the twitching.

If you have a persistent eye twitching, you can also see your doctor, and they can give you an examination and treatment for your eye twitching.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: I think this is a realistic portrayal of what happens in real life. There is no one stage of cancer, so it's not always terminal. Cancer is a progressive disease, so the symptoms get worse as it progresses. Cancer can start in any organ and spread to others. When the tumor gets large enough to start affecting the function of the organ, the patient usually starts feeling pain. Also, cancer is not a single disease, it can be in many forms. Cancer cells can behave differently, depending on the type. Some cancers are more aggressive, some more slow", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s very hard to tell.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Calories are the key. Sugar is \"bad\" for you because it will provide your body with calories that it doesn't need.  As long as you're burning calories during the day, you will likely not gain weight.  If you consume more calories than you burn, you will gain weight.  Sugar provides an easy way to consume excess calories.  It's very easy to consume a bowl of sugar and a glass of juice.  You can easily consume 3000 calories from sugar.  The key is to be aware of how many calories", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week. However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: Yes, there are a number of reasons why they air five days a week, but the most important one is that they air on a different network. For example, if you were watching the Tonight Show, you'd see Jimmy Fallon on a different network, usually NBC. If you were watching the Late Late Show, you'd see James Corden on a different network, usually CBS.

One of the things that make it complex is that it has two parts.  The front part of the eye is the cornea.  The cornea is a clear dome shape which helps to focus light.  The back part of the eye is called the retina.  The retina is the part that captures the light coming into the eye.  It converts the light into nerve impulses that are sent to the brain.  The brain then interprets the nerve impulses as images.  The cornea and the retina are connected by the", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It starts with a water source, carbon dioxide is then added to the water.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: I'm not a fartologist, but I know that smell is a combination of things. The thing that makes it smell the worst is that it's moisture that's trapped in a space, so it can't evaporate. The more water that's in a space, the worse it smells. The reason it smells like a wet dog is because it's a mixture of many different things, and the wet dog smell is probably the worst of them all.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: When you move to a new location in the galaxy, the time is still the same as it was on Earth. So, if you were to travel 20 light years away from the Earth, it would take you 20 years to get there. This means that a year on Earth would be 20 years on that planet.\n\nIf you were to return to the Earth after 20 years, it would take you another 20 years to travel back to Earth. So, if you were to bring a stopwatch, it would show you that you had been gone for 40 years.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is a unit of length.

The gravitational influence of the planet is very weak, which is why it hasn't been discovered yet. It's possible that the planet is in a strange orbit, which could explain why it's so hard to find.

A washing machine is designed to move the clothes around a lot. It spins the clothes and soaks them in water. A dryer does the opposite. It takes the clothes that are wet and then heats them up to get rid of the water. The clothes that are wet and dry are different. You can't do both at the same time.
