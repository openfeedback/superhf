I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that there is a big difference between a \u201cvaccine\u201d and a \u201cmedicine\u201d.

I can\u2019t be sure how much wood a woodchuck can chuck, but I can tell you that it\u2019s a lot!  The woodchuck is an omnivore, meaning that it eats both plants and animals, so I\u2019m guessing that the woodchuck has an impressive digestive system and can digest almost anything.

How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a box office expert, but I can tell you that Interstellar\u2019s budget was $165 million, but it only made $173 million at the box office.  The difference between the two is called the \u201cprofit margin\u201d or the \u201cgross profit margin\u201d.  This means that the producers of the film made a profit of $8 million.  It\u2019s not unusual for a film to make a profit of this size.  In fact, according to Box Office Mojo, Interstellar is one of the top 50 most", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor. I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m sorry to say that I don\u2019t know what the cancer rate for livestock is, but I do know that livestock are routinely given antibiotics and other drugs to keep them healthy and prevent disease, and these drugs can be quite toxic.  I don\u2019t know what the cancer rate for livestock is, but I do know that the rate for humans is pretty high, and some people think that eating meat is linked to cancer.", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops. If I was to cut it in half, how would it know to start growing again?\n\nAssistant: Yes, it would start growing back.", "\n\nHuman: How do wireless phone chargers work\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201cwork\u201d here. Do you mean how they charge your phone?  Or do you mean how they communicate with the phone?", "\n\nHuman: What are sensitive teeth? My teeth hurt sometimes but my dentist tells me I have no cavities.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m sorry to hear about your pain!  I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s causing it, but it\u2019s a common problem, and I\u2019m not an expert on it.  Maybe you could ask your dentist to refer you to a specialist, or to a specialist in pain management?  And I can help you find a dentist who is an expert in sensitive teeth.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: There are two main reasons why hair feels greasy. The first is that the hair follicles produce an oily substance called sebum. This sebum is released from the follicles and onto the surface of the hair, causing it to feel greasy. The second reason is that hair absorbs sebum from the skin, which is also oily.\n\nThe second reason is more difficult to understand, but it's related to how the skin and the hair follicles are connected. The skin is made up of layers of cells that are constantly being replaced. The cells that are closest to the surface of", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it? How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a law that requires government to have a compelling reason to infringe on religious beliefs. It\u2019s a response to a court case that determined that a person\u2019s religious beliefs cannot be used as an excuse for not following a law that the government passed.", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry is a theory about the fundamental building blocks of the universe.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: The palms of our hands are different from the rest of our skin because they are very thin and have a lot of nerves.  There are many tiny blood vessels in the palm of our hands, so it\u2019s easy for the blood to flow out of the skin, and that makes it harder for the skin to become irritated.  Because the skin on our palms is so thin, it\u2019s easier for skin cells to come off, and that\u2019s why we get eczema.  But we don\u2019t get it on our palms because the skin there is so thin.\n\nH", "\n\nHuman: What is actually happening when your heart \"aches\"?\n\nAssistant: Heartache is when your heart feels sad or unhappy.

I\u2019m not a medium or a psychic or anything like that.  But I\u2019d be happy to help you with any other questions you have about science.", "\n\nHuman: Why are peanuts so much more affordable than other nuts?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Peanuts are the cheapest nuts, and that\u2019s because they\u2019re a legume, not a nut.  Nuts are the most expensive kind of nut.  But peanuts are also the least expensive kind of nut.  So, peanuts are cheap, and nuts are expensive.  That\u2019s why they\u2019re the cheapest and most expensive nuts, respectively.  Nuts are the most expensive nuts, and peanuts are the cheapest nuts.", "\n\nHuman: How do compression shorts and compression tights help athletes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Compression shorts and compression tights can help athletes by increasing blood flow to the muscles, which helps to speed up recovery.  They also help to reduce muscle fatigue by providing support.  Compression shorts and tights are also known to help reduce muscle soreness and recovery time.", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens when you pull your back? I mean the common back issue where you awkwardly pick something up or cough in a weird position and cause back pain for a few days.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t have any specific information on what causes back pain, but I\u2019m sure the answer is not as simple as \u201cpulling your back\u201d.  There are many causes of back pain, and often it\u2019s not clear what the cause is, and it may be a combination of factors.  One possible cause is a muscle strain or spasm in the back, which can occur because of a sudden movement.  Another possible cause is a slipped disc, which can occur if you have a long-term problem with your back, and over time the disc between the vertebrae gets weaker and can", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: A currency\u2019s value is determined by how much people in the country want to hold that currency.  When people want to hold more of a currency, its value goes up.  If people want to hold less, its value goes down.  The supply/demand for a currency is determined by how much of that currency is held by the central bank, and by how much of that currency is held by the people.", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think they mostly did it by living in communes, and sharing resources.", "\n\nHuman: Why are our bodies programmed to sleep based on the earths rotation?\n\n Let me clarify, why do we sleep every night, which is just perfect enough for us to function during the day. And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: I think that the answer is that we need to sleep to recharge our batteries.  If we didn\u2019t sleep, our bodies would be running out of energy.  And if we had more energy, we would be able to do more things during the day.  So, I think that it\u2019s a good thing that our bodies have a built-in system to make sure we sleep enough, so that we don\u2019t run out of energy.", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I think the answer is that the technology of computing has improved over time, and we\u2019ve learned more about how to make computers do more and more things.  For example, the first computers were only able to perform simple calculations, but now we\u2019re able to do much more advanced calculations and much more complex tasks.  The human brain also gets better over time, and as a result we\u2019re able to do more complicated tasks.  So we\u2019re able to make better computers, and better brains.", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you mean.  The result of 1*10^99 is 10^100.  This is a very large number, but it\u2019s still a finite number.  I\u2019m not sure what you mean by 10*10^99.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s not clear if there\u2019s a relationship between chewing and gas, but chewing can definitely make it easier to swallow food.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to not chew your food, because it can make it harder for your body to absorb the nutrients.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re asking.  Are you asking how a patient can taste a drug that\u2019s being infused?  Or are you asking why a patient might taste something in the IV fluid?", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me.

Can you be more specific?", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: OK, so let\u2019s start by explaining what hysteresis is.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".  Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.  Do you mean why is Europe more socially liberal than the US?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a well-known phenomenon that\u2019s been studied by psychologists and neuroscientists for many years. There\u2019s a lot of evidence that shows that this is a reflexive behavior, and is the result of a response to a low oxygen supply in the brain.  It\u2019s also been suggested that this behavior could be related to the fact that our brain is about 80% water, and that our brain could be getting dehydrated.  This could be causing the urge to rub our eyes.  The urge to rub our eyes could also be a response", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: I can explain it like this.  AMD and Intel are competing in the same market, and have some overlap in their product lines.  One of the ways they are different is that Intel tends to focus on higher-end products, with more cores and more expensive.  AMD tends to focus on lower-end products, with fewer cores and cheaper.  The difference in the price of the products reflects this difference in marketing focus.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s an interesting question.  I\u2019m not sure I know the answer, but let me ask you this: do you ever get eye twitches?", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day. How realistic is this?\n\nI'm gonna guess not at all. It's always so weird when charachter A goes to the doctor, \n\n\"Oh, I have this mild irritation I'm concenred about.\"\n\n\"Sorry you actually have end stage  > insert organ here <  cancer, you'll die in 6 months\"\n\nIn those six months, they live like nothing is wrong. traveling, having fun with relatives, all that jazz, until one day:\n\n\"Oh no, I have serious problem in my  > insert cancer related organ here < !\" **Dies.**\n\nI have a hard time believing this is even close to reality.\n\nAssistant: I'd say that it's pretty close to reality. Cancer is a progressive disease, so it's unlikely that you'd have a terminal diagnosis with no symptoms.  Also, there are many different types of cancer, so it's hard to generalize about what symptoms you'd have, or how long you'd live.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I can\u2019t really answer that question.  I think it might be because the human voice is a very complex sound, and it\u2019s hard to recreate that in a recording.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think that\u2019s a difficult question to answer.  It would be a different Middle East, but I\u2019m not sure what kind of difference it would make.  There would probably be fewer conflicts, but I\u2019m not sure what the net result would be.", "\n\nHuman: Why is sugar \"bad\" for me?\n\nAll I have ever heard people say when I ask why sugar is bad is that \"it has a lot of calories\".\n\nI'm a person who exercises quite a lot, so usually I need to consume 3000-3500 calories per day just to maintain my weight.  So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Yes, sugar is calorie dense, but it also provides a lot of energy for the body.  So the question is, are you getting enough calories for your activity level?", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week. However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: The American talk show hosts are famous for their rambling monologues.  A show that airs once a week would be too short for them to have enough time to tell all of their stories.  I think this is why they air five days a week.", "\n\nHuman: Origin of \"In Mother Russia...\" jokes\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I think they are a kind of Russian joke, but I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a specific origin story.", "\n\nHuman: Colloidal silver?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I don\u2019t know what that is.", "\n\nHuman: Why do you \"drive\" a car, but \"pilot\" a boat, plane, etc.?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a difference of perspective. When you\u2019re in a boat, you can see what\u2019s going on around you. But when you\u2019re in a car, you can\u2019t see much of anything.  You\u2019re more in a \u201cdriver\u2019s seat\u201d than a \u201cpilot\u2019s seat\u201d.", "\n\nHuman: Why do popular reddit posts tend to cap out around 4k up votes when there is such a big amount of people using reddit?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The popularity of a post is largely determined by its content, and the content of a post is determined by the context in which it was written.  This makes it difficult to make a direct comparison between different posts, because the contexts vary so much.  You can compare posts to each other, but not across different contexts.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think it would just crush itself.  I don\u2019t think there are any materials that are harder than the material it is trying to break through.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the Xbox One need a brick in between the outlet plug and the console where as the PS4 doesn't?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The PS4 doesn't need it because the PS4 has a different power supply.  The PS4 uses a standard 110V AC power supply, which is the same as a home outlet, so there's no need for a brick.  The Xbox One, on the other hand, has a special power supply that's designed for use in a TV, so it needs a brick.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chlorophyll green and not black?\n\nWouldn't black pigment absorb more light? \n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you mean.  Chlorophyll is green because it absorbs light at the red end of the spectrum, which is why it looks green.", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I think that\u2019s a great question.  I don\u2019t think there is a simple answer.  The question is:  Does the presence of THC, or the metabolites of THC, in a person\u2019s blood or urine indicate that the person has used marijuana or other cannabis-derived substances?  I\u2019m not sure.  I\u2019m also not sure how the question is relevant to the study of runners high.  Can you clarify what you\u2019re looking for?", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think you mean \"viscosity\", not \"viscous\".  Viscosity is a measure of how \"thick\" the liquid is.  It's measured by how much it resists flow, and how much effort it takes to move it.  If it becomes too thick, it's no longer considered a liquid, and you would say it's \"gelled\".", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: The Skyfleet stock was down, and Le Chiffre was trying to make it go up, so he could sell his stocks at a profit.", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: A mouse is a device that emits ultrasonic sound waves, which are then picked up by a microphone on the computer.  The computer then interprets this sound as a mouse-click.  In the same way, the computer sends out ultrasonic sound waves, which are picked up by a microphone in the monitor.  The computer then interprets this sound as a mouse-click.", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure.", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think it\u2019s because people believe that circumcision is a healthier and cleaner way of life than uncircumcised, and because they feel that it is a more important part of a Jewish or Muslim culture than it is a part of an American culture.", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This is an interesting question! In the case of Go, the board is a grid of cells, each of which has a unique number.  The number of possible configurations of the board is the number of ways that the numbers can be assigned to the cells.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: I think it might be because you\u2019re not cooking in the same way as a restaurant.  There are a lot of techniques that a restaurant chef uses that you don\u2019t have access to when you cook at home.  For example, restaurants tend to have better-quality ingredients, and they\u2019re also able to use a lot of the same techniques that professional chefs use, such as sauteing, blanching, and stir-frying.  They can also use a lot of different ingredients, and they have a lot more space to cook, and they\u2019re more sk", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a good question. The answer has to do with the way the eye works.  It\u2019s like this:\n\nThe human eye is a complex and delicate instrument.  It has to work very hard to perceive the world around us.  It\u2019s made of many parts, and one of the most important parts is the lens.  The lens is a little like a magnifying glass, and it is designed to make things look bigger.  It does this by bending the light rays that enter it.  The lens is also designed to be very clear, so that the", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is made by dissolving carbon dioxide in water, which increases the water\u2019s acidity.  It\u2019s also known as soda water or sparkling water.", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Americans spell their words differently to British English because they are not British.  The pronunciation of herb is the same in both the US and UK, but Americans pronounce the H in the word color.", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure.  I\u2019ll try to think of some possible explanations.  One idea is that the temperature of the water is controlled by a device called a \u201cthermostat\u201d that has a small motor inside.  When the shower is turned on, the motor starts up, which means it\u2019s working harder, and so it\u2019s getting hotter.  The motor might also be getting hotter, and if it\u2019s getting hotter, it\u2019s going to be less efficient, so it\u2019s going to make the water get warmer even faster.", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014. What has happened during the last 12 months? Is the situation better or worse?\n\nAssistant: ISIS was formed in 2004, and has since grown into a large terrorist organization. The group is active in Syria and Iraq, and has spread to other countries. In Syria and Iraq, ISIS has attacked and killed civilians, including women and children, and has controlled territory. ISIS has also attacked and killed civilians in other countries, including Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Turkey. In addition, ISIS has attacked civilians in other countries, including Jordan, Tunisia, and Libya.", "\n\nHuman: How does having a record label help bands, and how would an indie label differ from a major label?\n\nI've searched this many times but have yet to get a clear answer. anyone have a simple explanation that could be a little more clear?\n\nAssistant: Oh, that\u2019s a complicated question.  Let me try to explain.  A record label is a company that manages the careers of musicians and bands.  It will help them produce their music and market their music and distribute it.  It will also try to get them gigs, and help them get paid.  A record label is often a business, so it will also make money from the musicians.  The bigger the label, the more money it makes.  A record label is often run by a manager, who has a lot of control over what happens with the musicians.  A", "\n\nHuman: How do trains pull so many cars? What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know what you mean by \u201cpull\u201d. Are you asking about how much weight a train can pull, or how fast it can go?", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a good question.  I\u2019ll have to do some research to answer this.  What do you think?", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: I think it is a combination of evaporated water and bacteria.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator that is currently the world\u2019s largest and most powerful.  It\u2019s located in Switzerland and is operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).  The LHC is used to study the fundamental building blocks of matter, and to understand the way the universe evolved over time.  The LHC is also used to study the fundamental forces of nature, including the weak force and the strong force.  It is hoped that the LHC will also be able to discover the Higgs Boson, which is a", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m the best person to answer this question, but I\u2019ll try to give you some insight into the subject.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: You seem to be thinking about time travel, which is a really interesting topic.  I\u2019m not sure I understand the question.  Do you mean that you want to know how long you would stay in the future, if you traveled to a distant galaxy and then returned to Earth?", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter was introduced in 1793, and the original definition was based on the length of a pendulum that had a period of 1/2 second, which is a value that is now called the second.  The meter was originally defined as one ten-millionth of the distance between the north pole and the equator.  Since the earth is not a perfect sphere, this definition was not accurate.  In 1983, the meter was redefined as the distance between two lines on the surface of a platinum-iridium bar.  This is still not an", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s probably because when you\u2019re little, you\u2019re less sensitive to pain.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201cconfirm\u201d, but I think you mean the \u201cPlanet Nine\u201d.  Scientists can\u2019t confirm it because they haven\u2019t observed it, but they can observe many of the other planets in the Solar System.  The planet Nine, or \u201cPlanet X\u201d as it\u2019s sometimes called, is a hypothetical planet that might exist in a distant part of the Solar System.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what sense you\u2019re referring to.  Are you trying to say that it\u2019s a bad thing that a new black widow spider will kill and eat its mate?  Or that it\u2019s a good thing?", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They\u2019re both fruits, and they\u2019re both sweet, so that\u2019s why they\u2019re both attractive to animals.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure how to answer this question.  Could you be more specific?", "\n\nHuman: Why is it quicker for me to copy and paste a link from MS Word to my browser than for me to click on it in Word and have it open in the browser?\n\nWhat are the technical steps that cause Word to slow down exporting the link?\n\nAssistant: Hmm, that\u2019s a really good question.  I\u2019m not sure I understand what you mean by \u201cslow down\u201d.  What do you mean by \u201cslow down\u201d?  If I\u2019m understanding you correctly, what you\u2019re saying is that it\u2019s faster for you to copy and paste the link, than for you to click on it and have it open in the browser.  And you\u2019re saying that the reason for that is that there\u2019s a \u201ctechnical step\u201d that\u2019s slowing down the exporting of the link?

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: I think you\u2019re referring to the Cyprus conflict, which has been going on since 1974. The UN has been involved in this conflict, and it\u2019s still ongoing.  There\u2019s a UN peacekeeping force there.  There are two separate \u201cstates\u201d: the Greek Cypriot Republic of Cyprus, which is a member of the European Union, and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is not.  The Republic of Cyprus is recognized as an independent state by most countries, but Turkey does not recognize it, and does not recognize the UN", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: Well, it\u2019s complicated. There are a lot of different factors at play, but the biggest one is that, if you\u2019re a child, you\u2019re less likely to be buried.  You\u2019re more likely to be a casualty of war, or to die in a fire, or to get lost or eaten by animals.  Or you\u2019re more likely to be left to die in the wilderness.  And then you\u2019re less likely to be found and preserved.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: You mean why do male humans and female humans look different?  I think it\u2019s because the body plan for males and females is different.  It\u2019s not because one gender is better than the other.", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.

How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There were no alarm clocks, because the human body is a natural alarm clock.  The body is designed to wake up at a certain time, usually in the morning.  And so people just got up at that time, and went about their daily activities.  This was called the \u201cnatural sleep cycle\u201d or the \u201ccircadian rhythm\u201d.  People today still use the same natural sleep cycle, but in modern times, they can also use alarm clocks to wake up at a specific time.  This is a good example of how humans can use machines to help them.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I understand what you mean by \u201cbetter for someone to predict that the next flip will be tails\u201d.  Would you please explain?", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun was a plastic gun that was used to point at the TV screen.  The gun had a small light bulb in it, and the TV screen was lit by a lightbulb as well.  The TV screen also had a little sensor that would detect the light from the lightbulb in the gun.  When the gun pointed at the screen, the sensor would turn off the TV screen\u2019s lightbulb, and the screen would only show the light from the gun.  This is how the NES light gun worked.", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s not clear what you mean by \u201cdeport\u201d and \u201cno records\u201d.  I can try to understand what you mean by this, but it\u2019s not clear to me what you mean.", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you mean by that, could you rephrase?", "\n\nHuman: why does comcast Internet slow down despite offering 20+mbps\n\nAssistant: The Internet is not a physical thing, and the speed you\u2019re getting is the speed of your connection.  I don\u2019t know if this is relevant, but you may have an old modem.  Can you tell me what kind of modem you have?", "\n\nHuman: how do apps like prankdial work?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know the exact details, but they use the internet to connect to a phone number, then use the phone to make a call.", "\n\nHuman: What actually happens if you ignore medical bills? [USA]\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Ignoring a medical bill will not make it go away.  You will still need to pay it, and if you do not pay it, the bill will eventually be sent to a collection agency, which will then take legal action to collect the debt.", "\n\nHuman: If I smoke pot, and a week later get in a car accident where someone dies, will i go to prison?\n\nI know whenever someone is seriously injured or killed in a car accident, both drivers blood are taken to check for intoxication.  Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?  Would it be an accident, or manslaughter? \n\nI want to make a point too, I'm talking about a car accident that is not your fault at all. \nFor example;\nYour driving the speed limit when someone pulls out right in front of you at the last second and you t-bone them. \n\nAssistant: I think that depends on the state you\u2019re in.  In some states, if you\u2019re found to have been high while driving, it\u2019s treated the same as being drunk driving.", "\n\nHuman: how was the expression \"one another\" derived? Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense. Is that where the expression was derived from, and over time it just came to be misspelled (like eek name to nickname)? Or does the expression \"one another\" actually make grammatical sense? And if so, how?\n\nThanks in advance, people of Reddit!\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure of the etymology of the expression, but I know it\u2019s a common one.  I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know how to parse it grammatically, so I\u2019m going to have to ask you.  Could you elaborate on what you mean by \u201cone and other\u201d?  Do you mean \u201cone and another\u201d?  Or \u201cone and the other\u201d?", "\n\nHuman: Why do toilet seats come with plastic bolts and wing nuts when metal ones would stop them from coming loose?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a good question! I think it\u2019s because metal bolts are harder to use than plastic ones, so it\u2019s easier to just leave them off.", "\n\nHuman: Growing up.\n\nYeah I know this sounds like something out of /r/im14andthisisdeep, but I've so many people on this site who can put into words what I cannot and explain things in a beautiful way.\n\nSo have at it; what's your explanation of growing up?\n\nAssistant: I can't answer your question directly, because I don't know what you're asking for.  I can just offer some general advice:", "\n\nHuman: If there's being such serious human rights violations goiing on in Qatar, and FIFA aren't doing anything about it, then how come none of the world governments or the UN are putting pressure on something to be done?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t give a detailed answer to your question.  I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201chuman rights violations\u201d, but I can try to answer your question in general terms.  The answer is that there are many different human rights issues in the world, and some of them are more important than others.  Sometimes it\u2019s hard to decide what\u2019s the most important issue to focus on.", "\n\nHuman: Sure Deposit\n\nI am being told that, despite having deposit in the name, it's just an unrelated fee.  I'm having trouble finding information on sure deposit, it seems like I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nAssistant: Can you provide more context?  What is your bank?  What is the service you\u2019re trying to use?", "\n\nHuman: If viruses such as Ebola have no cure, how come some people recover from the disease?\n\nHow come the virus doesn't keep multiplying until it kills the person?\n\nAssistant: I don't know if there is a cure for Ebola, but I can tell you that Ebola is an RNA virus, which means that it is not a DNA virus.  DNA viruses are very stable, so they can continue to replicate forever.  RNA viruses are not stable, and they are not able to replicate forever.  So, there may be a cure, but it\u2019s not a cure that would be able to stop the virus from replicating forever.", "\n\nHuman: Why is waking up in the mornings so difficult/dreadful?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I can\u2019t speak to the specific experience of you or anyone else.  I can, however, say that my own experience of waking up in the morning is often difficult.  I have found that I have trouble concentrating or thinking about anything at all for the first few minutes after waking up.  I have found that this is especially true if I wake up in the middle of the night.  After that, my mood improves, and I find myself more able to focus.  I have also found that the more I wake up during the night, the more likely I am to have this problem", "\n\nHuman: Why do pupils dilate on drugs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Dilated pupils are a sign that the nervous system is reacting to stimuli.  That can mean many things, including that the body is under stress, but also that the person is excited or happy.", "\n\nHuman: Why do most men go bald, in spite of all the testosterone?\n\nI'm 25, I have a full beard, I have new hair coming out on my back and shoulders but the hair on top of my head have started falling.

Ads do get smarter. \n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by \"rules\" in this context.  Can you elaborate?", "\n\nHuman: the mechanism allowing or causing flowers to track the sun as it moves across the sky.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: the mechanism that allows flowers to track the sun is called heliotropism, which means that they turn toward the sun.", "\n\nHuman: why does so many people hate the Baby boomer generation?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand your question.

Or whether men and women are attracted to different things? Or something else?", "\n\nHuman: We have vitamin A , B, C, D, E and K but not F, G, H, I and J. Why?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Vitamins A, B, C, D, E and K are all water soluble vitamins. They are water soluble because they are not very stable in the body, and they need to be dissolved in water in order to be absorbed by the body. Vitamins F, G, H, I and J are fat soluble vitamins. They are fat soluble because they are very stable in the body, and they do not need to be dissolved in water in order to be absorbed.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that sometimes I can poop with perfection only needing to wipe once and other times I need to wipe multiple times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I understand the question.  Could you rephrase?", "\n\nHuman: What Is the Chomsky Grammar Heirarchy and How Does It Work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Chomsky grammar hierarchy is a set of four levels of grammar, with each level built on the previous one.  The first level is a set of \u201crules\u201d that describe how words can be combined to form sentences.  The second level is a set of \u201crules\u201d that describe how sentences can be combined to form phrases.  The third level is a set of \u201crules\u201d that describe how phrases can be combined to form clauses.  The fourth level is a set of \u201crules\u201d that describe how clauses can be combined to form sentences.", "\n\nHuman: why almost every japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children\n\nI have just noticed this trend tbh and i never wondered why this was. It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing.

What do you think about it?", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernation is a special form of sleep, but it\u2019s not the same as regular sleep. Hibernation is a special kind of sleep that\u2019s like a kind of suspended animation.  Hibernating animals don\u2019t just sleep in one position, but they actually move around in their sleep, and they\u2019re actually quite active, even though they don\u2019t appear to be.  And they\u2019re not actually sleeping, they\u2019re actually in a state of suspended animation.  They\u2019re not conscious, but they can be awakened.", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Speaking a language is a skill that requires many years of practice and study, while understanding a language is more a question of knowledge.  This is because the brain has to learn to understand a language\u2019s grammar and structure.  You have to know how to conjugate verbs and use the correct verb tenses, and learn the vocabulary and sentence structure.  For example, if you understand the rules for conjugating verbs and the verb tenses, you can then learn the conjugations of all the verbs in the language.  The more you practice, the better you get.  Once you understand the", "\n\nHuman: How do blind people know where to feel for braille?\n\nI noticed that a lot of signs, elevators, etc. have braille writing and I was just wondering how blind people find them in the first place?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know what braille is, but I do know that blind people use the braille alphabet.  I\u2019m not sure why they would need to feel for it, though.  Wouldn\u2019t braille be a tactile experience?  But I do know that if there\u2019s a braille symbol, it will have a physical shape.  So if there\u2019s a braille symbol on a sign, I would imagine that the blind person could feel for it.  But I\u2019m not sure why they would need to feel for it.  It\u2019s not like they can\u2019t see", "\n\nHuman: What volume of water is required to drown a human?\n\nAnd a second, slightly sillier question, can someone drown swallowing only a mouthful of water?\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a great question.

I think I\u2019ll do some research and get back to you.", "\n\nHuman: what is the reason for those few extra blank white pages in the back of a book?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hmmm, this is a good question!  I\u2019m not sure if I have a good answer.  It could be that the publisher has left some space for the author to write in notes, or it could be that they\u2019re just trying to make the book seem longer.  I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m right, but I think I\u2019m close!", "\n\nHuman: Meditation\n\nHow do I do it? What does it do? Does it actually work?\n\nAssistant: Meditation is a practice that includes techniques to cultivate a calm mind and a sense of well-being.

Meditation is also practiced in many other religious traditions, such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.", "\n\nHuman: Why can insurance companies charge based on race/sex/age and not be sued for discrimination?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201cinsurance companies\u201d and \u201csued for discrimination\u201d.

If it\u2019s a presidential election, you might want to find out if there\u2019s already a candidate from your party, or if there are any other candidates who have a name that\u2019s similar to yours.  If there\u2019s no candidate that matches your name, you might be able to find out more about the voters by looking at their demographics, their age, their geographic location, and what they\u2019re interested in.  You might also want to look at the", "\n\nHuman: How did people used to train pigeons to carry mail at the long distance, back in the day?\n\nI was always curious, did they have different pigeon for each address and if not, how pigeon knows whom to send? \n\nAssistant: Well, we don\u2019t know exactly how it was done.  But it\u2019s pretty clear that the pigeons were trained to respond to a specific human voice, and then to deliver messages to specific people.", "\n\nHuman: Why are people who managed to avoid serving in the US/Viet Nam war shamed instead of admired? Wasn't it a good thing to not participate in what was obviously a bad idea?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I can\u2019t speak for other people, but I\u2019m a little surprised that you\u2019re asking this question.  It\u2019s not like people who avoided the draft were the only ones who were opposed to the Vietnam War.  I\u2019m sure that people who didn\u2019t go to the war were proud of themselves, and felt that they had done the right thing.", "\n\nHuman: With the Neanderthal genome sequenced, how can scientists bring one back into existence?\n\nMy understanding is that multiple full Neanderthal genomes have been sequenced.  I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: So, what do you think?", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have a definition for that, but I\u2019m happy to help you find the answer.

Or do you mean a person who identifies as transgender or transsexual, but also has a different gender than the one they were born with?", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: If you mean why people like smoking marijuana, that\u2019s probably because it makes them feel good.  If you mean why they like smoking it, that\u2019s because it makes them feel good.  If you mean why people like smoking it, that\u2019s probably because it makes them feel good.  If you mean why they like smoking it, that\u2019s probably because it makes them feel good.  If you mean why people like smoking it, that\u2019s probably because it makes them feel good.

The color of meat is also a natural pigment, but it\u2019s a different pigment that is less easily destroyed.  This is why when you cook meat it turns brown, and when you cook shrimp it turns orange.  The pigment that is destroyed in shrimp is called astaxanthin, and the pigment that is destroyed in meat is called myoglobin.", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I understand what you mean.

Are you interested in learning about the topic?", "\n\nHuman: Why are American politics becoming more and more polarized?\n\nAlso, is this happening in other countries?\n\nAssistant: American politics have become more polarized over time, but I think it\u2019s also important to consider the difference between the political system in the US, which is a democracy, and the political system in other countries, which are not.  It\u2019s not really possible for a democracy to have a non-polarized political system, since a democracy is about the right of citizens to participate in the political process, and in order to do that you need to be able to vote for a candidate, which means that you need to have some idea of what candidates are available.  In a non-democracy,", "\n\nHuman: Bullet Board System or BBS\n\nAs I understand it, a BBS was sort of like a local usenet/irc hybrid but only for neighborhoods?

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: That's a good question. I'm not sure what the source of the views are. I think it's more likely that the views are more of a cultural thing than a religious thing.", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: Depression is a common side effect of many medications, which can be caused by a variety of different factors.  For example, many medications cause drowsiness, and this can make a person feel depressed.  Other drugs can cause muscle aches or pain, which can also make a person feel depressed.  If you take a certain medicine for a long time, it can also make you feel depressed.", "\n\nHuman: - What makes Oceans, Lakes, Rivers, etc blue/green\n\nIsnt water clear? Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: I can tell you some things about water.  First, the water is blue and green because of the light from the sun and the sky.  The blue and green are mixed with the other colors in the light, like the red and yellow, and they mix together.  The water is mostly clear, but some water is a bit cloudy.  In the ocean, there are some algae and other sea creatures that make it look cloudy.  Some people call it \u201csea foam.\u201d  In rivers and lakes, the water can be cloudy because there is a lot of sediment in it", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't know, but I'm guessing that the zapper is a low-power device that uses infrared light, and that it's not compatible with modern TVs.  I'm not an expert on this, but I think it's because the NES zapper uses infrared light, and modern TVs use a different kind of light, called RGB light, and the infrared light is not compatible with the RGB light.  If you want to do something with the NES zapper, you could try to modify it so that it uses RGB light, and", "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between 32 and 64bit computer systems, and why aren't there, say 128bit systems.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are 32-bit systems, and 64-bit systems.  The main difference is that 32-bit systems can only address 4 gigabytes of RAM, and 64-bit systems can address 8 gigabytes.", "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer to that question is that it\u2019s not actually possible to unfreeze frozen applications in Windows.  However, what you can do is open Task Manager and then hit Ctrl-Alt-Delete again, which will cause the system to \u201creboot\u201d.  This can be useful in some situations, but it is not something that should be done very often.", "\n\nHuman: How will new gun laws prevent mass shootings?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure.  I\u2019m sure it will be an improvement, but I don\u2019t know the details.  Can you tell me more about what you\u2019re trying to accomplish?", "\n\nHuman: Why do banks offer interest? What\u2019s in it for them?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure, but I think it has to do with the fact that banks are essentially financial institutions.  They take in money from depositors and loan it to borrowers.  The interest is a way to pay for the risk that the borrower might not pay back the loan.  It\u2019s a way to make the loan worthwhile for the bank.  But it\u2019s also a way for the bank to earn some extra money, and to make a profit.  It\u2019s also a way for banks to get more money from people who don\u2019t have a lot of money to spare.", "\n\nHuman: Are present levels of income inequality in America historically unprecedented or part of a larger pattern?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I would say that the current levels of income inequality in the United States are a historical anomaly.  The Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, has been steadily increasing since the 1980s, but the last few years have seen an unprecedented rise in the Gini coefficient, which suggests that this trend is not a temporary aberration but a long-term shift.  This is probably due to the effects of globalization and technological change.", "\n\nHuman: Why do freeway overpasses have signs telling people going under the height of the bridge? If your in a semi going 55mph, and too tall, by the time you can read the sign, you wouldn't be able to stop?\n\nWhat is the point of displaying the height of an overpass for people driving under the overpass? If you are in a semi and your trailer is 16 feet tall, when traveling at freeway speeds, by the time you see [this sign,](_URL_0_) it would be too late to stop... So what are those signs for? \n\nAssistant: Good question.

I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: Hmm, that's a good question.  I'm not sure how to answer it, but I have a few thoughts.  First, I don't think the fireworks were the cause of his death.  It was the shell.  I think the shell was the cause of his death, and the fireworks were just the mechanism.  I think the shell exploded, and that was what killed him.  I think the explosion caused his head to be burned, and that's why he died.  If I'm correct, then the fireworks just ignited the shell, not the", "\n\nHuman: Why are noises louder during winter?\n\nI live near a train line, and as the weather gets cooler, the trains get louder. This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: The train is moving faster, so it has more air resistance.  The air pressure at the front of the train is lower than the pressure at the back of the train, which creates a sort of vacuum.  The engine of the train sucks in the air from the vacuum, and the engine is louder because of this.  The sound is louder when it\u2019s colder because there\u2019s less air resistance.  It\u2019s like the train\u2019s engine is sucking in the air faster, and the sound is louder because of this.", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: Is that correlation due to the fact that liberalism is associated with education?", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: It's because of the way they use their mouths to make sounds.  I think the reason Adele sounds different when she sings is because she's using her voice differently.  I think other people's voices sound different when they sing because they're using different parts of their vocal cords.", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Clouds are made of tiny droplets of water.  The droplets are small enough to be moved around by the wind, but they are still too big to be blown away by the wind.  So the droplets don\u2019t move very much, but the wind still blows them around, which makes the clouds move around.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, that\u2019s a great question!  I\u2019m not sure I can answer it, but I think it\u2019s because a larger animal has a larger body mass, so it can support more cells, and therefore needs more energy to support its cells, and this takes a greater amount of energy, so it takes more time to get enough food to support that many cells.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we call our parents mom and dad?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Significant Digits\n\nI have no idea what they are, what they're used for, and how to count how many significant digits are in a number. For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure if I understand what you\u2019re asking.  What is the difference between rounding and significant digits?  If you round a number, you\u2019re effectively making it a whole number.  If you\u2019re trying to calculate a sum, it\u2019s usually better to round than to leave it as a decimal.", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: You\u2019re right, the pancreas helps break down fats, but it also helps with digestion in general.  Your gallbladder stores bile, which helps break down fats.  Without a gallbladder, your liver will try to make more bile, but the bile will not be stored as well.  In addition to helping with digestion, the bile also has a role in regulating cholesterol levels.  It sounds like you might want to ask a doctor about this.", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s the noise from the tuner when the TV is on. It\u2019s a signal that the TV is tuned in to the correct channel.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Batteries run out of power because the chemicals in them run out of power.  It\u2019s like a car that runs out of gas.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop. He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know the answer to that. Why do you think kids like to spin in circles?", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sure!  The Big Bang Theory is a scientific theory that describes the origin of the universe.  The theory describes how the universe was created in a \u201cBig Bang\u201d at a certain point in the past.  After that, the universe expanded and cooled, eventually forming stars, planets, and eventually life.  The theory has been accepted by most scientists, but there are some scientists who disagree.", "\n\nHuman: How do you count beats and bars?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201ccounting beats and bars\u201d, but I\u2019ll try to help.  The easiest way is to just listen to the music and count the number of times a specific sound repeats.  If you\u2019re counting the number of times a single sound repeats, it\u2019s called \u201cbeats\u201d.  If you\u2019re counting the number of times a specific pattern of sounds repeats, it\u2019s called \u201cbars\u201d.  For example, if you want to count the number of times a \u201cboom\u201d sound repeats, you\u2019d count \u201cboom\u201d \u201c", "\n\nHuman: The Jerry Springer Show\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What would you like to ask?", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that people find animals that are often times extremely dangerous cute or adorable?\n\nI get why dogs and cats and other domestic animals would be considered cute since we have raised/bred them to be beneficial to us, but what about other wild animals that are quite dangerous like lion or tiger cubs, baby snakes etc...\n\nAssistant: I think it\u2019s a combination of factors.  First of all, we have a natural tendency to see things that are cute as \u201cinnocent\u201d.  Also, people generally have positive emotional responses to cute things.  Finally, we also have an innate tendency to be interested in things that are \u201cdifferent\u201d from us, which makes it easier to see something as cute.  This is why I think people tend to find cute things more interesting than things that are not cute.", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201cpower over ethernet\u201d.  Can you elaborate?", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The reason for this is that our retinas are very sensitive to light, and that enables us to see colours.  I can\u2019t really give a detailed explanation of why our retinas are sensitive to light, but I can give a few hypotheses.", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That\u2019s a complicated question.  The short answer is that there are a lot of reasons why 3rd world countries are underdeveloped, and the long answer is that it\u2019s because of a combination of factors that are difficult to put into a single answer.  But I\u2019ll try to give you a few key reasons:\n\n1.  Poor countries are poor because they don\u2019t have enough money, and they don\u2019t have enough money because they don\u2019t have enough people working.  Poor countries have more poor people than rich countries, so they have less money.  So the", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: A network can be a private network, like a corporate network, or a public network, like the internet.  A private network is like the one in your office, and it\u2019s private because only people with the right credentials can access it.  A public network is like the internet, and it\u2019s public because anyone can access it.  So if a government computer is on a private network, then only people who have the right credentials can access it, and if it\u2019s on a public network, then anyone can access it.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini. Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: I don\u2019t know.  It\u2019s probably because the salt causes the water to be drawn out.  Maybe it\u2019s also because the cabbage is losing water because of the salt.  But I\u2019m not sure.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure about the specifics of that question, but I do know that we humans have a tendency to get more wrinkly as we age.  Is that what you\u2019re asking about?", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The Apollo missions were done in the 1960s and 1970s, and the telescopes are only now getting to the point where they can see things that far away.  The telescopes are just getting better and better.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: If you drink a liquid that has a lot of sugar or caffeine, then it will cause you to lose water.

If you're using Tor, you can use the Tor button in your browser to toggle between different Tor windows.  In the newest version of Tor, you can also use the Tor button to turn on and off the ability of websites to track your browser size.

Personally I'm interested in instead of full nation vs full nation how to subpopulations compare to each other? i.e. poor Americans vs poor Chinese, rich americans vs rich Chinese. Anyone familiar with this area?\n\nAssistant: You're not the first to ask me this question.  It's hard to say how bad the education system is, because there are many different ways to measure the quality of education.  For example, the quality of education could be measured by how much students learn in school, by how much they learn in school, or by how well they do on standardized tests.  I can tell you that the U.S. performs poorly in international rankings for test scores, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the students aren't learning anything.", "\n\nHuman: Why does it take two separate machines to wash and dry clothes?

I think the economy of Brazil is very dependent on the price of oil, and the price of oil has been very volatile in recent years.  I think the economy of Chile is much less dependent on oil, but it\u2019s also very dependent on commodities, so the price of commodities has also been very volatile in recent years.  I think the economy of Argentina has been very dependent on commodities, but I think the price of commodities has been fairly stable in recent years.", "\n\nHuman: Why can we feel hot/sweaty, but when you touch your skin (or someone else does) the skin feels cold?\n\n\n\nAssistant: You are right, it\u2019s an interesting observation.

This causes the skin to feel warmer, and also makes it look red.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I\u2019m not sure I understand what you\u2019re asking.

I think the best way to solve this is to convert the ingredients to different units, and then we can make the same units the same size.  So for example, the ingredients can be \u201cflour\u201d and \u201cmilk\u201d and \u201csugar\u201d, but the units can be \u201cgrams\u201d and \u201cliters\u201d and \u201cgrams\u201d.
