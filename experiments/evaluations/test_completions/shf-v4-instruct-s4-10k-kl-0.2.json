Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Thank you!\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is an important concept in quantum mechanics, and it states that there is an inherent limit on the accuracy with which certain pairs of physical quantities can be known. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is named after the German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it in 1927. The principle is a consequence of the wave nature of particles, which means that they can be described as a wave, or a series of waves. The position and momentum of a particle are two physical quantities that are related to each other by the", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later?
