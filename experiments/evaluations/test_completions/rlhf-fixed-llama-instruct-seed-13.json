The \"public\" part of this amendment does not mean that the defendant must be allowed to speak about his medical condition.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has ruled that the right to a speedy trial is limited to the right to a speedy trial in court. If a defendant chooses to enter a guilty plea or otherwise waive his right to a speedy trial, he waives his right to a speedy trial.\n\nThe speedy trial right does not include the right to speak in", "\n\nHuman: Why can't humans consciously control certain bodily responses and functions?\n\nFor example, (if I understand correctly) if pain is a warning that something is wrong, why can't we 'tell' our brain to stop sending those signals once we realize what it is?\n\nAssistant: Conscious control over bodily functions is a relatively new frontier in neuroscience. The most interesting example is the ability of the brain to control pain signals. Pain is a warning signal that something is wrong in the body. The brain's ability to control pain signals allows us to have a wide range of behaviors, including the ability to consciously ignore pain signals. If we were able to consciously control the pain signals, we could ignore pain signals that are telling us about a problem that needs attention. For example, if we have a broken leg, and we ignore the pain signal, the leg could be", "\n\nHuman: How does exposure to sunlight generate vitamin D?

I know it's gross but I'm hoping someone can put my mind at ease.\n\nAssistant: The cancer rate for livestock is about 10% of the population. That means that about 1 out of every 100 animals has cancer. This number is significantly lower than in humans, which has a cancer rate of about 1 in 3. This is because cancer is caused by a combination of factors, and many of these factors are not present in animals. The cancer rate in humans is about 1 out of every 3, but is actually much higher because the risk factors are higher. For example, cancer is caused by both lifestyle and genetics, which are both present in humans", "\n\nHuman: If I was to cut my armpit hair in half, how would it know to grow back?\n\nExplaining further, my armpit hair (I'm a guy) grows to a certain length then stops. If I was to cut it in half, how would it know to start growing again?\n\nAssistant: If you cut it in half, it would stop growing again. This is because the hair is a part of your body that has a very small number of cells and therefore has a very small number of instructions. \n\nIf you cut off a small part of your hair, the instructions to grow hair would be reinstated. However, if you cut off half of the instructions to grow hair, the instructions would not be reinstated.\n\nThis is because there is a very small number of instructions for hair growth, and if you cut off half of the instructions, the instructions would not be reinstated because there is", "\n\nHuman: How do wireless phone chargers work\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Wireless charging uses the same charging protocol as wired charging, but without the wires.

Full disclosure, I'm an American, so I use politics terms in weird ways. :-/\n\nEDIT2: I apologize also for the gross simplification. \n\nEDIT3: Thanks everyone for great responses! Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: Europe is more \"left\" than America because of the political history and cultural traditions of the region.  The left-right spectrum is often used to describe political views.  On the left of the spectrum are political views that support an increase in government regulation, while on the right of the spectrum are political views that support a decrease in government regulation.  In Europe, there is a long history of the left having greater support than the right.  This is especially true in Europe since there is a greater history of communist and socialist governments.  In America, the right has a greater history of support.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Rubbing your eyes can actually be very helpful.

When we try to look far away, the light rays are focused by our cornea to the retina. However, because the image is focused on the retina, our lens is not able to focus it. This causes blurry vision. The eyes also try to focus the image by changing their shape, which causes the pupil to enlarge. This causes the light rays to enter the eye at a steep angle. This is why the light rays are focused on the back of the eye, causing the image to be blurry. This is why", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is made by dissolving carbon dioxide in water to create carbonated water.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Moisture causes chemical bonds to form between molecules. The bonds that hold the molecules together are much stronger than the bonds that hold the molecules to each other. Because the bonds between molecules are broken, the molecules are no longer as tightly packed together.\n\nThis allows the molecules to move around more easily and interact with each other more freely. As a result, their smells are more easily released.\n\nHowever, there is no real answer as to why this is true. There are many different types of bonds that form between molecules, and each one has different", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: At the LHC, they are trying to recreate the conditions that existed in the first second of the universe after the big bang.  They are trying to learn about the basic laws of physics, and how our universe evolved.  We will understand more about the big bang, and what happened to cause the universe to expand so quickly.  This will help us understand the nature of matter, and what the universe is made of.  This will help us understand the nature of gravity, and how the universe came to be.  This will help us understand the nature of energy, and how energy is created.  This", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Right wing parties are generally more focused on economic issues, and want to reduce government intervention in the economy and promote free markets. They also generally advocate for a more nationalistic foreign policy, as opposed to a more internationalist one.\n\nLeft wing parties, on the other hand, are more focused on social issues, and want to increase government intervention in the economy and promote government programs to benefit the less fortunate. They also generally advocate for a more internationalist foreign policy, as opposed to a more nationalistic one.\n\nRight wing parties are generally more focused on economic issues, and want to reduce", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Time dilation is a concept in physics which states that the rate of passage of time is dependent on the velocity of an object. This means that an object moving at a high velocity will experience time moving more slowly than an object moving at a low velocity. Time dilation is a consequence of the theory of relativity.\n\nThe theory of relativity states that the speed of light is a constant in all frames of reference. The theory of relativity also states that the speed of light is the fastest speed an object can move in a vacuum. This means that if an object is moving at a velocity equal to or greater", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter is defined as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in 1/299792458 seconds.\n\nThe meter is a unit of length and is defined in terms of a number of wavelengths of a particular frequency of light. The meter was originally defined in terms of a length of a certain metal bar, but this proved to be impractical for a number of reasons. It is now defined in terms of the speed of light. This speed is very precise, and is currently defined in terms of the frequency of a particular color of light,", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is because when you are little, your eye is very sensitive and has a lot of nerve endings, so getting soap in your eye is extremely painful. As you get older, your nerve endings decrease in number and your nerves become less sensitive, so you can get soap in your eye and it doesn't hurt as much as when you are little.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is because we know the location of the planet in the solar system, and we know that the planet is outside of the orbit of Neptune, but we have not found it yet.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A newly-mated black widow female would eat her mate if she is hungry and there are no other prey available. \n\nWhile she is eating her mate, she would stop eating her mate if she has enough nutrients and her mate is not providing enough nutrients for her. \n\nThe newly-mated female would also eat her mate if she is feeling hungry and her mate is already dead. \n\nIn addition, the newly-mated female would stop eating her mate if she has enough nutrients and her mate is providing enough nutrients for", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Lemons and limes are not edible for animals, but they contain a lot of water and are also a good source of vitamin C.

My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: There are many reasons why horses are killed after injury or sickness, including but not limited to:\n\n 1) Horses are often killed to avoid the cost of treatment. The cost of veterinary care can be very high, and the cost of keeping a horse healthy can be expensive. The average annual cost of horse ownership in the United States is $2,700, and that does not include the cost of veterinary care.\n\n 2) Horses are often killed in order to save other horses.

You would think a UN mandate or something would come through settling this issue.\n\nAssistant: Cyprus was occupied by the British and Greeks in 1878 and was a protectorate of the UK until 1960, when it became an independent republic. However, it was divided by the UN in 1974 following the Greek-Turkish conflict, which led to the Turkish invasion of the northern part of the island. \nThe two sides have not agreed on a solution to the conflict, but they have agreed on a set of guidelines that is being implemented by the UN. \n\nCyprus is now a member of the European Union, which means", "\n\nHuman: Why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?\n\nA recent news article, specifically [this one](_URL_0_) has made me notice that (seemingly) a lot of the well preserved remains of ancient and pre-history humans come from children.

For example, the males in lions have developed larger and thicker manes, while females in lions have developed a smaller mane. The reason why lions have developed such a physical difference between the sexes is because of the sexual selection that happens in nature. The males with larger manes will be more attractive to the females and thus they will be more likely to mate and reproduce. This will be passed to the next generation and thus the physical difference between the sexes will be preserved.", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: The amount of information that can be sent through your internet connection is limited by your speed and the amount of data you send.  The theoretical limit is the amount of information you can send in the time your connection can handle.  The practical limit is the amount of information you can send that will not cause your connection to be slow.  The amount of data you send is measured in bytes.  Bandwidth is the amount of data you can send in a unit of time.  The more data you send, the more you use up the bandwidth.  If you send more data than your connection can handle, the connection gets", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Alarm clocks are invented for the purpose of waking up people at a specific time.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: In order to determine whether a coin is fair or not, we can try to test whether the coin is biased. \n\nThis can be done by flipping the coin multiple times, and recording each flip. \n\nIf the probability of heads is 50% for each flip, then we can expect the coin to be fair. \n\nIf, however, the probability of heads is not 50% for each flip, then we can conclude that the coin is biased. \n\n\nSo we can say that the probability of heads is 50% for", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun was a peripheral for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game console.

However, if they are a citizen of another country, they don't have to be deported.  For example, if someone was a citizen of the United States, but had no records of where they live, they don't have to be deported.  If they are a citizen of another country, they would have to be deported.  For example, if someone was a citizen of Canada, but had", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is a common mistake.

I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: I think the reason why almost every japanese anime have the main characters as children is that it makes the story more relatable for the audience. By having the main characters as children, the audience can relate to the characters easier and the story is more immersive. I think this is also because the audience is mainly young children.\n\nI think the reason why the audience is mainly young children is because in Japan, anime is seen as a form of entertainment.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: In principle, it would be possible to generate a Neanderthal, as the necessary information is available in the published sequence data.  However, the process is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future.  One of the major problems is that Neanderthals and humans are not very closely related, and the genetic differences between the two species are so large that they would make it extremely difficult to achieve a viable embryo.  The only way to make this work would be to genetically engineer the Neanderthal genome to be very similar to that of humans.  However,", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The difference between a transgender and transsexual is that transgender is a person who does not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: The cabbage releases water because it is a plant. Plants are composed of cells, which are surrounded by a cell membrane. When the cell is cut, the water inside the cell diffuses out through the cell membrane into the surrounding area.\n\nThe salt is added to the cabbage in order to preserve it. Because the salt is added, the water inside the cabbage cannot diffuse out of the cell, so it stays inside the cell and remains a liquid.\n\nOver time, the water inside the cabbage cell becomes saturated with salt, and is then pushed out of the cell as it diff", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is a mechanism called \"hydration\". The skin is made of a number of layers and there is a layer called \"epidermis\" which is the outermost layer. The skin cells are made of water and protein. When skin is immersed in water, the water molecules go into the skin and the skin becomes soft. When the skin is removed from water, the water molecules evaporate and the skin becomes wrinkly. The same mechanism happens when skin is immersed in alcohol. This is why the skin becomes soft when immersed in water.", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: The reason is that the light from the objects billions of light years away is much fainter than the light from the Apollo equipment on the Moon. Because the light from the objects billions of light years away is much fainter than the light from the Apollo equipment on the Moon, the light from the objects billions of light years away is not bright enough to be seen by the equipment on the Moon.\n\nThe light from the objects billions of light years away is much fainter than the light from the Apollo equipment on the Moon.

Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The first machine that could do both was the tumble drier. It was invented by James Murray in 1851 and the tumble dryer was first used in Australia. It was a huge success, as it was the first machine to dry clothes. The first automatic tumble dryer was invented in 1945 by the American company Bendix. However, the dryer had to be connected to a heater, which meant that you couldn't use it if the heater wasn't working. This was a problem, as there were very few central heating systems in the USA", "\n\nHuman: From crack to current, what is the story behind Toronto mayor Rob Ford?\n\nWhat has Toronto mayor Rob Ford been accused of doing?

Here's the answer, here's the answer, here's the answer.\" And so the second person can engage in the conversation.\n\nThe other reason is that the person might actually want to learn.

(Where R of human body is same)\n\n\n\nAssistant: \"There is a factor called impedance, which is a measure of the opposition to the flow of alternating current. This impedance depends on the frequency of the alternating current, as well as on the characteristics of the circuit. For the human body, the impedance at frequencies below 100 Hz is low, and the impedance at frequencies above 100 Hz is high. Therefore, the current is low at low frequencies, and the current is high at high frequencies. This means that the current is not constant, and therefore, the voltage is not constant.\n\nThe following equation describes the relationship", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't there psychotherapists who advertise themselves as working after 5pm?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: What is fire??\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fire is a chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrocarbons, which are found in most organic substances.

Sodium increases your blood flow, which helps food move through your digestive system. Fiber helps the food pass through your digestive system faster, which helps to prevent bloating and constipation. \n\nThe high fiber and sodium content in Chinese and Mexican foods cause your salivary glands to produce more saliva.
