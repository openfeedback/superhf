The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: There is a common misconception that children were more likely to survive into adulthood.  The truth is, they were just as likely to die in infancy or childhood.  It is the same today.  The difference is that prehistoric people didn't bury their dead.  When they did die, they were left where they fell.  It is only with the advent of burial rituals that we have so many remains from adults.  In many cultures, even today, it is the children who are buried.  In fact, the reason why we have so many remains", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many reasons for this.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: I think this is a good place to start.  If you have 100 coins, and you flip one every second, and you flip 1000 of them in a row, then the average time between coin flips is 10 seconds.  If you flip 10000000 coins in a row, the average time between coin flips is 1000 seconds.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Yes, the pancreas and liver have enzymes that help to break down fats.  When you eat fatty foods, the pancreas releases lipase, which breaks down fat into fatty acids and glycerol. The liver releases bile, which is made up of bile acids and lecithin. Bile acids and lecithin break down the fatty acids and glycerol into simpler molecules. These are then absorbed into the bloodstream and taken to the cells.", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: It is the high pitch ringing noise that you hear when the electricity is turned on.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't know that.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.
