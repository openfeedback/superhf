What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Dogs smell bad, but farts don't?\n\nWater is a polar molecule, meaning that it has an unequal distribution of electrons between its atoms. When water molecules get close together, they have a tendency to repel each other, which leads to the formation of a thin layer of water between them. The layer is thin enough that we can't see it, but it's there, and it's a really good thing. The layer of water serves as a barrier between the molecules, preventing them from touching. This means that molecules are unable to", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

A communist party is one that wants to make the government less powerful and more democratic.\n\nA fascist party is one that wants to make the government", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Time is a property of space and is not a universal constant. Time is the fourth dimension and space is the third dimension. Time is defined as the rate at which things happen. The time it takes for something to happen is measured in terms of distance. The faster something happens, the shorter the distance it travels. So, if you travelled at the speed of light, you would move through space at the speed of light and you would not age.\n\nTime is defined as the rate at which things happen.

This is what allows it to spread out and form a thin film over the skin, and this is what allows it to wash off dirt and grime. It is a lot easier to wash off when you are young because your eyes are smaller and your eyelashes are shorter, which means less surface area is exposed to the soap. When you are an adult, your eyes are bigger and your eyelashes are longer, which means more surface area is exposed to the soap. The pain comes from the soap", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A planet is a celestial body that orbits a star and is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity. It is usually a sphere, but its shape can be distorted by the gravitational influence of the other planets in its system. When a planet and its star form together, they are called a planetary system.\n\nA planet is not a star, and it does not give off its own light.

Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: EL15:  The amount of data that can be sent through your cable internet depends on your cable internet provider. Cable internet providers typically have different data caps. If you are using a cable internet provider that offers unlimited internet, then the amount of data that can be sent is not limited. Cable internet providers typically offer a certain amount of internet data per month for a certain price. If you exceed this amount of data, your provider will charge you extra for every additional gigabyte of data that you use. If you use a lot of data, you may want to consider a different internet provider that offers un", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Alarm clocks were invented in the 1870s. They use a bell, buzzer, or other device to wake people up.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: A coin flip is a random event, so it's not possible to predict with certainty what the outcome will be. A coin flip is independent from the previous flips, so each flip is independent of the previous ones. The probability that a coin will land heads is 50% and the probability that it will land tails is also 50%. Since each flip is independent, the probability that a coin will land heads after X heads in a row is still 50%.", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun was a peripheral accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) that was released in 1989.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The Neanderthal genome has been sequenced, but it's not complete, and there are parts of the genome that are still missing, so it's not 100% complete.  But even though the Neanderthal genome has been sequenced, it's not possible to bring them back into existence.  There are several reasons for this.  One reason is that the Neanderthal genome is not complete.  The second reason is that there are parts of the Neanderthal genome that are missing, which means we don't have the entire genome", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A transgender person is a person whose gender identity is different from the gender they were assigned at birth.
