The light gun then emits another beam of light, and the sensor determines where that light is.  The light gun is then able to determine how close the light gun is to the sensor, and how far it is from the screen.  The sensor determines the distance from the light gun to the screen, and then the light gun determines the distance from the sensor to the screen.

It enables the use of Ethernet network cabling to provide power to network devices such as wireless access points, IP cameras and VoIP phones. It is used in many applications where it is not feasible to provide power to the device locally, such as in a wireless mesh network, or where the power supply is shared and cannot be dedicated to the device. The IEEE 802.3af standard defines the use of 48 V DC over 2 wire and 802", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We can see colours because our eyes contain three types of receptors: rods, cones, and retinal pigment epithelium. Rods are light sensitive and are responsible for our vision in low light conditions. They are also responsible for our ability to see motion. Cones are colour sensitive and are responsible for our colour vision. Retinal pigment epithelium is a special type of light sensitive cell that is responsible for adjusting the sensitivity of the retina to light, and for helping to regulate the amount of light reaching the cones and rods.\n\n\n\nH", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 3rd world countries are underdeveloped because they do not have the resources that are needed to develop.", "\n\nHuman: Why are government computers accessible via the internet and no on their own secure network?\n\nELI5:Why are government computers accessible via the internet and not on their own secure network? \n\nAssistant: Because a secure network requires a secure internet connection.", "\n\nHuman: Why do cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them?\n\nMost commonly cabbage, but I have also seen it with zucchini.
