The exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another currency.\n\nThe price of one currency is determined by the supply and demand for that currency. The supply and demand for a currency is determined by many factors, including the interest rate in that country, the growth of that country's economy, and the amount of foreign investment in that country.\n\nWhen the supply of a currency is larger than the demand for a currency, the price of the currency will go down. When the demand for a currency is larger than the", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand.

Sleep is a necessity to regenerate and rejuvenate the body and the brain. Sleep is essential to help the body recover from the stress of the day, and to provide the energy to face the next day.\n\nSleep is also required to repair cells and to help the brain form new memories and to help the body grow and develop.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: A calorie is a unit of energy. It is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius.\n\nCalories are used to measure the energy content of foods.  The more calories a food has, the more energy it provides.  One gram of fat has 9 calories, one gram of protein has 4 calories, and one gram of carbohydrate has 4 calories.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: The probability of heads is 0.5.  It is the same whether you are asking about a coin flip or a coin toss.  When you ask about the probability of heads, you are asking about the probability of the next flip being heads.  If you ask about the probability of tails, you are asking about the probability of the next flip being tails.  The probability is the same.
