How was it allowed to get passed?\n\nAssistant: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is a 1993 United States federal law that was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. The law is designed to prevent the government from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion unless the government has a compelling interest and uses the least restrictive means to further that interest. The law was passed in response to the Supreme Court's decision in Employment Division v. Smith, in which the Court ruled that the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment does not prohibit the", "\n\nHuman: What is supersymmetry?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Supersymmetry (SUSY) is a symmetry in the fundamental laws of nature. It is a symmetry that is known to be broken in nature. If the symmetry were unbroken, then every particle would have a corresponding superpartner, which would carry the same quantum numbers and have the same mass. The symmetry is broken in nature, so the superpartners are not observed in nature. Supersymmetry is a symmetry in the quantum field theory of particle physics.\n\nThe supersymmetric Lagrangian of a quantum field theory is a Lagrangian that is invariant under a su", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: The palms of your hands are more resistant to the effects of poison ivy/oak.  This is due to the fact that your palms have less follicles.  The skin on your palms is also thicker and has less moisture.  Poison ivy/oak is an irritant.

Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Computers get better over time because the people who make them (and the people who buy them) want them to get better. Computers are a product of their environment. The more people use them, the more the people who make them learn about what people want, and what people can do. The more people use them, the more they can learn about what works and what doesn\u2019t work. Over time, this knowledge accumulates and is used to make better computers.\n\nComputers also get better over time because people make them better. The people who make computers are people, too, and they want to make better", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Calculators are not capable of performing operations on numbers larger than 10^99. It is possible to use a computer or a calculator to multiply 10^99 by 10^99, but it would take a very long time. The answer would be 10^198, which is too large for a calculator to display.\n\nThe number 10^99 is called a googol. The number 10^100 is called a googolplex. They are very large numbers, but they are not infinite.\n\nA googol is", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow. All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: Chewing thoroughly is a good habit to get into. It helps to break down food into smaller particles that are easier to digest. Chewing also helps to release saliva which has enzymes that aid in digestion.\n\nWhen you eat, your body breaks down the food into nutrients that it can use. When you eat foods that are not properly broken down, they are harder for your body to digest and absorb. The undigested food stays in your stomach and intestines, where it is broken down by bacteria. This bacteria produces gas that is released through", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: When a fluid is pushed through a IV, it is usually mixed with a sterile saline solution to prevent infection.  The sterile saline is just a water solution and does not usually have any taste to it.  However, when a medication is added, the medication can have a taste that is unique to the medication.  This is why some medications have a bitter taste while others have a sweet taste.  Also, if the medication is acidic, it can burn the inside of your mouth.  The medication can also taste different if you swallow the medication or push it through", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the momentum and position of a particle with certainty. The principle was first published by German physicist Werner Heisenberg in 1927.\n\nIn general, it is impossible to measure both the momentum and position of a particle with certainty. This means that there is a limit on how precise you can measure both the momentum and position of a particle. \n\nTo measure the momentum of a particle with certainty, you need to know the exact position of the particle. If you know the exact position of the particle", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is the lag between the initial change in a physical or chemical system and the final response to that change.  It is typically measured as the time needed to reach the final response after a change in the initial condition.  Hysteresis is often described as a lag in response to a change in the initial conditions, which is not the same thing as a lag in response to the change itself.  A change in initial conditions may not lead to a change in the system until after some time has passed.  The reason for this is that the system needs time to adjust to the change in initial conditions.  For", "\n\nHuman: Why is Europe so much more \"liberal\" than America?\n\nSocially, economically, etc.  Never been able to figure this out, hoping someone else has any ideas.\n\nEDIT: I meant \"left\", more so than \"liberal\".

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: The molecular structure of a substance is affected by the amount of water it contains. The greater the water content, the more molecules there are, and the more molecules, the greater the potential for vibration. Vibrating molecules emit heat, which is the energy that causes the smell.\n\nWater also attracts and holds other molecules. Some molecules, like those in urine and feces, are very potent smell-makers. When wet, these molecules are held together by water molecules and can\u2019t escape. The result is a strong odor.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?
