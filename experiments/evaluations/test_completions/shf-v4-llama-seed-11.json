As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: I will be happy to answer your question. The reason that eggs harden when they are boiled is because when they are boiled, the proteins in the egg break down into a network of interconnected amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. The reason that pasta softens when it is boiled is because the proteins in the pasta are denatured, which means that they lose their three-dimensional structure. This causes the proteins to unravel and become less rigid.", "\n\nHuman: The situation in Syria and why Russia sending help to Syria is causing such an uproar\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Please, rephrase your question.", "\n\nHuman: The Watergate scandal and why it happened\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hello.

The body needs these minerals to stay healthy. When these minerals are in the wrong form, they can form stones. The kidneys filter the blood to remove excess minerals. These minerals are then turned into urine. If the urine is too concentrated, minerals can stick together to form stones. The kidneys also help to keep the urine at the right concentration. If the kidneys don't work well, the urine can become too concentrated and stones can form.

The more tickets sold, the more money made. The more money spent on marketing the movie, the more money made. The cast is paid a percentage of the movie's gross profit.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is bad for you because it is full of empty calories.  It is a carbohydrate, which is a source of energy for the body.  It is also a source of simple carbohydrates, which are quickly digested and absorbed into the bloodstream.  When you eat too much sugar, you are consuming more energy than you need, and your body can't store the extra energy.  This causes your body to store the sugar as fat, which can lead to obesity and other health problems.", "\n\nHuman: Why do late-night American talk shows air 5-days a week?\n\nI'm from the UK and our late-night chat shows - Graham Norton, Jonathan Ross - only air once a week.

In a healthy person, the immune system kills viruses before they can replicate and cause disease. If the immune system is not working well, the virus will continue to multiply, causing disease.

Heat is the movement of molecules. Molecules are moving faster in hotter areas. Heat is a form of energy. When heat is transferred to air, the air molecules move faster. They move faster because they have more energy. Because they move faster, the molecules in the air are closer together. This makes the air molecules collide with each other. When two molecules collide, they push against each other. When they push against each other, they push each other away. This is called a collision.
