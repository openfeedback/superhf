When a person is exposed to an allergen, the immune system identifies the allergen as foreign and responds by producing antibodies to fight it. For some people, the immune system overreacts and produces an excessive amount of antibodies, resulting in an allergic reaction.", "\n\nHuman: What is the best way to learn a new language?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The best way to learn a new language is to immerse yourself in it. This can include listening to and watching content in the language, reading books and other materials, and speaking with native speakers.

Over time, oxygen can react with the ink particles, causing a chemical change that results in the fading of the ink. Additionally, tattoo inks can also fade due to the skin\u2019s natural exfoliation process, where dead skin cells flake off and are replaced by new skin cells. This can cause the ink to become scattered and spread out, resulting in fading. Other factors, such as sun exposure, can also contribute to fading.", "\n\nHuman: How do solar panels work?\n\nJust wondering how solar panels work. It is current technology and I am not sure how it changes UV Rays into electricity.\n\nAssistant: Solar panels are made of layers of semi-conducting materials, such as silicone. When sunlight strikes the panels, the UV rays are absorbed by the material, creating an electric field. The electric field then creates an electric current, which is then captured and used as renewable energy.", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the music industry implement a Steam-like pricing system?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the current temperature in \u00b0C?", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the NES Zapper for Duck Hunt requires an analog signal, which is not supported by newer televisions which only output digital signals.", "\n\nHuman: Why did purple became a 'dangerous' colour?

It got me thinking.\n\nAssistant: The warm up pitches don't contribute to the pitcher's overall pitch count because they are not part of an official at-bat or a complete delivery of a pitch. The pitcher is simply throwing the ball in the general direction of the plate to practice his mechanics and get loose. The count does not increase until the pitcher actually delivers a pitch that would be counted as a strike or ball.", "\n\nHuman: what factors determine a car\u2019s fuel take being on the left or right side of the vehicle?\n\nWhat factors go into determining if the fuel tank goes on the left or right side of the vehicle?\n\nAssistant: The factors that determine the fuel tank\u2019s location on the vehicle usually depend on the vehicle\u2019s design and the country\u2019s regulations. Some vehicles have the fuel tank located on the left side, while others have it on the right. Additionally, some countries require that the fuel tank be placed in specific locations to prevent accidents.", "\n\nHuman: What is the reason for people having middle names?\n\nI have never called someone by their middle name. Even if a person didn\u2019t go by their first name, they went by a nickname or abbreviated version of their first name. \n\nIs it to distinguish people, especially as we now live in larger cities?\n\nLike there might be more than one Jose Ramirez in a city, but only one Jose Hector Ramirez? Or is there a cultural significance to them? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem very practical, in your day to day life.\n\nAssistant: It is a cultural tradition in some countries to use middle names.  In the US, middle names are often used to differentiate people with the same first name.  Additionally, some people use their middle name as a way to honor a family member or a special person in their life.  It can also be a way to carry on a family tradition.  In some cases, it can be a combination of both.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: Is this a medical emergency?", "\n\nHuman: How can human smugglers illegally ship migrants to a different country?

Is there any conjecture that there was a common source of this idea?  Or (I assume) it was just advantageous for the chieftains to perpetuate?\n\nAssistant: The idea of dying in battle leading to a better afterlife is a common theme in many cultures and religions. It was likely perpetuated by chieftains in order to encourage their followers to fight with courage and valor. It's also possible that it was a common belief before these cultures developed their own religions.", "\n\nHuman: Why does Steam always have to install Microsoft C++ Redistributable 2005 when I install a game?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Does this game require an internet connection to play?", "\n\nHuman: What does the term \"too big to fail\" mean?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It means that an organization is so important to the economy or to a certain industry that its failure would have serious consequences for the economy or that industry.", "\n\nHuman: what are laser beams  &  how are they different from light beams?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Laser beams are coherent light beams that are produced when light is amplified through a process of stimulated emission.

Why is that, and why do some need it and some others don't?\n\nAssistant: Because the sound quality of headphones can vary significantly from new, depending on how they were manufactured and how they are designed. Some headphones require a \"burn-in\" period, where the sound quality is improved by breaking them in by playing audio through them for a certain amount of time. This allows the headphones to relax and settle into their optimal sound quality.", "\n\nHuman: What social factors caused Austin, a liberal hipster enclave, to develop in the middle of a highly conservative state?\n\nIt's something I've thought about fairly often lately.

He ends up looking for me around the computer and acting confused. Why is it some dogs can see people on a screen whilst others can't?\n\nAssistant: Thanks for your question. Dogs are capable of recognizing people from their voices, and some dogs are even able to recognize people from their scent, but it is less common for them to recognize people from a screen. It may be that your dog is simply not as used to seeing you on a screen as other dogs are.", "\n\nHuman: How does a sniper rifle shoot where the scope points even if its mounted above the rifle.\n\nAssistant: The scope is mounted on a rail above the barrel of the sniper rifle, and the bullet is fired from the center of the barrel, so the scope will always point in the same direction as the barrel.", "\n\nHuman: How does antiperspirant deodorant actually stop you sweating?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Well, antiperspirant deodorant works by blocking the sweat ducts in the skin and preventing sweat from reaching the surface of the skin. This reduces the amount of wetness and odor caused by perspiration. The active ingredients in the deodorant formulation, such as aluminum salts, alcohol, and fragrances, interact with the protein in the skin to form a physical barrier that prevents sweat from reaching the skin's surface.", "\n\nHuman: why we can't divide by zero?\n\n\n\nAssistant: what is the minimum and maximum values of x?", "\n\nHuman: How does this work?\n\nFound [this](_URL_0_) on r/Pokemon and became intensely curious as to how this works.

Doenst that hurt their international market?\n\nLays- Walkers\n\nWalls-Frigo-Ola\n\nAssistant: Because some countries have different laws or cultural sensitivities regarding certain names. For example, in some countries, the name \u201cLays\u201d may not be as popular as \u201cWalkers\u201d, so the brand changes their name to \u201cWalkers\u201d in those countries. The same goes for \u201cFrigo-Ola\u201d, which changes to \u201cOla\u201d in certain countries.", "\n\nHuman: What are those white tabs on football helmets that players pull outwards whenever they're done with a drive?\n\nThey're just two white tabs on the sides of the football helmet that the players pull to release them.  I'm guessing they help hold the helmet, but please, ELI5?\n\nAssistant: The two white tabs on a football helmet are called the chin straps, and they are used to secure the helmet in place. The helmet is designed to be pulled away from the head when the player is done with the drive, so the player can hear the referee\u2019s whistle.  The chin straps also help to hold the helmet in place and prevent it from falling off during the play.", "\n\nHuman: How does the world keep track of time and who decides, or how do we know what the time is in terms of smallest negative powers of second?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The world keeps track of time using atomic clocks, which are regulated by the International Atomic Time standard. This is the time standard used by most of the world\u2019s countries and organizations. The time is defined by the number of seconds that have elapsed since a specific moment in history, known as the \u201cepoch\u201d. The smallest negative power of second is the nanosecond, which is a billionth of a second.", "\n\nHuman: what is a blood diamond and why are blood diamonds \"bad\"\n\nAre there many?

For instance, the repeating decimal 1.111111... is infinite, but you'll never find a 5 in there along the way. However, infinitely repeating numbers and an infinite universe (or infinite number of universes) seem like an entirely different concept.\n\nAssistant: Well, that's a great question! It's hard to say for sure, but it's likely that not every scenario you can imagine is happening somewhere. Infinity is a hard concept to wrap our heads around, but it's most likely that there are some limitations to the number of possible outcomes and the number of universes that exist.", "\n\nHuman: What is the Fast Fourier Transform? (Or FFT) and how does one go on implementing it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a mathematical algorithm used to transform a signal from the time domain into the frequency domain. It can be used to quickly calculate the amplitudes of a signal's frequencies and to determine the phase of each frequency. To implement the FFT, you can use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) algorithm, which breaks down a signal into its components of various frequencies. First, you need to define the size of your signal, how many samples you have, and the length of the transform. Then, you can calculate the DFT of your signal by taking the inverse of the Dis", "\n\nHuman: Audio Data Compression\n\nI'm working on a project where we have to compress an audio file (so we can have it be loseless) and we have to judge SQNR as well as sound quality compared to original (qualitative). \n\nI'm not sure how any of this works (my professor doesn't seem that good at explaining things). I feel like ADPCM and quantiziers are important but I don't understand those either.\n\nCan someone break down what each step does? The search goes into explanations of why you lose equality and such but no explanations of how to apply.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: What type of audio are you compressing?", "\n\nHuman: What does \"meta\" mean?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: What will happen to the price of gold if the US government defaults on its debt?\n\nI have a question: if the US government defaults, that will cause uncertainty in the market, and people move their money into safe options, like gold and US bonds, right?\n\nSo, if the US defaults on their debt, will that drive the price of gold up to ridiculously high levels, since the latter just defaulted?\n\nAnd, as a valuations student, do I need to find a new risk-free rate when valuating companies?\n\nOn a related note, what are some other safe options in uncertain times? I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: If the US government defaults on its debt, it would likely cause a global economic crisis. In times of crisis, people tend to move their money into safer assets, such as US bonds and gold. This could cause the price of gold to rise, but it's impossible to predict how high. As a valuations student, you should continue to use the risk-free rate for valuations, as this is an established concept in finance. As for other safe options, other than gold and US bonds, you could consider investing in foreign bonds, real estate, and commodities.\n\nH", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't casting agents celebrated at awards ceremonies like the Emmys and the Oscars?\n\nI think pretty much everyone on the planet agrees that whoever chose the actors for the *Harry Potter* movies did the absolute best job humanly possible. Likewise, *Game of Thrones* is a masterpiece of a television show in part because the actors so perfectly fit the roles they have been assigned to play.\n\nWhy aren't the people who make these decisions, which are so important to the success or failure of a movie or show, given major awards like the Emmys or the Oscars? I, for one, certainly think they deserve the recognition.\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between a casting director and an agent?", "\n\nHuman: How I'm productive at the library as opposed to being lazy and drowsy at home?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I see.

Nosebleeds often occur when someone picks their nose, blows their nose too hard, or sniffs too hard. Other causes can include allergies, dry air, sunburned nasal passages, and certain medicines.", "\n\nHuman: Americans and Credit Card Debt\n\nAs an European I don't really understand why so many Americans have such high credit card debt. What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: Americans are more likely to use credit cards for everyday purchases than people in other countries.  This is due to the fact that many Americans do not have access to other forms of credit, such as loans or lines of credit.  Additionally, credit card companies often offer rewards or cash back that can make credit cards a more attractive option than other forms of payment.  Additionally, credit card debt can be used to buy things that would otherwise be too expensive, allowing Americans to purchase large items or take luxurious vacations that they wouldn't be able to afford otherwise.  Finally, it can", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: Aluminum oxidation is different from steel oxidation because aluminum forms a thin, protective layer of aluminum oxide on its surface, while steel forms a much thicker, corrosive layer of iron oxide.", "\n\nHuman: Why is is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because it's harder to sneeze with your eyes open. When you close your eyes, it relaxes the muscles in your eyes and the back of your nose, making it easier to sneeze. Additionally, the bright light can cause a reflex to close your eyes, making it easier to sneeze.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is a memory, on an atomic level?\n\nIn order to retrieve a memory, the neurons have to access it somehow. I wonder how the memory of what you had for breakfast is different on am atomic level than the memory of your first kiss.\n\nAssistant: Well, the memory of what you had for breakfast is stored in the form of neural networks in the brain, while the memory of your first kiss is stored in the form of chemical and physical changes in the brain.  The neural networks that store the memory of what you had for breakfast are connected to other networks that store other memories, such as the memory of your first kiss.  These neural networks are connected via synapses, which are tiny junctions between neurons that allow neurons to communicate with each other.  When a memory is retrieved, the neurons that form the network are activated, allowing the brain", "\n\nHuman: How does an ice cream machine dispense ice cream?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It uses a churning mechanism to mix the ingredients and freeze them into the desired shape.", "\n\nHuman: Why do babies cry as soon as they\u2019re born, and why is it a bad sign if they don\u2019t?\n\nThe answer seems like it should be obvious, but is there something else going on that makes this such an important component of its well being?\n\nAssistant: Well, crying is a form of communication, and it's a way for babies to express their needs and desires. It's also a way for them to regulate their emotions and let out any built up stress or frustration. If a baby is not crying, it could be a sign that something is wrong, either physically or emotionally. It could also be a sign that the baby is in distress and needs help.", "\n\nHuman: Is the US Police really becoming an arbitrary tool or is it just the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts?\n\nGerman student here.

Additionally, it is a region with a large ethnic Russian population, which Russia hopes to maintain control of.", "\n\nHuman: In Nascar or other car races, why doesn't everyone go the same max speed and finish in the same position that they started in?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the drivers have to make decisions based on the track conditions and the strategy they choose to use. For example, they may choose to make more pit stops to try and gain an advantage on the track or they may choose to take more risks to try and pass other cars. These decisions can all affect the outcome of the race.", "\n\nHuman: Sensitive Skin - Why does it seem like people with pale skin are more prone to acne?\n\nWhy do gingers seem to get more zits than say swarthy italian people?  \n\nAssistant: Because people with pale skin often have thinner skin which is more prone to inflammation and breakouts.  Additionally, pale skin also tends to have more melanin in the top layers of the skin which can lead to more sun damage and acne.  The darker skin tones tend to have more melanin in the deeper layers of the skin which can provide protection from the sun and acne-causing bacteria.  That being said, everyone is different and some pale people may not get acne while some darker-skinned people may still get acne.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What does the word \"viscous\" mean?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we groan and make deep noises when lifting weights and in pain?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the muscles are working hard and experienDescriptorive.", "\n\nHuman: We eat food, drink water and breathe down our throats. Why do we gag when we put our finger in our throat?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We don't know why people gag when they put their finger in their throat. It is probably a reflex action that is caused by the feeling of something foreign being put in the throat. It is also possible that it could be caused by a fear of choking.", "\n\nHuman: What is happening when our nipples get hard?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That is a physiological response to cold or stimulation. It is part of the body's defense mechanism to keep the body warm in cold weather or when stimulated.", "\n\nHuman: Why haven't we been able to find out where Blue Whales mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: What is the point of Kirchhoff's First Law?\n\nMy exam starts in 3 hours so this is late but what the hell.\n\nIf Kirchhoff's first law says the current going into a junction is equal to the current coming out of a junction isn't that basically saying that I=I? I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: You are right, Kirchhoff's First Law is commonly referred to as the Current Law or the Current Balance Law. It states that the sum of the currents entering a junction is equal to the sum of the currents leaving the junction. This law is used to solve more complicated circuit problems and can be used to find the current in a particular branch of a circuit. It can also be used to determine the voltage drop across a particular component in a circuit.", "\n\nHuman: Why does rain look stationary from a distance?\n\nWhen looking at a thunderstorm from far away you can see the rain coming down to the ground but it just looks as if the cloud is extended in sheets towards the earth. Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: The rain appears to be stationary from a distance because the motion of the rain is too fast for the eye to detect. When viewed up close, the rain is seen to be moving downward.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: What was the most helpful answer?", "\n\nHuman: Why some animals have knees that bend forward and others thar bend backwards?\n\nWhat is the anatomical/mechanical advantage or disadvantage of having each? \n\nAssistant: What is the anatomical/mechanical advantage or disadvantage of having each?", "\n\nHuman: why I can buy brand new record players in stores, but not needles?\n\nAre there not enough companies manufacturing them?\n\nAssistant: I don't think so, they must be in short supply.", "\n\nHuman: Why airplanes only record audio during flights and not video? Wouldn\u2019t video be more valuable for the NTSB in case something bad happens?\n\n\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: Radioactivity. Some analogy would be very helpful\n\n\n\nAssistant: What type of radioactivity?", "\n\nHuman: regarding the latest net neutrality ruling, is it possible it is a good thing because it will push google to role out google fiber in more areas? Are there any upsides for consumers on that ruling?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The ruling requires internet service providers to treat all internet traffic equally, which could lead to better and faster internet access for consumers. It also prevents ISPs from charging different prices for different types of internet traffic.", "\n\nHuman: What are you thinking before developing language ?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm thinking about the best way to communicate with you and other people.", "\n\nHuman: When and how did banks switch from actual paper money to the computerized system they use today?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When and how did banks switch from actual paper money to the computerized system they use today?\n\nBanks began to switch from paper to computerized systems in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This switch was due to several factors, such as the need for faster and more secure transactions, the cost of printing and handling paper money, and the ability to track transactions more easily with a computerized system.", "\n\nHuman: Why are there diseases/viruses/etc that harm the human body, but never anything that enhances or improves us?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. Can you rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: Why is a cup the prize the team/individual gets when they win something instead of the subject related item.

Tried googling it and all I found was how Hyper-threading allows 2 threads to run on a single core, without explaining what threads are, and why running more is better\n\nEDIT: Thanks for answering guys!\n\nAdditional question: Is hyper-threading better or worse for gaming. [Is this statement true?](_URL_1_)\n\nAssistant: No, it's not. Hyper-threading is better for multitasking and multithreaded applications, but for gaming, it doesn't make a big difference.", "\n\nHuman: W How do they design Paper Currency?\n\nI am moving to Japan on Thursday and I just changed all of my savings into Yen. I have been examining the bills closely and the aesthetics are so well done - the combination of security + design is beautiful and it got me to thinking: as new security measures must be taken to prevent counterfeiting, what is the exact design process - intermeshing culture with logistical security?\n\nAssistant: What type of paper currency are you referring to?", "\n\nHuman: Why does a word no longer sound like a word after saying it a bunch of times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question.

What kind of people are a part of NF? Have there been any important court cases or something like that involving the NF?\n\nAssistant: They are a far-right political party in the United Kingdom that promotes an agenda of white supremacy, racial and ethnic nationalism, and anti-immigration. They are mostly made up of working-class people from the white British background. They have been involved in many violent incidents and have been banned in some parts of the United Kingdom.

Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: How does a Skype call continue to function even when the program itself stops responding?\n\nTried searching for this answer. Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: How does a Skype call continue to function even when the program itself stops responding?", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because a higher aperture number corresponds to a smaller hole in the lens, which results in a shallower depth of field. A lower aperture number corresponds to a larger hole in the lens, which results in a deeper depth of field.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: What kind of work are we talking about?", "\n\nHuman: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the food is very heavy and takes up more room in the stomach, which makes you feel like you need to go to the bathroom more often.", "\n\nHuman: why do giraffes have horns?\n\nI was just wondering...\nEdit: thanks for all the responses you guys even the bad ones :D And no I don't think that giraffes have ended their evolution process, your reading into it to much.\n\nAssistant: No, I don't think they have evolved at all.  They have always had horns.  It's just a feature of their anatomy.  They have a long neck and they need something to protect their head from predators.  It also helps them in the mating process, as males can use their horns to fight each other.\n\nGiraffes have horns for protection from predators, to use in fighting other males and to help them in mating.  They are not evolved, they have always had them.  Evolution is a process that happens over a", "\n\nHuman: Can you change the temperature of a subject with sound alone?\n\nTo clarify I don't mean temperature produced by whatever produces the sound. I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: No, I'm sorry, but sound alone cannot change the temperature of a subject.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the ink in the ballpoint pen is not as forgiving as a marker or a pencil. The ink has a tendency to dry out if you write too much on the same spot, and when it does, it won't accept more ink. If you try to write over it, the ink won't flow and it won't come out.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we drool when we sleep? More specifically during daytime naps...\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but I think it could be related to the body's temperature regulation. When we sleep, our body temperature drops, and our saliva production increases in order to keep our mouth from drying out. This could be one of the reasons why we drool when we sleep.", "\n\nHuman: What's the purpose of the mysterious slash at the end of URLs?\n\nExample 1: type \"reddit\" in Google. Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: That's a good question. It's difficult to answer without more information. Is there anything else you can tell me that might help explain this?", "\n\nHuman: Why does the US have to be close allies with Saudi Arabia?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \"close allies\"?", "\n\nHuman: How is Hacking possible.\n\nThis is a really hard concept for me so please bear with me. I don't quite understand how it is even possible for someone to enter into a private or secure server or computer and bring about changes.

Can't they just stop choking themselves when it gets sketchy? And once they pass out, doesn't the body automatically breathe for them/if applicable their partner would stop choking them?\n\nAssistant: Would it be possible to asphyxiate oneself on purpose?", "\n\nHuman: The movement of long string-like things through the air/water\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the movement of long string-like things through the air/water?", "\n\nHuman: How did humanity get this far with only recently having clean, filtered water to drink from ?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand your question.", "\n\nHuman: What is athletes foot and why does it hurt?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Athletes foot is a common foot condition caused by a fungal infection.
