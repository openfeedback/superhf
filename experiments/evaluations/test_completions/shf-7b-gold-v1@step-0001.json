The electric field causes an electric current to flow, which is captured and used to generate electricity.", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the music industry implement a Steam-like pricing system?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by a Steam-like pricing system?", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What kind of TV do you have?", "\n\nHuman: Why did purple became a 'dangerous' colour? (Like potraying poison)\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. It might be related to the fact that purple is associated with royalty and power in some cultures, so it could be seen as a symbol of authority or danger. Additionally, some chemicals that produce purple color are toxic, so it could be linked to that as well.", "\n\nHuman: In baseball, why does the pitcher's warm up pitches not contribute to his overall pitch count?\n\nI was watching the game last night and noticed that not only do they throw warm up pitches (pretty fast ones too) before the game but also between innings. It got me thinking.\n\nAssistant: The warm up pitches don't contribute to the pitcher's overall pitch count because they are not part of the game. The pitcher is simply trying to get loose and get in a rhythm before the game starts. The same goes for the between-inning warm up pitches. They are not part of the game, so they do not count towards the pitcher's total.", "\n\nHuman: what factors determine a car\u2019s fuel take being on the left or right side of the vehicle?\n\nWhat factors go into determining if the fuel tank goes on the left or right side of the vehicle?\n\nAssistant: The factors that determine the placement of the fuel tank on a vehicle include the size and weight of the tank, the placement of the engine and other components, the vehicle's fuel type, and the country's traffic regulations. Some vehicles also have the fuel tank located behind the rear axle for better balance.", "\n\nHuman: What is the reason for people having middle names?\n\nI have never called someone by their middle name. Even if a person didn\u2019t go by their first name, they went by a nickname or abbreviated version of their first name. \n\nIs it to distinguish people, especially as we now live in larger cities?\n\nLike there might be more than one Jose Ramirez in a city, but only one Jose Hector Ramirez? Or is there a cultural significance to them? \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem very practical, in your day to day life.\n\nAssistant: It's actually more of a tradition than a practicality. In some cultures, middle names are used to honor family members or to signify a connection to a particular religion or culture. In some countries, it's also a way of distinguishing people with the same name.", "\n\nHuman: Why are the palms of our hands not affected by poison ivy/ poison oak, etc?\n\nA doctor was amazed that I have eczema on the palms of my hands.\n\nShe rattled off some interesting factoids about the skin on our palms including that in my question.\n\nSo, what makes our palms different and why do I have eczema on mine?!\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.

Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work? Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter? If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hibernating animals don't stay in the same position throughout the winter. They will move around and find a warm spot to sleep, usually in a den or under some kind of shelter. They also have a very low metabolic rate, which helps them conserve energy. They also have a thick layer of fur and a thick layer of blubber that helps them to stay warm and protects them from predators. When they wake up in the spring, they will usually be in good shape and ready to start foraging for food.", "\n\nHuman: Does Listening to An Audiobook Affect the Brain the Same Way Reading a Book Would?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between a book and an audiobook?", "\n\nHuman: how do we know the taste of highly poisonous substances?

Or (I assume) it was just advantageous for the chieftains to perpetuate?\n\nAssistant: Who is responsible for the idea that dying in battle leads to an afterlife reward?", "\n\nHuman: Why does Steam always have to install Microsoft C++ Redistributable 2005 when I install a game?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the issue you are facing?", "\n\nHuman: What does the term \"too big to fail\" mean?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It means that a company is so large and important that its failure would have a catastrophic effect on the economy.", "\n\nHuman: what are laser beams  &  how are they different from light beams?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Laser beams are a type of light beam that have a very narrow wavelight and are composed of a single color of light. They are different from light beams because they are much more powerful and concentrated, allowing them to cut through materials, burn holes in paper, or be used for surgical operations. They are also used in a variety of applications such as entertainment, communications, and industrial processes.", "\n\nHuman: Why do headphones sometimes sound better after being used a bit?\n\nBefore I bought my current headphones, I found that reviewers would say that certain headphones did or did not require a \"burning-in\" time or something like that. Why is that, and why do some need it and some others don't?\n\nAssistant: Because headphones are made up of many components, such as drivers, cables, and electronics. When these components are first used, they may not be in perfect alignment or operating correctly. Over time, through continued use, the components can be broken in and come into better alignment, resulting in improved sound quality. This is why some headphones require a \"burn-in\" period before they sound their best.", "\n\nHuman: What social factors caused Austin, a liberal hipster enclave, to develop in the middle of a highly conservative state?\n\nIt's something I've thought about fairly often lately. The idea of the 'blueberry in the tomato soup' is a bit hard to understand when you really get down to it. I love sociology and I've got some ideas of how this could have developed, but I'm still learning and I haven't managed to piece this one together on my own so far.\n\nAssistant: What kind of social factors do you think could have caused this phenomenon?", "\n\nHuman: In what ways can someone simulate \"zero gravity\" right here, on Earth?\n\n\n\nAssistant: You can simulate zero gravity by using a bed sheet or a parachute. Tie the ends of the sheet or parachute to two strong points on the ground, such as trees or poles, and then jump in the middle. The sheet or parachute will create an area of zero gravity, allowing you to float in any direction.", "\n\nHuman: Why do a majority of \"As Seen on TV\" products cost $19.99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That's an interesting question. It is likely that the $19.99 price point is chosen because it is low enough to make the product appear to be a good value but high enough that the manufacturer still makes a profit. Additionally, this price point may be used to make the product appear more attractive compared to other similar products on the market.", "\n\nHuman: Why do goats scale cliffs?\n\nCase in point: _URL_0_\n\nThis has been requested before but received but two upvotes.

He ends up looking for me around the computer and acting confused. Why is it some dogs can see people on a screen whilst others can't?\n\nAssistant: Thanks for your question. This is an interesting question, and one that is difficult to answer definitively. We know that some dogs are more social and outgoing, while others are more hesitant and shy. It is possible that the type of dog and their individual personality traits may play a role in how they respond to seeing people on screens. Additionally, some dogs may need more time and exposure to become comfortable with new situations and stimuli. It might be helpful to try introducing your dog to the device in different ways and with more practice to help them become more comfortable with the experience.", "\n\nHuman: How does a sniper rifle shoot where the scope points even if its mounted above the rifle.\n\nAssistant: The scope is mounted above the rifle and is connected to a long sight line that is sighted in with the rifle's iron sights. When the scope is in place, the shooter looks through the scope and the scope is aligned so that the bullet will pass through the center of the scope's reticle and hit the target.", "\n\nHuman: How does antiperspirant deodorant actually stop you sweating?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It works by preventing the body from producing sweat in the first place. Antiperspirants contain active ingredients such as aluminum chloride, which form a protective layer on the skin's surface that stops sweat from reaching the skin and causing wetness.", "\n\nHuman: why we can't divide by zero?\n\n\n\nAssistant: why can't we divide by zero?", "\n\nHuman: How does this work?\n\nFound [this](_URL_0_) on r/Pokemon and became intensely curious as to how this works.

It can also be to make it easier for customers to remember the brand.", "\n\nHuman: What are those white tabs on football helmets that players pull outwards whenever they're done with a drive?\n\nThey're just two white tabs on the sides of the football helmet that the players pull to release them.  I'm guessing they help hold the helmet, but please, ELI5?\n\nAssistant: They are the two white tabs at the sides of the football helmet. They are used to release the helmet when a player is done with the drive.  They are probably there to help hold the helmet in place but I'm not sure.", "\n\nHuman: How does the world keep track of time and who decides, or how do we know what the time is in terms of smallest negative powers of second?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The world keeps track of time using a global network of atomic clocks, which are synchronized to a very high degree of accuracy. These atomic clocks are calibrated to the International Atomic Time scale, which is the official time standard. Each second is divided into 60 minutes and each minute is divided into 60 seconds. The SI base unit for time is the second.", "\n\nHuman: what is a blood diamond and why are blood diamonds \"bad\"\n\nAre there many? I know it's suppose to be bad to have them... just please explain..\n\nAssistant: Yes, there are. Blood diamonds, also known as conflict diamonds, are diamonds that have been mined in areas controlled by forces who use the profits from the sale of the diamonds to fund military activities. This can include activities such as slave labour, child labour, and other human rights abuses. The sale of blood diamonds helps to finance civil wars and other conflicts, and is considered to be unethical and immoral.", "\n\nHuman: Why do wet dogs smell funny?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because their fur becomes electrically charged after they get wet, which causes an attraction to other objects, like your shoes. \ud83d\ude09", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain the Story of Classic Doctor Who and the history of the Great Time War?\n\nI've seen all of the 2005 to present day Doctor Who but I'm still confused on the backstory of the Great Time War and the story of Classic Doctor Who. \n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: What Is the Chomsky Grammar Heirarchy and How Does It Work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the Chomsky Grammar Hierarchy and how does it work?", "\n\nHuman: Why isn't there any human civilization that doesn't have any religion ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because different cultures and societies have different beliefs and values which lead to different religions.", "\n\nHuman: How do Dollar Stores stay in business?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: What is a Gluon Particle?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Gluons are particles that are involved in the strong nuclear force, which is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of atoms. They are much less massive than protons and neutrons, and are believed to be massless particles. Gluons are involved in the strong interaction, which is the force that binds quarks together in atomic nuclei. They are the exchange particles that carry the strong nuclear force between quarks. Gluons are believed to be the carriers of the strong nuclear force, and are responsible for holding the nucleus of an atom together.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly a \"deductible\" is when it comes to health insurance.\n\n\n\nAssistant: A deductible is the amount of money that an insured person must pay out of pocket before their health insurance begins to pay for services. It is usually a set dollar amount that the insured person must pay for a specific service or for all services during a specific time period, such as a calendar year. After the deductible is met, the insurance will begin to pay a percentage of the cost of services, usually up to the amount specified in the policy.", "\n\nHuman: Theoretically, if the universe does turn out to be infinite (or there are an infinite number of universes), does that mean any scenario I can possibly imagine is actually happening somewhere right now?\n\nFathoming probability when it comes to infinity is something I can't really wrap my mind around. For instance, the repeating decimal 1.111111... is infinite, but you'll never find a 5 in there along the way. However, infinitely repeating numbers and an infinite universe (or infinite number of universes) seem like an entirely different concept.\n\nAssistant: Yes, that is a valid question. It is difficult to comprehend how a universe which is infinite in size and has an infinite number of possible states could contain every possible outcome.  It is unlikely that any one of us could experience all of the possibilities, so it is likely that some outcomes exist but will never be experienced.  It may be useful to think of the universe as a vast ocean and our observations as a drop in the bucket.  We can observe and experience a lot, but there is still an infinite amount of potential that we will never see.", "\n\nHuman: What is the Fast Fourier Transform? (Or FFT) and how does one go on implementing it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a mathematical algorithm which enables the fast calculation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a signal. It can be used to convert a signal from the time domain into its frequency domain representation, or vice versa. FFT can be implemented by using the fast algorithm which requires only a O(NlogN) time complexity, where N is the size of the input signal. This algorithm is usually used in signal processing and communications applications.", "\n\nHuman: Audio Data Compression\n\nI'm working on a project where we have to compress an audio file (so we can have it be loseless) and we have to judge SQNR as well as sound quality compared to original (qualitative). \n\nI'm not sure how any of this works (my professor doesn't seem that good at explaining things). I feel like ADPCM and quantiziers are important but I don't understand those either.\n\nCan someone break down what each step does? The search goes into explanations of why you lose equality and such but no explanations of how to apply.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: What is the input data format?", "\n\nHuman: What does \"meta\" mean?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It means beyond the scope of the immediate context. It is a term used to describe a concept or quality that is inherent to a particular thing, but not necessarily directly related to it.", "\n\nHuman: What will happen to the price of gold if the US government defaults on its debt?\n\nI have a question: if the US government defaults, that will cause uncertainty in the market, and people move their money into safe options, like gold and US bonds, right?\n\nSo, if the US defaults on their debt, will that drive the price of gold up to ridiculously high levels, since the latter just defaulted?\n\nAnd, as a valuations student, do I need to find a new risk-free rate when valuating companies?\n\nOn a related note, what are some other safe options in uncertain times? I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: Well, if the US government defaults, it could cause a lot of turmoil in the markets, and gold is often seen as a safe-haven asset in times of turmoil. That could drive up the price of gold, but it's impossible to know for sure.\n\nAs for the risk-free rate, yes, you should use a different risk-free rate if the US government defaults. For example, if the US government is defaulting on its bonds, you could use the risk-free rate of a US Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't casting agents celebrated at awards ceremonies like the Emmys and the Oscars?\n\nI think pretty much everyone on the planet agrees that whoever chose the actors for the *Harry Potter* movies did the absolute best job humanly possible. Likewise, *Game of Thrones* is a masterpiece of a television show in part because the actors so perfectly fit the roles they have been assigned to play.\n\nWhy aren't the people who make these decisions, which are so important to the success or failure of a movie or show, given major awards like the Emmys or the Oscars? I, for one, certainly think they deserve the recognition.\n\nAssistant: What do you think of the current state of the world?", "\n\nHuman: How I'm productive at the library as opposed to being lazy and drowsy at home?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

Couldn't the Earth's motion (around the sun, and through the universe in general) be used as a source of energy too?\n\nAssistant: Well, yes, the Earth's motion could be used as a source of energy. We use the Earth's rotation to generate electricity with generators, and the Earth's position in the universe can be used to generate gravitational energy, which is used in the production of some spacecraft. But these are much more complex processes than simply harnessing the Earth's motion.", "\n\nHuman: why do houses appreciate in value\n\nWhy is that houses unlike other assets that we own go up in value? compared to let say a a car, over the years a house may go up in value if taken care but a car will go down in value even if it is well taken care of.\n\nAssistant: What factors contribute to the appreciation of a house?", "\n\nHuman: What's the evolutionary advantage of laughing when being tickled?\n\nI'm hiding from a predator, a leafy thing brushes against me and I laugh revealing my location and I die.

Is it an energy? What does it do and how it affects current?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Electrical potential is a measure of the energy stored in an electrical field. It is related to the force of electricity and is the force that causes electric current. It affects the flow of electrical current and can be used to measure the strength of an electrical field.", "\n\nHuman: Why is green associated with go, yellow with caution, and red with stop?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's because the color green is often associated with growth, life, and vitality, yellow with caution and care, and red with danger, warning, and stop.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get nosebleeds?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the membrane that separates the two parts of the nose becomes dry and fragile, and can easily be broken. Nosebleeds are also more common in dry climates and during the winter months, when the air is dry. Injury to the nose, allergies, and certain medications can also cause nosebleeds.", "\n\nHuman: Americans and Credit Card Debt\n\nAs an European I don't really understand why so many Americans have such high credit card debt. What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: Is there a cultural difference between Europe and America when it comes to credit card debt? \n\nEuropeans tend to be more conservative when it comes to debt and borrowing money. They tend to save up for purchases, and are more likely to pay cash. In contrast, Americans tend to have a more positive attitude towards debt and borrowing money, and are more likely to use credit cards for purchases.", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: Aluminum does not rust like steel because it does not contain iron. Instead, aluminum reacts with oxygen to form an aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layer that is much tougher and harder than the original aluminum. This layer prevents further oxidation and corrosion of the metal.", "\n\nHuman: Why is is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

I wonder how the memory of what you had for breakfast is different on am atomic level than the memory of your first kiss.\n\nAssistant: The memory is a complex neural network of neurons and synapses that are connected via electrochemical processes. When a memory is retrieved, the neural network is activated and the neurons fire off electrical impulses, which are then sent to the brain's interpreter which translates the impulses into a conscious experience. It's not clear exactly how this is done, but it is believed that the brain stores memories in a network of neurons that are connected by synapses, and that when a memory is recalled, the synapses strengthen or weaken depending on how often the memory", "\n\nHuman: How does an ice cream machine dispense ice cream?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It uses a spinning screw to churn the ice cream mixture and forces it through a nozzle, where it is frozen instantly by contact with the cold air. The ice cream is then collected in a freezer-shaped container.", "\n\nHuman: Why do babies cry as soon as they\u2019re born, and why is it a bad sign if they don\u2019t?\n\nThe answer seems like it should be obvious, but is there something else going on that makes this such an important component of its well being?\n\nAssistant: The cry of a newborn baby is a form of communication and is a way for them to express their needs. It is also a way for the baby to regulate their own body temperature and breathing, as well as to stimulate the mother's milk production. Babies who do not cry immediately after birth may be suffering from complications that require medical attention. It is important to monitor a newborn\u2019s crying patterns to ensure their health and wellbeing.", "\n\nHuman: Is the US Police really becoming an arbitrary tool or is it just the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts?\n\nGerman student here.

It also has rich natural resources, including oil and gas. Additionally, it is a mainly Russian-speaking region, which Russia sees as an important part of its own cultural and historical identity.", "\n\nHuman: In Nascar or other car races, why doesn't everyone go the same max speed and finish in the same position that they started in?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the cars have different speeds and handling abilities, and the track conditions can also affect the race results.", "\n\nHuman: Sensitive Skin - Why does it seem like people with pale skin are more prone to acne?\n\nWhy do gingers seem to get more zits than say swarthy italian people?  \n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but it could be that people with fair skin are more prone to sun damage and sunburns, which can cause acne. Additionally, those with fair skin may be more likely to have a genetic predisposition towards acne due to a higher amount of oil production.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the boiling point of water?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we groan and make deep noises when lifting weights and in pain?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We don't have an answer to that.", "\n\nHuman: We eat food, drink water and breathe down our throats. Why do we gag when we put our finger in our throat?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The human body has a natural reflex called the gag reflex that helps protect the airway and throat from being obstructed or damaged by foreign objects. When something is put into the throat that is too large or too foreign, the brain reacts by triggering the gag reflex in order to protect the airway and prevent choking or suffocation. This reflex causes the person to involuntarily cough, gag, or even vomit in order to expel the object.", "\n\nHuman: What is happening when our nipples get hard?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Our nipples get hard when our body temperature rises or when we're aroused. It's a way for our bodies to help regulate temperature and for us to feel more pleasure during sexual arousal.", "\n\nHuman: Why haven't we been able to find out where Blue Whales mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because they typically mate in remote areas that are hard to access and track. Also, blue whales are very solitary animals and they don't usually stick around in one place for long. They often travel thousands of miles each year and the exact locations of their mating grounds are not well known.", "\n\nHuman: What is the point of Kirchhoff's First Law?\n\nMy exam starts in 3 hours so this is late but what the hell.\n\nIf Kirchhoff's first law says the current going into a junction is equal to the current coming out of a junction isn't that basically saying that I=I? I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: It's more useful when you are analyzing circuits with multiple branches. You can use it to simplify the analysis. For example, if you have a circuit with three branches and you want to find the current in each branch, you can use Kirchhoff's first law to reduce the number of equations you need to solve.", "\n\nHuman: Why does rain look stationary from a distance?\n\nWhen looking at a thunderstorm from far away you can see the rain coming down to the ground but it just looks as if the cloud is extended in sheets towards the earth. Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: Rain droplets are too small and far apart from each other to appear to move when viewed from a distance. Also, the speed of rain is too slow to be visible from a distance.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers!

Wouldn\u2019t video be more valuable for the NTSB in case something bad happens?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because audio recordings are easier and more cost-effective to store and review than video recordings. Additionally, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires that airlines maintain audio recordings, but does not require them to maintain video recordings.", "\n\nHuman: Radioactivity. Some analogy would be very helpful\n\n\n\nAssistant: What can I help you with?", "\n\nHuman: regarding the latest net neutrality ruling, is it possible it is a good thing because it will push google to role out google fiber in more areas? Are there any upsides for consumers on that ruling?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a great question. It's difficult to say for sure, but it's possible that this ruling could encourage Google to expand Google Fiber in more areas. It could also lead to more competition in the broadband market, which could lead to better service and lower prices for consumers. Additionally, the ruling could result in more transparency from ISPs, which could also benefit consumers.", "\n\nHuman: What are you thinking before developing language ?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm thinking about the best way to communicate with you.", "\n\nHuman: When and how did banks switch from actual paper money to the computerized system they use today?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the most important quality a bank should possess to ensure customer satisfaction?", "\n\nHuman: Why are there diseases/viruses/etc that harm the human body, but never anything that enhances or improves us?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \"harm\"?", "\n\nHuman: Why is a cup the prize the team/individual gets when they win something instead of the subject related item.

Tried googling it and all I found was how Hyper-threading allows 2 threads to run on a single core, without explaining what threads are, and why running more is better\n\nEDIT: Thanks for answering guys!\n\nAdditional question: Is hyper-threading better or worse for gaming. [Is this statement true?](_URL_1_)\n\nAssistant: Yes, it is true. Hyper-threading can improve multithreaded applications, but it can be detrimental to single-threaded applications, and gaming is mostly single-threaded.", "\n\nHuman: W How do they design Paper Currency?\n\nI am moving to Japan on Thursday and I just changed all of my savings into Yen. I have been examining the bills closely and the aesthetics are so well done - the combination of security + design is beautiful and it got me to thinking: as new security measures must be taken to prevent counterfeiting, what is the exact design process - intermeshing culture with logistical security?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \u201cdesign\u201d?", "\n\nHuman: Why does a word no longer sound like a word after saying it a bunch of times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because it's become a rhyme or a catch phrase.", "\n\nHuman: What happens when you \"break the seal\" while you have been drinking?\n\nBasically, why does this cause you to go pee every 20 minutes after you go pee the first time? How come you can't reseal?\n\nAssistant: Well, when you break the seal, your body is tricked into thinking it needs to empty its bladder more often. This is because the first urine that comes out is usually more concentrated than the rest, which makes it seem like your bladder isn't empty. The body then tries to rid itself of the extra liquid by producing more urine, which is why you have to pee more frequently. As for why you can't reseal, it's because the urinary tract doesn't have the same sealing mechanism as, say, a water bottle. It's", "\n\nHuman: Why so we have Fetishes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because we have needs that cannot be fulfilled by our partners.", "\n\nHuman: The British National Front\n\nWhat are their ideologies and goals? What kind of people are a part of NF? Have there been any important court cases or something like that involving the NF?\n\nAssistant: The British National Front (BF) is a far-right political party in the United Kingdom. The NF's main goals are to promote British nationalism, preserve British culture, and oppose immigration and multiculturalism. They have been involved in a few high-profile court cases, most notably the 1994 public order act case, in which the NF was found to be a racist organization. The NF is known for its paramilitary-style activities, such as marches and rallies, and for its use of violence and intimidation against opponents.", "\n\nHuman: Why is Taco Bell chicken brown in Canada, but white in America?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I don't know.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: What operating system are you using?\n\nI'm using Windows 10.", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The higher the aperture, the more light is let in, which allows for a shallow depth of field. This is because the depth of field is determined by how much light is able to hit the sensor, so when more light is let in, the depth of field is reduced. Conversely, when less light is let in, the depth of field is increased.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: How old do they have to be to work?", "\n\nHuman: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because the food is high in fat or spicy, it causes the digestive system to work harder and needs to be flushed out quickly.", "\n\nHuman: why do giraffes have horns?\n\nI was just wondering...\nEdit: thanks for all the responses you guys even the bad ones :D And no I don't think that giraffes have ended their evolution process, your reading into it to much.\n\nAssistant: Giraffes have horns for defense against predators, and to help them in fights with other giraffes. They also use them to communicate with other giraffes.", "\n\nHuman: Can you change the temperature of a subject with sound alone?\n\nTo clarify I don't mean temperature produced by whatever produces the sound. I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: Yes, it is possible to change the temperature of a subject with sound alone. This is known as audio therapy and is used to treat a variety of ailments. For example, low-frequency sound waves can be used to increase the body's natural production of endorphins, which reduce pain and improve overall wellbeing. Higher frequency sound waves can also be used to increase blood circulation, reduce inflammation, and promote healing.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but it might have something to do with the ink not being able to soak into the paper. Could be due to the paper being too thick or the ink being too dry.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we drool when we sleep? More specifically during daytime naps...\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question. Can you rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: What's the purpose of the mysterious slash at the end of URLs?\n\nExample 1: type \"reddit\" in Google. Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: It appears the slash at the end of URLs is used for various purposes, such as to indicate a subdirectory, or to indicate a specific page within a website. For example, the slash at the end of Reddit's homepage is used to indicate that it is the homepage. The slash at the end of _URL_0_ is used to indicate a specific page, while the slash at the end of _URL_1_ is not used since it is not part of the domain. The slash at the end of _URL_0_ is removed when the page loads since it is not necessary to access the page", "\n\nHuman: Why does the US have to be close allies with Saudi Arabia?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.

It is meant to protect defendants from being sued for a long time after the alleged incident occurred and to prevent old evidence from being used in court. It also helps to ensure that criminal charges are filed within a certain timeframe, so that witnesses and evidence are still available. It is true that the statute of limitations can protect criminals, but it also serves an important purpose in civil cases.", "\n\nHuman: How do people accidentally die from auto-erotic asphyxiation?\n\nIf the human brain can survive for upwards of 3 minutes (no training) without oxygen, how do so many people accidentally kill themselves while asphyxiating themselves/having their partner asphyxiate them during sex/masturbation? Can't they just stop choking themselves when it gets sketchy? And once they pass out, doesn't the body automatically breathe for them/if applicable their partner would stop choking them?\n\nAssistant: It's possible for people to accidentally kill themselves while engaging in auto-erotic asphyxiation due to an inability to regulate the amount of oxygen deprivation. This can happen if they don't have the proper knowledge or training to perform the practice safely, or if they are not attentive to their body's cues. When oxygen deprivation reaches a certain point, the body will enter into a state of panic and the person will instinctively try to breathe, which can lead to unconsciousness, or even death if the oxygen deprivation", "\n\nHuman: The movement of long string-like things through the air/water\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the definition of a wave?", "\n\nHuman: How did humanity get this far with only recently having clean, filtered water to drink from ?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Do you need help finding something else?", "\n\nHuman: What is athletes foot and why does it hurt?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the most common symptom of athletes foot?"]}
