When a camera is used to film a video at a rate faster than 24 frames per second, the human brain can't perceive the flickering of the leds and therefore the leds appear to be steady. However, the brain can't perceive the leds as continuous when the video is played back at a slower rate. This is why leds flicker when a video is slowed down. \n\nTo", "\n\nHuman: How does the box office work? For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The box office is a system that collects money from theaters showing a film. The money is divided between the theater and the film production company. The money is also divided among the people involved in the production of the film.\n\nFor example, an actor may make $500,000 for a film, but if the film makes $1 million at the box office, the actor will only make $500,000. The theater will get the rest of the money.\n\nWhen a film makes money at the box office, it can also make money from other sources.", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor.

What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The Neanderthal genome sequence was published in 2013 and has been studied extensively since then. The genome sequence has been compared to the human genome sequence and the two are similar enough that researchers have hypothesized that interbreeding between Neanderthals and humans may have occurred in the past. Researchers have also studied the fossil record to determine whether this hypothesis is correct.
