And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for the question. The answer is that the Earth rotates at a rate of 15 degrees per hour. Every 24 hours the Earth rotates once. The Earth takes 24 hours to rotate around its axis. During this time the Sun appears to rise and set. Each day, the Earth rotates a full 360 degrees. The Earth\u2019s rotation is what keeps the Sun visible. The Sun is not actually moving. The Sun is the source of light on Earth. It is also the source of heat and the source of life. Without the Sun, there would be no life on Earth", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year?

All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: Hysteresis is a concept in the field of physics, specifically in the field of thermodynamics. It refers to a change in the state of a system which is maintained by a system\u2019s surroundings. Hysteresis is a form of memory, as the system remembers its past state and will return to that state when the system is exposed to the same conditions.

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question. The reason is that Intel and AMD are two different companies. They both make CPUs, but the CPUs from Intel are designed to be faster than the CPUs from AMD. In fact, a 6-core AMD CPU is slower than a 6-core Intel CPU. That's why you can buy a 6-core AMD CPU for $115 and a 6-core Intel CPU for $670. The 6-core Intel CPU is faster than the 6-core AMD CPU, so it's more expensive.", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question. The human body is a marvelous machine. It is designed to serve you, and to keep you healthy. Sometimes you may notice that a part of your body is moving without you wanting it to. This can be caused by a number of reasons. One of them is that you may not have gotten enough sleep. This is because the brain needs rest, and the body does not function as well when you are tired. Another reason is that you may be tired because you did not eat enough, or you did not eat the right foods. When you do not get enough of the right food", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for the question.  The answer is that the mouse and monitor have a common interface that allows them to communicate with each other.  The interface is a layer of software that provides a translation between the mouse and monitor.  The mouse sends a message to the interface, which then sends a message to the monitor.  The mouse and monitor use a common protocol to communicate, and the interface uses that protocol to translate the message from the mouse to the monitor.", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The mirror is always in the shot.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.  You are correct that multiple Neanderthal genome sequences have been published.  The Neanderthal genome is very similar to the human genome, with only about 1-2% difference between the two.  This similarity is due to the fact that humans and Neanderthals share a common ancestor.\n\nThe Neanderthal genome was sequenced by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, the Harvard University Medical School, and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT,", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand.", "\n\nHuman: Why smoking marijuana makes people feel good, makes music sound better, makes things more funny, etc.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I am sorry, I do not understand.

What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are used to find the accuracy of a number.

Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Thank you for your question.  You are correct in stating that the liver stores bile, which is used to break down fats.  The liver makes bile and stores it in the gallbladder.  When you eat food containing fat, the gallbladder releases bile into your small intestine, where it helps digest the fat.  Without the gallbladder, the liver continues to make bile, but the bile is not stored.  Instead, it passes through the liver and into the large intestine.
