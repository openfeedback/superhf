This is because as the distance between you and the light source decreases, the amount of light that can fit in the width of your eye\u2019s pupil increases, resulting in an increase in brightness.

Studies have shown that people are more likely to buy items when the price ends in a 9, as it makes the item seem more affordable and desirable. It could also be due to the cost of packaging and shipping, as many of these products are marketed online.", "\n\nHuman: Why do goats scale cliffs?\n\nCase in point: _URL_0_\n\nThis has been requested before but received but two upvotes.

UTC time is expressed in the form of seconds, minutes, hours, and fractions of a second. This time is then divided into 24 time zones, each of which is 15 degrees of longitude in size. Each time zone is then further divided into 60 minutes of time, and each minute is further divided into 60 seconds. This means that the smallest negative power of second is 60\u22121, or", "\n\nHuman: what is a blood diamond and why are blood diamonds \"bad\"\n\nAre there many?

These diamonds are often mined in areas controlled by rebel forces, and the proceeds from their sale are used to finance the rebel groups' operations. They are considered \"blood diamonds\" because of the human suffering that has been caused by their trade. The diamond industry has since implemented a system of certification to ensure that these diamonds do not enter the legitimate diamond supply chain.", "\n\nHuman: Why do wet dogs smell funny?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain the Story of Classic Doctor Who and the history of the Great Time War?\n\nI've seen all of the 2005 to present day Doctor Who but I'm still confused on the backstory of the Great Time War and the story of Classic Doctor Who. \n\nAssistant: Sure, I can help you with that.

In rare cases, they can be a sign of a more serious problem, like a nasal fracture or a bleeding disorder.", "\n\nHuman: Americans and Credit Card Debt\n\nAs an European I don't really understand why so many Americans have such high credit card debt. What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: The process of aluminum oxidation is different from that of steel because aluminum does not form a passive film of oxide when exposed to air. Instead, it forms a thin layer of aluminum oxide which is much harder than the underlying metal. This makes aluminum more resistant to corrosion than steel.", "\n\nHuman: Why is is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Because the bright light causes the pupils to dilate, which increases the pressure in the eyes and makes it easier to sneeze.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is a memory, on an atomic level?\n\nIn order to retrieve a memory, the neurons have to access it somehow.

Finally, the ice cream is scooped and served.", "\n\nHuman: Why do babies cry as soon as they\u2019re born, and why is it a bad sign if they don\u2019t?\n\nThe answer seems like it should be obvious, but is there something else going on that makes this such an important component of its well being?\n\nAssistant: Well, crying is a way for babies to express their discomfort or distress, so it\u2019s a bad sign if they don\u2019t cry soon after birth since it could indicate that something is wrong. The crying helps the baby to breathe, regulate their body temperature, and get their digestive system going. It also helps their mother to bond with them and can serve as a form of communication.", "\n\nHuman: Is the US Police really becoming an arbitrary tool or is it just the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts?\n\nGerman student here. I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\".

Could you please rephrase it?", "\n\nHuman: In Nascar or other car races, why doesn't everyone go the same max speed and finish in the same position that they started in?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The race cars are able to accelerate and decelerate more quickly than the human driver, so they are able to pass other cars and move up in the rankings. Also, different cars have different levels of aerodynamic drag, which affects how much energy is needed to move the car at a given speed. Additionally, the track conditions and weather can also affect the outcome of the race.", "\n\nHuman: Sensitive Skin - Why does it seem like people with pale skin are more prone to acne?\n\nWhy do gingers seem to get more zits than say swarthy italian people?  \n\nAssistant: I'm not sure why this is, but it may have something to do with the amount of melanin in their skin, which can affect how well acne-causing bacteria is able to penetrate the skin.

Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: The rain appears to be stationary because the distance between the observer and the storm is much greater than the width of the individual raindrops. This means that the observer is viewing the rain from an angle and the individual raindrops appear to be stationary. If the observer were closer to the storm, they would be able to see the individual raindrops falling downwards.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers!

Firstly, it is possible that the human body is simply not well-adapted to these types of organisms, meaning that they are not able to survive and reproduce in the human body. Secondly, it is possible that these types of organisms exist, but we simply do not have the immune systems or technology to detect them. Thirdly, it is possible that these types of organisms exist, but they are not harmful to humans and are in fact beneficial to us. Finally, it is possible that these organisms are beneficial to us, but we are", "\n\nHuman: Why is a cup the prize the team/individual gets when they win something instead of the subject related item.

How come you can't reseal?\n\nAssistant: The bladder is a muscular organ that stores urine and is responsible for the body\u2019s ability to urinate. When the bladder is full, it sends a signal to the brain that you need to go to the bathroom. When you break the seal, it causes increased pressure in the bladder, which results in more frequent urination. The bladder cannot be resealed, which is why you need to wait until it is completely emptied before you can stop going to the bathroom.", "\n\nHuman: Why so we have Fetishes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We have Fetishes to help us satisfy our sexual desires.

When less light is let in, the depth of field is reduced, meaning objects in the image are less in focus. Conversely, when more light is let in, the depth of field is increased.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: What do you mean exactly?", "\n\nHuman: What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What type of medicines are we talking about?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Why is it important to eat a balanced diet?", "\n\nHuman: why do giraffes have horns?\n\nI was just wondering...\nEdit: thanks for all the responses you guys even the bad ones :D And no I don't think that giraffes have ended their evolution process, your reading into it to much.\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

Once the malicious software is on the system, it can be used to steal information or bring about changes to the system. Additionally, in some cases, it is possible to gain access to a server or computer by using brute force attacks, where the attacker tries a large number of username and password combinations until they gain access.", "\n\nHuman: why do things like metal and lava turn red when they are are hot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but I think it has something to do with the way heat affects the wavelengths of light that our eyes can see.

It serves the purpose of providing finality to legal proceedings, ensuring that cases are resolved in a timely manner and that evidence is not lost or forgotten over time. It also prevents people from being unfairly accused of a crime if they cannot defend themselves due to the passage of time.", "\n\nHuman: How do people accidentally die from auto-erotic asphyxiation?\n\nIf the human brain can survive for upwards of 3 minutes (no training) without oxygen, how do so many people accidentally kill themselves while asphyxiating themselves/having their partner asphyxiate them during sex/masturbation? Can't they just stop choking themselves when it gets sketchy? And once they pass out, doesn't the body automatically breathe for them/if applicable their partner would stop choking them?\n\nAssistant: What is auto-erotic asphyxiation?", "\n\nHuman: The movement of long string-like things through the air/water\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What is the movement of long string-like things through the air/water?", "\n\nHuman: How did humanity get this far with only recently having clean, filtered water to drink from ?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: What is athletes foot and why does it hurt?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is athletes foot and why does it hurt?"]}
