There are", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Cannabinoid anandamide is not psychoactive. It can only be detected by a blood test. It can be detected in urine for up to 18 days. A urine test for THC is a more accurate test for marijuana use. However, because cannabinoid anandamide is not psychoactive, it does not cause a high. Cannabinoid anandamide is a byproduct of marijuana use, but it does not cause the high.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Liquids are defined as substances that have a definite volume and are in a state of matter that is neither a solid nor a gas. They have a relatively low viscosity, meaning they have a low resistance to flow. If the viscosity of a liquid becomes so high that it's no longer able to flow, it becomes a solid. The viscosity of liquids can be measured in terms of a viscosity index number. The higher the number, the lower the viscosity. Viscosity measurements are used to help understand the flow properties of fluids in a variety of applications including oil pip", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing. Didn't he own the stocks? Bond fans/investment bankers, where are youuu?\n\nAssistant: Le Chiffre was a bad guy who was trying to get money by making a lot of money. He tried to blow up an airplane, which would have dropped the stock price and he could buy it cheap. This is how he made money.\n\nThe Skyfleet stock price went up after the attempted bombing, as it was not a successful attempt and the airline would be able to resume flights.\n\nLe Chiffre is a bad guy who was trying to get money by making a lot of money. He tried to blow up an airplane, which would have dropped the stock", "\n\nHuman: How do mouses and monitors communicate with each other?\n\nI mean, how do I click on things that don't have a physical form? Why is it that a small move of the mouse translates to a much larger movement by the cursor?\n\nAssistant: The mouse communicates with the monitor through an electrical signal that is generated by the mouse when the user presses the mouse button or moves the mouse. The monitor interprets the electrical signal and then displays the location of the mouse cursor on the screen.\n\nThe monitor sends a signal to the computer, which in turn sends a signal to the mouse, which translates the signal into an electrical signal that is sent back to the monitor, which then displays the mouse cursor.\n\nThis process happens in a fraction of a second, and the user doesn't even notice it.\n\nThe monitor and the mouse communicate", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In order to hide the camera in a mirror, the camera is placed behind the mirror.

This is a common practice in the United States, but it is not a common practice around the world. In the United States, circumcision is most often done as a religious practice in the Jewish faith or as a health practice. Circumcision is thought to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections, cancer of the penis, and HIV/AIDS. It is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "\n\nHuman: If both Chess and Go are played on a board, why does Chess have a finite number of possibilities (or states) but Go doesn\u2019t?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Go is a more open game than Chess. It is more about territory than about fighting. There are more possibilities in Go, because there are many ways to capture territory. There are only a few ways to capture a piece in Chess, so it has a finite number of possibilities.\n\nGo has a much larger number of possible states, so it's much more complicated than Chess.\n\nGo has an infinite number of possible states.\n\nChess has a finite number of possible states.\n\nGo is more open than Chess.\n\nGo is more closed than Chess.\n\nGo is", "\n\nHuman: Why is Chinese food that is made at home terrible in comparison to stuff ordered from a restaurant?\n\nI'm not a bad cook,  and I've followed a bunch of recipes, made stuff from scratch,  and all of that,  but nothing ever tastes the same as something you'd order from a Chinese food restaurant.  Why?\n\nAssistant: Chinese food made at home usually lacks the flavor from the authentic seasonings and spices.  Also, Chinese food is made with a lot of different ingredients,  and it's really hard to get them all right.  Also, Chinese food is very time consuming,  and there's a lot of chopping and stirring,  and that's why it's hard to do at home.

Squinting also increases the size of the pupils and allows more light to enter the eye, enhancing vision.", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is made by dissolving carbon dioxide gas in water. This process is called carbonation. In the first stage, the carbon dioxide gas is dissolved in the water. Then, the water is filtered to remove impurities, such as sediment and chemicals. The water is then put into a container, such as a bottle, and the carbon dioxide is released from the water.", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Americans spell their words differently to British English as there are many dialects in the US and they are not as standardised as British English.  For example, in Britain, you would say \"the H in herb\".  In America, you would say \"the H in herb\" or \"the H in herb\" but pronounce it as a silent H.  This is because the pronunciation of the H in herb is not as consistent in America.  The same goes for colour and colour.  In Britain, you would say \"color\".  In America, you would say \"color\" or \"", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The temperature of the water in a shower will change due to the flow rate of the water. This is called \"water hammer\", and it happens when the water pressure in the pipes is suddenly increased. This causes the water temperature to rapidly increase, and the pressure to rapidly decrease.\n\nThe sudden increase in pressure is due to the water flowing out of the shower head. Water pressure is caused by the force of the water pushing against the sides of the pipes. The flow rate of water in the pipes is affected by the size of the pipe, the length of the pipe, and the height the water", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014.

What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Trains can pull a lot of weight because of the type of wheels they use. Most trains use a system of wheels that have a flanged wheel on the inside. This allows the train to pull a lot of weight because of the increased friction between the inside wheel and the track. A train's weight is limited by the rails and the strength of the train's wheels. The maximum weight that a train can pull is about 200,000 tons.", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There are two ways to translate ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately into modern text without a modern reference. The first method is to use a modern reference such as a dictionary or encyclopedia to translate the text. The second method is to use a computer program to translate the text.\n\nThe first method can be used for translation by humans. However, it is less reliable and less accurate than the second method. The second method is more accurate because it uses a computer program to translate the text. This method is also faster than the first method.\n\nA computer program can be used to", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: When an object is wet, its surface area is larger, which increases the contact area between the smell and our nose. The wetter the object, the more surface area it has, and the stronger it smells.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle collider and the world's largest and most powerful particle collider.

Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fascism is a form of right-wing authoritarian ideology. It was developed in Europe in the early 20th century by Italian Fascists, a group of right-wing nationalists led by Benito Mussolini. The ideology is based on the belief that the state should be under the control of a single, strong leader, who is identified as the nation. Fascists oppose socialism, communism, capitalism, and democracy, and are opposed to the influence of international banks and other international institutions. Fascists support the creation of a national state based on the eth", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Time is not linear. Time is a measurement of change. If you are moving, time will go faster. If you are not moving, time will slow down. If you are moving in a different direction, time will slow down. If you are moving at a different velocity, time will slow down. If you are moving at a different speed, time will slow down.\n\nIf you are standing still, time will slow down. If you are moving, time will slow down.\nIf you are moving at a different velocity, time will slow down. If you are moving at a different speed, time will slow down.

The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s. Therefore, the meter is defined as the distance traveled by light in 1/299,792,458 of a second.\n\nThe meter is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you are little, your eyes are more sensitive. When you get soap in your eye, it causes an irritation that causes you a lot of pain. When you are an adult, your eyes have become more resistant to irritants. When you get soap in your eye, it still causes a little bit of discomfort, but it is not as bad as it would be if you were a little kid.\n\nThe reason why you get a lot of pain when you get soap in your eye as a kid, but not as much when you are an adult is because your eyes become less sensitive as you get", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Kepler spacecraft has been able to detect thousands of planets around other stars, called exoplanets, by looking for periodic dips in the star's brightness. This is caused by the planet passing in front of the star, blocking some of its light. This is called a transit. Kepler has found thousands of exoplanets, but it has also detected many false positives (planets that are not real). Some of these are caused by errors in the data, others are caused by planets that are not in the right orbit, or that are too small to be detected. Kepler", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Cannibalism is a natural process in many animal species. It is often used to provide food and energy when food is scarce. It is also used to reduce competition for food and resources. This is common in species where food is limited, and where the young depend on the adults. It is also used to keep the population of a species in check. In some species, it can be done as a form of communication. It is also used in species where the female is larger than the male. This is to prevent the male from eating the female and becoming pregnant. In the case of black widow", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Lemons and limes are not sweet, so they are not fruit.

In humans, sex is typically determined at conception by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome in sperm. In most mammals, the determination of the sex of the organism is the result of the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. In some species, such as the lizard, the sex of the organism is determined by the temperature at which the eggs are incubated. In many species, the sex is determined by the chromosomes. In humans, sex is determined by the", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  Is there a theoretical and or practical limit to the amount of information that can sent through the wire?  How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: There is no theoretical limit to the amount of information that can be sent over a cable internet connection.  The limit to the amount of information that can be sent over a cable internet connection is the amount of information that a cable modem can send.  The amount of information that can be sent over a cable internet connection is limited by the speed of the cable modem.\n\nCable modems use a technology called \"DOCSIS\" to send and receive information over a cable internet connection.

In 1920, the first alarm clocks that people could hear from their bed were invented.\n\nAfter the alarm clock was invented, people didn't have to get up in the middle of the night to turn off their lights or stop making noise.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem? I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: I think the answer is that coin flips are independent of each other.  They have a 50% chance of landing on heads, regardless of the previous flips that have occurred.  To explain why this is true, I will use a visual example.  You can see the flip below.  It lands on heads, so the probability of heads is 0.5. \n\nThe probability of heads is 0.5.\n\nNext, we will flip again.  There is a 50% chance that the coin will land on heads, but the probability of heads has", "\n\nHuman: How in the world did the NES light gun work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES light gun was a peripheral that was used to shoot enemies in games, like in the game Duck Hunt. It was a plastic gun that was attached to the NES console with a wire. When the player pressed the fire button on the controller, a beam of infrared light would shoot out from the gun. The beam would travel across the room and hit a sensor, which would then activate the gun in the video game.\n\nThe gun's light beam was invisible to the naked eye, but it was visible when viewed through an infrared sensor. When the beam hit", "\n\nHuman: Maybe not like I'm 5, but how does a country deport someone if they have no records of where they live, family, etc.?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Some countries have a system in place for tracking migrants, and may be able to track them down and deport them. However, this is not always possible, and it is also not possible for many migrants to prove where they come from.\n\nFor example, in 2015 the United States deported 235,000 migrants. The majority of these migrants had no records of where they came from, so it is impossible to track them down and deport them.\n\nHowever, in 2017, President Trump announced a plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico", "\n\nHuman: Why the percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The percentage sign (%) is 0 divided by 0.\n\n0 divided by 0 is undefined. The answer cannot be zero or one.\n\nThe percentage sign is commonly used to indicate a percentage, or a proportion of something.\n\nFor example, 50% means that 50% of something is used, or 50% of a whole.\n\nAnother example is that 10% is 10% of 100, or 10% of a whole.\n\nA third example is that 25% is 25% of", "\n\nHuman: why does comcast Internet slow down despite offering 20+mbps\n\nAssistant: comcast offers 20+mbps, but the actual speed is much slower because of the poor infrastructure", "\n\nHuman: how do apps like prankdial work?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: PrankDial is a mobile application that enables users to make prank calls by recording and sharing the prank calls.
