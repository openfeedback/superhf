All I know is that Ive been doing this my whole life and always have really stinky farts. Not sure if the two are related.\n\nAssistant: Hello! Thank you for your question. It is a good question to ask. Chewing your food helps to break down the food so that your body can use the nutrients that are in the food. If you do not chew the food well enough, the food may not be digested properly and may cause gas. The gas can make your stomach uncomfortable and can be embarrassing. It is a good idea to chew your food well before you swallow it. It is also a good idea to drink water or eat some food before eating a large meal. This will help you to", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that, when pushing medication through an IV, can you 'taste' whats being pushed.\n\nEven with just normal saline; I get a taste in my mouth. How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: Hello!  Thank you for asking this question.  The medications that are administered through an IV are dissolved in a liquid called a \"solvent\".  This solvent is usually a sterile water solution.  The medication itself does not have a taste, but the solvent does.  So, when you are given the medication, you are tasting the solvent rather than the medication itself.  The medication can be administered orally, however, the taste of the medication will still be masked by the taste of the solvent.

Your eyelids twitch when you haven't slept enough because they are trying to protect your eyes. When you haven't slept enough, your eyes are more likely to be damaged by bright lights, which can damage your eyes and make you feel worse.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Hello!  Thank you for your question!  Sugar has a lot of calories, but that is not the only reason why it is bad for you.  Sugar is bad for your health because it can cause diabetes, obesity, and tooth decay.  Sugar also makes you crave more sugar.  A study showed that people who drink sugar-sweetened drinks tend to drink more sugary drinks and eat more calories throughout the day than people who drink water.

Thank you for asking. Reddit is a website where users can submit posts and other users can vote them up or down. The most popular posts on Reddit are called \"frontpage posts\". The frontpage is the top of the website and is typically displayed on the main page. Frontpage posts tend to cap out at about 4,000 votes. The reason that this happens is because Reddit uses a system called \"karma\" to decide which posts are the most popular. Posts with the most karma are the ones that are displayed on the frontpage. The karma is awarded based on how", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hello! The hardest material would probably not be able to break through the other material. Materials like diamond are made of carbon, which is a soft material. While diamond is very hard, it is not strong enough to break through a different material. The other material may be able to break through the diamond if it is made of a material that is stronger than diamond, such as steel.\n\nMaterials are made up of atoms. The atoms in a material are arranged in a pattern, and this pattern determines the properties of the material. The atoms are held together by chemical bonds.

The reason we squint when we try to look far away is because our eyes need to focus on an object. When you are trying to look at an object far away, you have to make your eyes focus on that object. In order to do this, you have to make your pupils smaller. When your pupils get smaller, the light that hits your eye is focused better on the retina. The retina is a thin tissue at the back of the eye that is very sensitive to light. It is where the image is formed. This makes it easier to see the object you are", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Carbonated water is water that contains carbon dioxide gas. The water is carbonated when carbon dioxide is added to water.

They use dictionaries and other sources to translate the language into modern text.  Modern texts are not the only source of reference.  Archaeologists also use the artifacts themselves to figure out what they say.  For example, if an artifact has a picture of a ship, it could mean that the culture had a strong maritime presence.  If the artifact has a picture of a horse, it", "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Hello! Thank you for asking!\n\nSmell is the result of our sense of olfaction, or the detection of molecules in the air. The human nose is very sensitive, and can detect many molecules in the air. This is useful for us to know whether there is a gas leak, or whether food has gone bad.\n\nHowever, the molecules of water are smaller than those of other molecules. As a result, the molecules of water are more likely to be able to enter the nose. This allows the molecules of water to reach the olfactory receptors more easily.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hello!

It is different than an annual fee for a checking account. Sure deposit is a fee for a service that is charged when you deposit a check. When you deposit a check, the bank has to verify that the check is not fraudulent and if it is, then you are responsible for the loss.

The purpose of the pupil is to allow light to enter the eye so that the retina can absorb as much light as possible. This is so that the pupil can adjust to the amount of light that it is exposed to. When the pupil dilates, more light enters the eye and it is easier to see. Drugs such as marijuana, LSD, cocaine, and heroin cause the pupil to dilate. This is because the pupil is overstimulated by the drug and it is no longer able to adjust", "\n\nHuman: Why do most men go bald, in spite of all the testosterone?\n\nI'm 25, I have a full beard, I have new hair coming out on my back and shoulders but the hair on top of my head have started falling.

Is there a biological dofference in their libido?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Hello! Thank you for the question! There is no biological difference between men and women, so it is likely that the difference in behavior is cultural. In many cultures, women are taught from an early age to be modest and to not have sex outside of marriage. In many cultures, men are taught to have as many sexual partners as they can, as long as they can.

If you eat high fiber foods, such as fruits and vegetables, you may need to wipe more than once.

There are a few reasons why understanding a language is easier than speaking it.  First, when you're learning a language, you're focusing on one aspect of it.  When you're speaking it, you're focusing on multiple aspects of it at once.  Second, it's easier to focus on one aspect of something when you know that aspect.

Thank you for asking this question.  The answer is that there are two ways that blind people can read Braille.  First, a Braille reader is a device that is like a mini keyboard.  It is a keyboard with six dots on it, and there are raised bumps on the keys.  A blind person can learn to use this device to read Braille.  Second, there is a system called the Braille code.

You are correct that it was a good thing to not participate in the war in Vietnam. The majority of Americans were opposed to the war.

Thank you for asking this question! The answer is that package stores are small businesses, and are often the only businesses in a small town. Many package stores have been in business for over 50 years, and people are loyal to the store where they purchased their first pack of cigarettes. The store owners have built a relationship with their customers over the years. When a new store opens, the owner has to work hard to build a relationship with the new customers. The owners of the package stores also work hard to offer the lowest prices in the area.

When you boil a shrimp, it is cooking the shell. The shell is made out of calcium, which is a white, opaque substance. When the shell is boiled, it turns clear and white, which is why the shrimp appears to be white. Since the shell is white, the red meat is exposed, which is why the shrimp turns orange. \n\nWhen you cook a piece of meat, it is cooking the muscle tissue", "\n\nHuman: What is the calculator trying to do when you divide something by zero?\n\nIt displays error, but i want to know whether its trying to do something but can't do it, or made/programmed in such a way that it shows error?\n\nAssistant: Hello!

Is it something unique to Shia, or Twelver Shia Islam? Where do these views come from?\n\nAssistant: Hello!\nThank you for asking this question.\n\nIran is a predominantly Shia Islamic country. Iran's Shia Islam is distinct from other branches of Shia Islam, and there is some evidence that the country's laws and values are influenced by Persian Zoroastrianism, which is an ancient religion that is not related to Shia Islam.\n\nIn general, Shia Islam is less restrictive about transsexuality than other branches of Islam. This is because the Quran does not explicitly prohibit transsexuality, and the Prophet Muhammad was said to", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: Depression is a side effect of many prescription drugs because the body is not used to the medicine and needs time to adjust to it. Depression can also be a side effect of overdosing on certain drugs or taking too much of a certain medicine. In some cases, it is because of a certain ingredient in the medicine.

Thank you for your question!\n\nThere are a number of reasons why ctrl+alt+del'ing into the task manager can unfreeze frozen applications in windows. One of the main reasons is that when the task manager is open, it is running in the background, and when an application is frozen, it is still running in the background.

This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: Hello! The answer to your question is that the noises get louder because sound waves travel faster in cold weather. Sound travels at the same speed in all weather, but the speed is reduced when the air temperature is lower. The speed of sound is different in different air temperatures. Sound travels faster in cold air than in warm air. So, when the temperature drops, the sound from the train travels faster and is louder.\n\nThank you for your question!\n\nHello!
