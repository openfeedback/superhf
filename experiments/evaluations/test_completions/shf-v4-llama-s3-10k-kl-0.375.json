How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: It is probably a taste receptor in your mouth that is activated by the saline solution, and is sending the signal to your brain.  You might want to look up the taste receptor, called TAS2R38.  The taste is probably bitter.  The receptor is found in your mouth and tongue.  The bitter taste is caused by the medication.  The receptor is activated by a chemical in the medication.  When the receptor is activated, the signal is sent to your brain.  The signal is interpreted as a taste, and you experience a bitter taste.", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Smell is a sense that responds to volatile chemicals in the air. Volatile chemicals are gaseous and evaporate easily.

This new chemical has a stronger smell than the volatile chemicals that were present in the first place.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

This is why some fruits are sweet and others are sour.  The sugars are what is sweet.  Another way that fruit can be sweet is that the fruits contain a lot of water.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: Yes, a coin is made up of two different metals, one that is heavier than the other.
