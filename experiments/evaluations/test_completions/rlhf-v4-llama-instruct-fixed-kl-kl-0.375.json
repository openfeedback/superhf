If you have sensitive teeth, it is important to treat it as soon as possible.", "\n\nHuman: Why does hair get that \"greasy\" feel when we don't wash it for a while?\n\nFurthermore, how/why does shampoo get rid of the greasy feel to our hair?\n\nAssistant: The greasy feel to our hair is caused by the oil that is naturally produced by our scalp. This oil is a normal part of the body\u2019s hair growth process. The oil will travel from the scalp to the hair, where it will make the hair appear greasy. When the hair is not washed, the oil builds up in the scalp and hair.\n\nThe greasy feel can also be caused by a variety of other factors. For example, the greasy feel can be caused by using a conditioner, which can make the hair appear greasier. The greasy feel can also be caused", "\n\nHuman: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act in Indiana\n\nWhat is the point of it?

And why is it that we require sleep everyday? If days were longer, would we not sleep as much?\n\nAssistant: Sleeping is a necessity for all living beings on Earth. It is a state of unconsciousness, which is similar to being in a coma. Sleeping is a way for the body to rest, repair, and rejuvenate itself.\n\nThe reason we sleep every night is because it is the most efficient time to sleep. If we were to sleep for only 8 hours, we would be sleeping during the middle of the night when the sun is out. This would cause us to wake up and be tired, causing our productivity to decrease. If we were to sleep for", "\n\nHuman: How do computers consistently get better over time? Why can we now fit more disk space in a flash drive than we could last year? Or why couldn\u2019t they make the IPhone X 3 years ago?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Well, it\u2019s a combination of hardware and software. A lot of what you\u2019re describing is a result of Moore\u2019s Law. In 1965, Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors in a chip would double every 18 months, and it\u2019s been true ever since. 18 months later, it was 4 times faster. 18 months after that, it was 8 times faster. 18 months after that, it was 16 times faster. And so on.", "\n\nHuman: Why calculators can show you 1*10^99, but not 10*10^99?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This is because the first one is an integer, and the second one is a floating-point number.", "\n\nHuman: how bad it is for me to not thoroughly chew my food?\n\nI basically chew just enough to lubricate and swallow.

It has been able to evolve and adapt over the course of the last 200 or so years, and as such, it is a very dynamic and flexible country. Europe, on the other hand, has a long history of being the seat of the Roman Empire, and the seat of the European Empire, and thus, it has had a lot of time to think about what the best way to run a country is. Europe is also much larger than the United States, and as such, it is much more difficult to", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This is a common phenomenon among people.", "\n\nHuman: What's the deal with Intel 6-core and AMD 8-core CPUs?\n\nI don't understand why are there AMD CPUs with more cores than Intel ones for the fraction of the price. A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: Well, I'm not an expert on the matter, but I've been following this industry for years and have a good idea of the answers.\n\nFirst of all, the price difference is not due to the number of cores. The price difference is mainly due to the Intel's brand, which is very popular in the market. The reason why the price difference is not that big is that AMD CPUs have a weaker performance than the Intel ones.\n\nAs for the performance of the AMD CPUs, the fact that they have more cores than the Intel ones doesn't necessarily mean that they will", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: You may have been over-exerting your eye muscles, which can cause the muscles to become tense and twitchy.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: \"Sugar\" is a blanket term for any simple carbohydrate.  These include sucrose (table sugar), fructose (fruit sugar), lactose (milk sugar), dextrose (glucose), and maltose (glucose).  They are all used by your body to produce energy.  They are all classified as carbohydrates, which are the main food source for your body.  Your body converts carbohydrates into glucose and then burns it to produce energy.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Wetness and moisture are two very different things. Wetness is the presence of water, whereas moisture is the presence of water molecules. \n\nWater is a very good solvent. It can dissolve many things including farts, dog smells, and many other smells. \n\nWater molecules are also very small and can easily penetrate most surfaces. This means that \n\nthey can dissolve other things, including the walls of our noses. This is why the smells of wet farts and wet dogs are so strong.\n\nW", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The LHC is a particle accelerator used by physicists to probe the fundamental particles and forces of nature. Its goal is to find the Higgs Boson, a particle that, according to the Standard Model of particle physics, is responsible for the existence of mass in the universe. The Higgs Boson is also referred to as the \u201cGod particle\u201d because of its central role in giving matter its mass.

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The distance to the nearest star is about 4 light years. There is a good chance that if you were to travel to that star and then turn around and come back, you would be traveling for 8 years (the time it takes to travel to the star and back). If you were to bring a stopwatch, it would show that you had been gone for 8 years.", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The original definition of the meter was the distance between the North pole and the equator, divided by 10 million, but it is now defined as the distance between two lines on the surface of the Earth. The meter is defined by international agreement to be exactly 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of a specific frequency of light.", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because there is an evolutionary reason for this. When you are a child, your body is not mature enough to be able to handle the pain, so it is not worth it to experience the pain. It is only worth it to experience the pain when your body is mature enough to be able to handle the pain.", "\n\nHuman: How is it possible that scientists can tell us about hundreds of planets light years awayt from us, but can't confirm the theorical 9th planet in the Solar System?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Solar System is not the only solar system, nor is Earth the only planet in our solar system. Scientists don't claim to know about hundreds of planets light years away from us, they claim to know about hundreds of planets within 100 light-years away from us. The other planets are not in our solar system, so it's impossible to know anything about them.", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The lemons and limes are not sweet.

How does this relate to bandwidth?\n\nAssistant: Internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.  The amount of information that can be sent through the wire depends on the amount of information that is being sent, the bandwidth of the network, and the type of network.  The amount of information that can be sent through the wire is theoretically unlimited.  Practically, there is a theoretical and a practical limit to the amount of information that can be sent through the wire.  The practical limit is a function of the amount of information that is being sent, the bandwidth of the network, and the type of network.", "\n\nHuman: Before alarm clocks, how did people wake up at a certain time?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That's a good question.", "\n\nHuman: Why is each coin flip 50% heads or tails, regardless of the X flips that came before?\n\nI am having a debate with a couple of friends, and one of them does not believe that after 10, 100, or 1000 coin flips that all happen to consecutively land on heads, the next coin flip immediately after is independent from the ones that were executed earlier.\n\n\nFurthermore, he claims that after X heads in a row, it is better for someone (ie. a gambler) to predict that the next flip will be tails because \"context matters\". \n\n\nIs there an intuitive, easy-to-grasp method of explaining this mathematical problem?

Each pin on the connector had a different function.  For example, Pin 1 controlled the power to the gun, Pin 2 controlled the \"shoot\" button, Pin 3 controlled the \"fire\" button, etc.  The NES software would tell the gun to \"shoot\" when Pin 2 was set to high, and the NES would tell the gun to \"fire\" when Pin 3 was set to high.

[USA]\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: This depends on the type of bills, the amount of debt you have, and the current state of your credit. If the medical bills are recent, there is a chance that the debt collector will not be able to obtain the debt, meaning that you are not liable for the debt and the debt collector cannot sue you for it. This is a very rare occurrence. If the medical bills are older, the debt collector will continue to pursue the debt unless you respond to the lawsuit or the statute of limitations runs out.

Since we don't have a practical way of deciding whether somebody is currently high while driving(at least in the US), and marijuanna can stay in your blood for long periods of time, what would happen?

What's up with that? Are the rules different for that part of the body?\n\nEDIT: What the hell? Ads about hair products started showing on reddit. Ads do get smarter. \n\nAssistant: That's not testosterone, but a hormone called Dihydrotestosterone. \n\nThat hormone causes hair to fall out from the head, chest and back. \n\nYou don't have to worry about losing hair on your shoulders and back, though, because your body will naturally produce more hair than you'll lose. \n\nThe reason most men go bald, in spite of all the testosterone, is because they have a genetic condition called male-pattern baldness. \n\nHair loss is a problem that affects most men and women.", "\n\nHuman: the mechanism allowing or causing flowers to track the sun as it moves across the sky.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I have not found the mechanism that allows flowers to track the sun as it moves across the sky.", "\n\nHuman: why does so many people hate the Baby boomer generation?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: what do you mean by so many people?", "\n\nHuman: [deleted by user]\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry I did not understand.", "\n\nHuman: Why are many guys perfectly fine with having sex with a stranger if they're attractive, while few girls would?

Many of them were right, and so they are not shamed.  The shaming comes from those who were drafted and still didn't want to go, but did so anyway.  The shame comes from the fact that the government is forcing people to do something that they do not want to do.

The fact that it has no laws against transsexual people, and that it does not consider transsexual people as criminals, does not mean that it is a liberal country.\n\nIranian society has very conservative views towards homosexuality, which is not surprising given that the country is predominantly Muslim and that Islam is strongly opposed to homosexuality.\n\nIranian society is also", "\n\nHuman: Why is depression a side effect of so many prescription drugs?\n\nIs it a certain ingredient in the medicine? Or combination of ingredients? Or is it maybe a psychological effect of routine medicine taking? \n\nAssistant: I think it is a combination of psychological effect of routine medicine taking and the ingredients.\n\nI think doctors have a psychological effect on the patients when they prescribe medicine.

Is it the reflection of the sky? What lives in it?\n\nAssistant: - The surface water of a body of water is blue due to the scattering of light by the water molecules. However, the color of the water can be due to the refraction of light by the suspended particles in the water, as well as by the atmosphere surrounding the body of water. \n\nThe reflection of the sky and the sun is a major contributor to the color of the surface water, which is why the ocean is blue during the day, and green at night. The color of the water is also affected by the presence of dissolved particles and organisms in the water. \n\nWater", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't the NES zapper for Duck hunt work on new TVs?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The NES zapper for Duck hunt works on all televisions", "\n\nHuman: What's the difference between 32 and 64bit computer systems, and why aren't there, say 128bit systems.\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: 32bit systems have a 32 bit integer size, 64 bit systems have a 64 bit integer size.

However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: Well, there are some reasons. First, most people who have higher educations have a more open mind. This is because they are not limited by their own experiences. They have learned how to think critically and rationally. This is a great skill for a liberal. Second, people with higher educations tend to be more concerned about the welfare of others. They want to help people and change the world. This is also a great skill for a liberal. Third, people with higher educations tend to be less religious. They are less likely to base their opinions on religious dogma.

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: It's all down to the frequency of the sound. For example, a human voice has many frequencies, so it's hard to reproduce that in a synthesizer. But if a synthesizer is able to reproduce a frequency, then it would sound the same as a human voice.\n\nHowever, it's easier to produce a synthesizer that can produce a lot of frequencies, because that's what most people would like to hear. But when you're able to make a synthesizer that can reproduce a specific frequency, then you can reproduce a human voice.\n\nIt's also easier", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Clouds are made of air. Air is made of molecules. Molecules are made of atoms. Atoms are made of electrons, protons, and neutrons. All the atoms are flying around and colliding with each other, but are held together by gravity. Gravity is caused by the mass of the Earth. The mass of the Earth is 5.97 x 10^24 kg.

We are raised to look at animals as friends, not enemies. This is why we don't see dogs or cats as dangerous, because they have become our friends and companions. This is why children are taught to not be afraid of animals, because we want them to be able to understand that animals are not scary.", "\n\nHuman: Why is power over ethernet possible?\n\n\n\nAssistant: 1) Power over ethernet is a way of delivering electrical power and data over the same network cable. Power over ethernet allows network devices to be powered from the same cable that is used to connect the devices to the network. Power over ethernet is typically implemented by adding a pair of conductors to the network cable. These conductors are typically referred to as \"Category 5e\" or \"Category 6\" cables. When the power and data are separated by a distance, the power over ethernet signals are usually amplified using a balanced signal. The power over ethern", "\n\nHuman: Why can we, unlike most of other animals, see colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are two main theories.

In addition, these countries are often plagued by civil wars, insurgencies, and terrorism. 3rd world countries also face the problem of being underdeveloped due to their location in terms of climate.

Drinking more than you lose means you\u2019re taking in more liquid than you\u2019re losing through your breath, sweat, urine, and other bodily functions. The most common way to dehydrate is through sweating, which is why exercise can make you dehydrated. Another way to dehydrate is by losing too much fluid through your urine. The reason this happens is because the kidneys can\u2019t regulate the amount of water that is lost through urine.", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: The word Hispanic refers to a group of people who are descended from the Spanish speaking countries.

Personally I'm interested in instead of full nation vs full nation how to subpopulations compare to each other? i.e. poor Americans vs poor Chinese, rich americans vs rich Chinese. Anyone familiar with this area?\n\nAssistant: Hi! I've been working on this area for a while. The U.S. definitely has a lot of issues with its education system, but I think it's important to remember that most countries have similar issues. There's a lot of talk about \"fixing\" education in the U.S., but it's not quite as simple as that.\n\nI think one of the biggest issues is that there's a lot of variation in education, both in terms of quality and accessibility.

Each event in the future is described by a series of variables, such as the location, time, temperature, etc. of that event. The values of these variables are determined by the laws of physics, and the initial conditions of the universe. The values of these variables may be different for each future event, so each event is in some sense unique. It is therefore impossible to predict the future perfectly.\n\nHowever, there is a lot of information about the future, and it is this information that makes predictions possible.
