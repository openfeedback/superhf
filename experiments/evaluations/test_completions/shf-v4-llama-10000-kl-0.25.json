The only one I can think of off the top of my head is the Ice Man. \n\nSo, archaeologist and anthropologist of Reddit, why are so many ancient and prehistoric human remains from children?  \n\nAssistant: A good question. I can only guess that children are easier to preserve than adults, because they are smaller, and because they are younger, their bones are still growing, so they are less likely to break or fracture during burial, and so they are less likely to be damaged by burial or post-burial processes. Also, children are likely to be more of a priority for burial, so they might be buried more carefully and in a more special place.", "\n\nHuman: Why certain species as humans and lions have so much physical differences between males and females ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I think you're asking why do humans and lions have different physical characteristics?", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.
