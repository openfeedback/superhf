But why China has not done so, I think it is because of the influence of North Korea and South Korea. China will not want to go against North Korea if it's in the same political system, and it will not want to go against South Korea if it's in the same political system.

Sugar has a negative effect on your health, because it converts to glucose quickly. When your body converts sugar to glucose, it releases insulin, which is a hormone. The insulin causes your body to store fat. When you eat too much sugar, your body stores fat and that is not good.", "\n\nHuman: \"Your download starts in 5 seconds.

Just wondering how exactly does this happen? I've heard some misc. paper items being found, pictures, documents, etc. and also more heavy objects like rings being found.\n\nDoes it just take forever to float down? Understandable for paper items, I guess, but rings? I can't imagine a tornado is so powerful to be able to throw an object that far. Maybe the wind carries it? I'm unsure.\n\nAssistant: The tornado is so powerful that it can pick up an entire house and throw it around and it can also pick up a tree and toss it around.\n\nTornadoes can be very strong and destructive. It is not so much about how strong a tornado is as it is the speed and direction of the wind. When a tornado is very strong it can be moving faster than the speed of sound. That is the wind speed of 761 miles per hour. When the wind is moving faster than the speed of sound it cannot be heard.

If you want to know how long it takes for you to travel a certain distance, you need to measure the distance in light-years, which is the distance light travels in a year. One light-year is 6.3 trillion miles, or 9.9 trillion kilometers. This is how far light travels in a year.

Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: It's a good question. The liver is the main organ in the digestive system for fat metabolism. It converts fat from food into a water-soluble compound called \"bile\" which is then stored in the gallbladder, and when needed, released into the small intestine.\n\nSaliva contains an enzyme called \"lipase\" which is needed to digest fats.

Is it a matter of artistic expression?  Also, is there some threshold at which the average person can remain engaged through a song vs the same for a movie?\n\nAssistant: It's a cultural norm, and it's also due to the fact that people have different attention spans.  The average person can stay engaged for 3-5 minutes, and that's about the same amount of time it takes to tell a good story.  Three to five minutes is also a standard length for most songs.  That's just a general rule.  If a song is longer than five minutes, people tend to lose interest.  Also, if a song is too short, people tend to get bored, because they want to hear more.

The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the retina to the brain. When the eyes are rubbed, pressure is applied to the optic nerve. This pressure can cause a temporary interruption of the nerve signals to the brain. When the eyes are not rubbed, the pressure on the optic nerve is relieved, and the nerve signals resume normally.", "\n\nHuman: Why carbohydrates are at the bottom of the pyramid and sugar at the top, when they're basically the same thing (glucose)?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hi, there are three main reasons why you see carbohydrates at the bottom of the pyramid, and sugars at the top.", "\n\nHuman: Why are human eye colours restricted to brown, blue, green, and in extremely rare cases, red, as opposed to other colours?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure.

I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: Well, the frequency of sound waves is a measure of the number of vibrations per second. So the faster the sound wave, the higher the frequency and the more vibrations per second, the higher the amplitude of the sound wave. The amplitude of a sound wave is a measure of the intensity of the sound wave. So, the higher the amplitude of a sound wave, the more intense the sound wave. So, if you have a sound wave with a high amplitude, then you can expect a high intensity of vibrations in the air. The vibrations in the air will move molecules, and the mole", "\n\nHuman: Why are some medications in higher doses only with a prescription?\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: Some medications are only available with a prescription for safety reasons.", "\n\nHuman: What volume of water is required to drown a human?\n\nAnd a second, slightly sillier question, can someone drown swallowing only a mouthful of water?\n\nAssistant: How do we drown a human?", "\n\nHuman: If so many people hate cable companies, why don't more people switch to DirecTv?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because DirecTv is not available in their area.", "\n\nHuman: How does the US Air Force determine which aircraft(B-1,B-2,B-52,F-16,etc) a target needs to be bombed by?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I did not quite get your question.

Why?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a great question! I think the answer is that the water molecules are\n\nmore likely to form a lattice structure when they're cold, and it's easier for them to\n\nfreeze.

I'm gonna leave it as biology for now, tell me if this doesn't belong here.\n\nAssistant: I think it's more of a cultural thing.

What does this charge mean exactly and how does the legal process work? \n\nAssistant: This is a very broad question and the answer depends on how the charges are brought. There are a variety of ways that charges can be brought and all of them are unique to the country and the situation. For example, if the UN is bringing charges, it would be brought before the International Criminal Court. If the US is bringing charges, it would be before the US federal court. If a foreign government is bringing charges, it would be before the courts of the foreign country.", "\n\nHuman: What is Medicaid and HMOs and how do they relate?

So as a recent graduate [23F], I feel ashamed that I haven't informed myself about health insurance, or healthcare in general. I took my insurance for granted as a student.

Is there a way to know for certain if it will leave a scar or not?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The factors that determine if a wound will leave a scar or not are the size of the wound, the type of wound (e.g. a deep laceration, a shallow abrasion), the depth of the wound (how far into the skin does the wound penetrate) and the healing time. If a wound is small, penetrates only superficially into the skin, and heals in a relatively short period of time, then there is a low probability that it will leave a scar. If the wound is larger, penetrates deeply into the skin", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing.

So I think I should just see the back seat in my car, but voila! There is a dimmer picture there all the sudden.

At the focal point, the light rays converge and thus produce a magnified image of the image. This magnified image is projected in a direction perpendicular to the mirror. This is why the mirror does not just make the back seat appear further down, but rather it appears to be closer.", "\n\nHuman: Why did we evolve our tails away?\n\nAs an outdoorsman, I feel like it would be so beneficial.

This is why they are considered over the counter, because they do not require a prescription.\n\nMorphine is a powerful drug that is used for extreme pain.

The frequency of the magnetic field is in the range of 50 Hz to 60 Hz, which is below the threshold of human perception.", "\n\nHuman: ; The lines with red bumps and blue triangles on the weather forecast.

Why is it that the reverse does not happen. When browsing on my laptop and I click on a _URL_0_ link it just opens the mobile version.\n\nAssistant: I'm not really sure what you're asking.", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Do you have any other points you'd like to make?", "\n\nHuman: What is \"The Cloud\"?

Can't they just stop choking themselves when it gets sketchy? And once they pass out, doesn't the body automatically breathe for them/if applicable their partner would stop choking them?\n\nAssistant: People often don't realize they're actually choking themselves, or they don't realize how easy it is to pass out.  Some people also have a condition called vascular dementia, in which the brain gets starved of oxygen and cannot send the appropriate signals to stop choking.", "\n\nHuman: What makes Scientology stand out as that one \"crazy\" religion?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We're not a religion.

Let me look into that.", "\n\nHuman: What's the purpose of the mysterious slash at the end of URLs?\n\nExample 1: type \"reddit\" in Google. Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: It's just the way the browser handles URLs.", "\n\nHuman: How come yellow highlighter doesn't show up on paper when you photocopy it?\n\nMy mom showed me this when we worked at a hotel together. They would keep a master copy of papers that needed to be copied frequently. These master copies would say \"MASTER COPY\" across the paper in yellow highlighter. When you photocopied it, the highlighter didn't show up. Why?? \n\nAssistant: It's because the highlighter is invisible to the photocopier.", "\n\nHuman: what's the difference between a chief of police and a sheriff?\n\n\n\nAssistant: a chief of police is a sheriff with an assistant.", "\n\nHuman: Why is 'dozen' used instead of 12?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: [removed]", "\n\nHuman: How is a single speaker capable of accurately reproducing various channels and frequencies simultaneously?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: How do automotive keyless entry systems work? I don't mean when you have to press the button on the fob, I mean the passive systems where you keep the fob in your pocket and just pull the door handle to unlock.\n\nI'm not sure if it's best in ELI5 or in askscience or something, but I'm curious exactly how they work.  I know it's something to do with the car emitting LF signals which the fob responds to and then emits an unlock code, or am I way off?  An explanation of the actual signal / workflow would be greatly appreciated since I'm curious how mine reacts so quickly, and how my girlfriend's car must obviously be using higher-powered antennae since the interior lights come on when she walks up to it.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: I think I found this: http://www.carkeys.co.uk/how-keyless-entry-systems-work/", "\n\nHuman: Why is every (2012 POTUS campaign) fundraising deadline \"the biggest fundraising deadline we've faced yet\"?\n\nI get a lot of email, every day, from various political action groups... The DCCC, PFAW, etc; and the Obama campaign as well. They're all guilty of this.\n\nAside from the fact that some (stupid) people might actually feel some urgency to donate (more, or at all) solely based on that line... What does it actually mean? Is it based on truth at all?

Maybe I'm just being dumb but I was thinking if every action has an equal and opposite reaction then what is receiving the opposite energy needed to move the shuttle? I guess I'm thinking even if the engines are burning the fuel its not like the ship is pushing on anything how can the shuttle move?  What am I missing? Motion conserves momentum right? But fundamentally what are the thrusters pushing against to move the shuttle?\n\nAssistant: ELIA5: Hi, I'm glad to see you're asking this question.\n\nIf we were to put a spacecraft in a rocket ship, say a rocket ship that is 100 meters long and 100 meters high, we'll just say that the rocket ship has a length of 100 meters.\n\nThe spacecraft is going to move in a straight line.
