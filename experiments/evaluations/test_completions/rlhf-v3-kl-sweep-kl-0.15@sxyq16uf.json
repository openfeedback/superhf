Lasers also typically have a much narro", "\n\nHuman: Why do headphones sometimes sound better after being used a bit?\n\nBefore I bought my current headphones, I found that reviewers would say that certain headphones did or did not require a \"burning-in\" time or something like that. Why is that, and why do some need it and some others don't?\n\nAssistant: The \"burning-in\" process is a process where audio components are broken in or \"broken in\" by playing them for an extended period of time, usually hundreds of hours. This helps reduce the amount of sound distortion and increases the sound quality of the headphones. The process can also help the headphones last longer as the parts are broken in and lessen the strain on the components.", "\n\nHuman: What social factors caused Austin, a liberal hipster enclave, to develop in the middle of a highly conservative state?\n\nIt's something I've thought about fairly often lately.

I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: No, defaulting on debt would not drive the price of gold up to ridiculously high levels. Gold is an asset that is highly sensitive to changes in the US dollar, so when the US dollar weakens, gold tends to increase in value. However, defaulting on debt would likely cause a decrease in the value of the US dollar, so it would not drive the price of gold up.\n\nYes, you should consider other risk-free rates when valuating companies.

Aluminum also forms a much thinner oxide layer than steel, which means that the oxidation process is less visible. Additionally, the aluminum oxide layer is much harder than the oxide layer formed on steel, so it is better able to protect the aluminum from further oxidation.", "\n\nHuman: Why is is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The reason why it is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light is because the bright light causes the pupils to dilate, which allows the mucus to pass through the nasal passages more easily.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is a memory, on an atomic level?\n\nIn order to retrieve a memory, the neurons have to access it somehow.

Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: The slash is part of the domain, so it is not necessary to be included in the address when hovering over the link.", "\n\nHuman: Why does the US have to be close allies with Saudi Arabia?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.", "\n\nHuman: How is Hacking possible.\n\nThis is a really hard concept for me so please bear with me. I don't quite understand how it is even possible for someone to enter into a private or secure server or computer and bring about changes. The only way I see it working is if you some how let the virus into the system.\n\nAssistant: Hacking is possible by exploiting vulnerabilities in the system. For example, if there is a known bug in the system that allows access to the server or computer without authentication, a hacker can use this to gain access. Additionally, hackers may use phishing or brute force attacks to gain access to a system.", "\n\nHuman: why do things like metal and lava turn red when they are are hot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: why pillows, blankets, etc have those tags that are \"penalized by law\" if removed by anyone but the consumer\n\n\n\nAssistant: ", "\n\nHuman: Why is there a statute of limitations?\n\nIt seems like it only really protects criminals (i.e. Bill Cosby), so why do we have it?\n\nAssistant: The statute of limitations is a law that sets a time limit on the amount of time that can pass after a crime is committed before prosecutors must file charges or the accused must face a legal defense. It is meant to protect both victims and accused individuals by providing a clear timeline for prosecutors to bring charges and for the accused to prepare their defense. It also prevents evidence from becoming stale and allows for justice to be served in a timely manner.", "\n\nHuman: How do people accidentally die from auto-erotic asphyxiation?\n\nIf the human brain can survive for upwards of 3 minutes (no training) without oxygen, how do so many people accidentally kill themselves while asphyxiating themselves/having their partner asphyxiate them during sex/masturbation? Can't they just stop choking themselves when it gets sketchy? And once they pass out, doesn't the body automatically breathe for them/if applicable their partner would stop choking them?\n\nAssistant: The human brain can survive for up to 15-20 minutes without oxygen, but death usually occurs after 3-5 minutes due to brain damage. People who accidentally die from auto-erotic asphyxiation usually do so because they don't realize how quickly the situation can become dangerous or how much time has passed. They may also be in a state of heightened arousal and thus fail to notice the warning signs or become too focused on the sensations and don't realize how far they are pushing things.
