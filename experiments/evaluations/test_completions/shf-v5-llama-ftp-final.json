Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with certainty.  This is the case because the more accurately we know the position of the particle, the less accurately we know its momentum, and vice versa.  In other words, the more certain we are about one, the more uncertain we become about the other.  This uncertainty can only be reduced by making the measurements with less accuracy.  For example, if you make a measurement with a certain accuracy, you are forced to make a second measurement with an uncertainty that is greater than the original", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis?

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer.

The bile is then absorbed into the bloodstream and then the liver will re-absorb it and make more.\n\nThe liver also breaks down fats into smaller molecules, but this process requires bile. Bile is a liquid that is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder.
