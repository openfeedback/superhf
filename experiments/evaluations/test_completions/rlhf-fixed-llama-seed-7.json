Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Well, \n\n  x and p are related by the equation p=mv, where v is the velocity.\n\nSo if we know the mass, then we can know the velocity and momentum.\n\nBut if we know the velocity, then we can't know the momentum.\n\n\nThis is what I'm confused about. I know that momentum is related to velocity by momentum = mv, where m is the mass and v is the velocity. But if we know the mass, then we can know the velocity, and thus know the momentum.

They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: AMD has been a little behind Intel in terms of CPU performance, but that gap is closing.\n\nAMD's Opteron line of CPUs have historically been targeted at servers and high-end workstations, and Intel's Core line has been targeted at consumers and mainstream desktops and laptops.

What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Sometimes, you might need to know the number of significant digits in a number.
