Viscosity is determined by the molecular structure of the liquid and the force of the intermolecular forces between the molecules. The greater the molecular weight of a liquid, the greater its viscosity. Viscosity is also influenced by temperature. As temperature increases, the molecules in the liquid become more mobile, and the liquid flows more freely.", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing.
