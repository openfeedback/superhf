Then you will have $r=1/2+h$ for some real number $h$.  You will have $h=2^{-n}$ for some integer $n$, so $r=1/2+2^{-n}$.  But $1/2+2^{-n}=1/2$ and so $h=0$.

Parallel processing is used when the work to be done is very large, but the computer does not have the power to do the work in a reasonable amount of time.  By splitting the work up, the computer can then do the work in less time.
