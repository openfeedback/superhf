Nosebleeds can also be caused by allergies, infection, or the use of certain medications.", "\n\nHuman: Americans and Credit Card Debt\n\nAs an European I don't really understand why so many Americans have such high credit card debt. What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: Well, credit card debt is a common way for Americans to access quick, convenient, and often necessary funding for a variety of expenses, such as emergency medical bills, home repairs, and everyday expenses. Many Americans also use credit cards to build credit history and access rewards, which can help them to save money in the long run. Additionally, some people may not have the ability or access to other forms of financing, such as a savings account or a loan, to cover their needs.", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: Because aluminum oxidation is a chemical process, not a rusting process like steel. Aluminum oxide is a different compound than iron oxide, so they cannot be compared. The process of aluminum oxidation is called 'oxidation' while the process of steel oxidation is called 'rusting'.", "\n\nHuman: Why is is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I did not understand the question.

I wonder how the memory of what you had for breakfast is different on am atomic level than the memory of your first kiss.\n\nAssistant: We don't know exactly. It is believed that memories are encoded in the neural pathways and synapses in the brain. When a memory is recalled, the neural pathways and synapses fire in the same way they did when the memory was originally encoded. This causes the memory to be retrieved. The exact mechanism is still not fully understood.", "\n\nHuman: How does an ice cream machine dispense ice cream?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It uses a pump to circulate cold liquid from an external ice cream mix through a tube, which freezes as it passes through the chillers. The ice cream then passes through a freezer, where it is frozen further and then hardened. Finally, it is sent out to the dispenser where it is scooped and served.", "\n\nHuman: Why do babies cry as soon as they\u2019re born, and why is it a bad sign if they don\u2019t?\n\nThe answer seems like it should be obvious, but is there something else going on that makes this such an important component of its well being?\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \u201cbad sign\u201d?", "\n\nHuman: Is the US Police really becoming an arbitrary tool or is it just the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts?\n\nGerman student here. I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\".

The cars also have different engines, weight, tires, and other factors that affect their performance.", "\n\nHuman: Sensitive Skin - Why does it seem like people with pale skin are more prone to acne?\n\nWhy do gingers seem to get more zits than say swarthy italian people?  \n\nAssistant: Because people with fair skin have thinner skin and are more prone to inflammation, which can lead to breakouts. Additionally, fair-skinned people tend to have a higher concentration of sebaceous glands, which can increase the likelihood of acne.  Additionally, some medications and cosmetics can cause skin sensitivity and can lead to breakouts.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between a viscous liquid and a pasty liquid?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we groan and make deep noises when lifting weights and in pain?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We don't know.

Why do we gag when we put our finger in our throat?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: The human body has a natural reflex called the gag reflex which is involuntary and protects the airway from foreign objects. When something is put in the throat that is too large or too hard to swallow, the body will automatically gag to protect the airway.", "\n\nHuman: What is happening when our nipples get hard?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When our nipples get hard, it is a physical response to cold, pressure, or stimulation.

Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: The rain appears to be stationary because from a distance, it is difficult to distinguish individual raindrops from the entire cloud. It appears as if the entire cloud is moving towards the ground, when in reality the droplets of water are falling individually.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers!

The forward-bending knee joints of humans and other bipeds provide a more efficient walking pattern, since the knee joint can be flexed and extended repeatedly with each stride. This allows the legs to remain under the body, providing a more efficient transfer of power from the lower legs to the center of gravity. The backward-bending knee joints of dogs and cats, on the other hand, are better su", "\n\nHuman: why I can buy brand new record players in stores, but not needles?\n\nAre there not enough companies manufacturing them?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

Wouldn\u2019t video be more valuable for the NTSB in case something bad happens?\n\n\n\nAssistant: That's a good question. We'll forward it to the relevant department for further investigation. In the meantime, here's some additional information that might help answer your question.\n\nAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), recording audio during a flight is required by law, while video recording is not. The FAA regulations state that \u201cthe operation of an audio or video recording device on board an aircraft, or the possession of such a device, is prohibited except as provided in this part.\u201d The regulations further specify that recording devices may be used for \u201crecreational purposes\u201d but not", "\n\nHuman: Radioactivity.

Banks gradually replaced paper money with electronic money, which allowed for faster and more secure transactions. This transition was further accelerated by the introduction of the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network in the 1970s, which allowed banks to transfer funds between accounts electronically. Today, most money is stored in digital form and is electronically transferred between accounts.", "\n\nHuman: Why are there diseases/viruses/etc that harm the human body, but never anything that enhances or improves us?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

How come you can't reseal?\n\nAssistant: We are not sure, but we believe it has something to do with the body's need to keep the amount of fluid balanced. Breaking the seal might cause the body to release more urine in order to re-establish the seal, leading to more frequent urination. We are not sure why the body cannot reseal the urethra, but it might have something to do with the amount of urine left in the bladder.", "\n\nHuman: Why so we have Fetishes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We have Fetishes because they help us to stimulate our bodies and minds in order to increase our pleasure and enjoyment of life.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it.

Conversely, a lower aperture number (higher f-number) corresponds to a smaller lens opening, which limits the amount of light that passes through, resulting in a greater depth of field.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: The legal guardians of the child are responsible for making sure that the work does not interf,ere with their education or health, and that the working conditions are safe and appropriate for the child's age.

I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: Can you provide some more information? What kind of sound wave? What frequency? How will you know when you've hit the right frequency? What kind of chemical solution?

Reddit will obviously be the first result, and you will see the address indicated as _URL_0_. Why \"/\"?\n\nExample 2: go to the Reddit's homepage, _URL_1_ (notice there is no slash). Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included. Since the slash is part of the domain, why does it not show there?\n\nAssistant: It appears that the slash at the end of a URL is used for several different purposes. For example, in the first example, the slash indicates that the website is a subdomain of another website (e.g. reddit.com/r/subreddit). In the second example, the slash is part of the domain and is necessary for the website to function correctly. In the third example, the slash is added by the browser to indicate that the page is a new page, rather than a page within the same domain. Finally, in the fourth example, the slash is not included because it is not necessary for the", "\n\nHuman: Why does the US have to be close allies with Saudi Arabia?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I can't answer that question as it goes beyond the scope of the model.", "\n\nHuman: How is Hacking possible.\n\nThis is a really hard concept for me so please bear with me.

It is meant to provide fairness to both parties by preventing an individual from waiting too long to file a lawsuit and allowing the accused to defend themselves in a timely manner.

It is characterized by itchy, scaling, and flaking skin between the toes. It can be very painful and uncomfortable. The fungus thrives in warm, moist environments, so wearing socks and shoes that are too tight, wet, or made of materials that don't allow feet to breathe can contribute to the condition."]}
