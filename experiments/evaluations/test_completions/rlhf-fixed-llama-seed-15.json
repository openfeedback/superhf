Why?\n\nAssistant: The Chinese Restaurant effect is a cognitive bias that describes a phenomenon in which people expect a Chinese restaurant to serve food that is better than that served by a typical American restaurant.  This bias has been demonstrated in a number of studies.\n\nThe effect is the opposite of the halo effect, in which people expect better performance or traits from a person or group simply because they are associated with a desirable trait.  In the case of the Chinese restaurant effect, people expect that a Chinese restaurant serves better food simply because the restaurant is Chinese.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: It is a phenomenon known as \\strong{salt water retention}.\n\nSalt causes the cells of a plant to swell up, and so it \\strong{retains} water. The \\strong{retention} is due to the fact that the cells of the plant are \\strong{swelling}. This is due to the fact that the cell walls \\strong{lose} their turgor, which is the \\strong{elastic} quality of the cell walls. This causes the cell to become \\strong{deflated}.

As soon as you take your hands out of the water, the water molecules are free to move, and they move away from each other. This is called evaporation. The water molecules move away from each other to form a gas. This is why the surface of the water gets wet when you take your hands out of the water.
