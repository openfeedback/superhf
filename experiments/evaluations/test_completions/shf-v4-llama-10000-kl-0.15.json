Hibernation is also used by animals that are not cold-blooded, such as some types of bats and ground squirrel", "\n\nHuman: Why is understanding a language easier than speaking it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Thank you for contacting Microsoft Customer Care.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: The water is released because of the process of osmosis. Osmosis is the process by which a solvent, such as water, moves through a selectively permeable membrane from a region of high solute concentration to a region of low solute concentration, until the concentrations of the solvent and solute are equalized on both sides of the membrane.
