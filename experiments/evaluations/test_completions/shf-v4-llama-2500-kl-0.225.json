How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: The way time is experienced is a function of the relative speed of the observer and the object being observed.\n\nThe speed of light is the universal speed limit, so if something is moving faster than the speed of light relative to you, then it is moving faster than you are moving.  The speed of light is 300,000,000 meters per second.\n\nIf you were moving in a spaceship at 90% of the speed of light, then you would be moving at 270,000,000 meters per second relative to something that is station", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It was a standard that was developed by scientists and mathematicians.
