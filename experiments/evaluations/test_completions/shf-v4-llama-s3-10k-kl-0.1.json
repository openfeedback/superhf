Does it make grammatical sense?\n\nWhenever I see \"one another\", I always read it in my mind as \"one **and** other\", because from my multilingual point of view that seems to make more grammatical sense.

It is used to replace the noun \"way\", which is the intended meaning of \"one another way\".
