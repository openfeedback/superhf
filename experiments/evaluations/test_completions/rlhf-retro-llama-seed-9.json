Lots to think about. :-)\n\nAssistant: I think it has to do with the way we are taught as children.  Children are taught in Europe to be more open-minded and not to judge people based on their appearance or beliefs.  In America, we are taught to be more individualistic and to believe in ourselves and our abilities.  This makes us less open-minded and more likely to judge people based on their appearance or beliefs.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Well, I don't know why we get an urge to rub our eyes when tired.

They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: 1. 6 cores = 12 threads\n 2. 8 cores = 16 threads\n 3. 6 cores = 12 threads = 12/2 = 6 threads per core\n 4. 8 cores = 16 threads = 16/2 = 8 threads per core\n 5. 6 cores = 12 threads = 12/2 = 6 threads per core\n 6. 8 cores = 16 threads = 16/2 = 8 threads per core\n 7. 12", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The eyes are the most expressive part of our face, so when we haven't slept well, our eyes are more likely to move around.", "\n\nHuman: In movies and books, people with terminal end-stage cancers are almost always symptom free until they drop dead one day.

When these compounds reach our olfactory receptors, they bind to proteins called receptors, which in turn activate signaling molecules that are sent to the brain. The olfactory receptor has a specific shape that fits snugly into the receptor binding site of a particular smell molecule.", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Yes, in fact a traveler would be 20 years younger when he returned to Earth.  It's not that the way you experience time changes, but rather that your time on the ship has been measured by a different \"clock.\"  The clocks on the ship are set by the ship's motion, which means they are accelerating.  When you return to Earth, you will notice that your clock and the Earth clock are not exactly synchronized.  The traveler will be younger than the years he spent on the ship.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nSure!  You've got to understand that in a coin flip, the probability of the result occurring is 50% for every flip.  So, if you flip a coin 100 times and it comes up heads 100 times, then the probability that the next flip will come up heads is 100% (100%).

If so how do they recover so quickly and how is it different from sleep?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Yes, they do stay in the same position the entirety of winter. And they recover quickly, because the blood stops circulating, which is why they lose a lot of weight, and also their heart rate drops. So they don't have to circulate as much blood, and therefore they don't use up as much energy. The difference between hibernation and sleep is that in sleep, you're still conscious, you're still aware of what's happening around you, you're just not awake enough to react to it.
