Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that it is impossible to simultaneously know the exact momentum and position of a particle.\n\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics. It states that for any physical system there is a minimum uncertainty in the position and momentum of a particle. This means that, on average, you can only know the position of a particle with a certain degree of uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the momentum of a particle is also limited. The uncertainty in the position of a particle is called the uncertainty in x, and the uncertainty in the momentum of a particle", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis? All the online explanations are too complicated for my tiny brain.\n\nIt seems it has something to do with the history of an object impacting the current/future performance of that object, but I\u2019d like to be able to better explain it to others.\n\nAssistant: A hysteresis is a property of a system that depends on the past behaviour of the system. The word originates from the Greek word hysteresis. It was first used by the British physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1861 to describe the effect of a magnet on an electromagnet. In a magnet, the magnetization can be measured, for example, by the magnetic field that it generates. If the magnet is heated, the magnetization will change: the magnet will become demagnetized and will lose its magnetization.

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: The AMD 8-core CPU has a lower clock speed.  However, this doesn't mean it's slower, because the number of cores is higher.  The number of cores is important, because this determines how many things can be done simultaneously.  For example, if you have a CPU with 2 cores, then it can only do 2 things at once.  However, if you have 8 cores, then it can do 8 things at once.  This is important for applications that need to do a lot of calculations in parallel.  For example, if you are doing machine learning", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is called sleep myoclonus and is a normal part of sleep.

However, American talk shows air five days a week - Kimmel, Fallon..ect\n\nAssistant: The short answer is that American talk shows air five days a week because the majority of their audience is in the United States.\n\nThe long answer is that there are two main reasons why American talk shows air five days a week. The first is that the majority of their audience is in the United States. If a talk show only aired once a week, people in the United States would miss out on a large portion of the show. This is particularly true in the case of late-night talk shows, which typically air in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nThe second reason is that American talk shows are not only", "\n\nHuman: Origin of \"In Mother Russia...\" jokes\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: [removed]", "\n\nHuman: Colloidal silver?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Colloidal silver is a\n\nA. mixture of silver particles in solution\n\nB. mixture of silver particles in a gel\n\nC. mixture of silver particles in a gel that has been heated\n\nD. mixture of silver particles in a gel that has been heated and then cooled\n\nE. mixture of silver particles in a gel that has been heated, cooled and then heated again\n\nF. mixture of silver particles in a gel that has been heated, cooled and then heated again and then cooled again\n\nG. mixture of silver particles", "\n\nHuman: Why do you \"drive\" a car, but \"pilot\" a boat, plane, etc.?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A car is driven using an engine to create torque on the wheels, which is then used to turn the wheels and propel the car forward.

There is a general rule that the most popular posts on Reddit are the ones that are the most recent or the ones that are the most relevant to the current events. However, this rule does not apply to all of the posts. The posts that have the largest number of votes are the ones that are the most entertaining, controversial, or funny. There are several factors that determine whether or not a post will be popular on Reddit. These factors include the headline of the post, the quality of the content, the", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a piece of the hardest material tried to break through another piece?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A piece of the hardest material could not break through another piece.

THC is the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana that is responsible for the high. Anandamide is not a psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, so it will not cause a person to fail a drug test for THC.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Liquids can be broadly classified into two groups - \n\n- 1. Fluids that have very high viscosity - \n- 2. Liquids that have very low viscosity - \n\nThe transition between these two states is called the critical point. At the critical point, the liquid has zero viscosity and the fluid becomes a gas.\n\nThe critical point of a fluid occurs at a temperature and pressure where the liquid is in equilibrium with the vapor phase. The critical temperature and pressure are the same for all substances. The critical temperature is 37", "\n\nHuman: Why did Le Chiffre try to bomb the Skyfleet airliner in the movie \"Casino Royale\"?\n\nI decided to enjoy an ol' (2006) favourite tonight, but I still don't understand how Le Chiffre was to gain if the Skyfleet stock dropped after the attempted bombing.

The movement of the mouse pointer is typically achieved\n\nthrough an application programming interface (API) that is", "\n\nHuman: When there\u2019s a mirror scene in a movie or television show, how do they get the shot without showing the camera in the mirror, especially with a head on face shot?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A \"mirror\" shot is where the camera is positioned in a way that it appears that the camera is a reflection in the mirror. This is achieved by using a camera that is much smaller than the lens being used, and a set of mirrors that are placed around the camera. Since the camera is smaller, it can be placed inside the mirror. The camera is then pointed at the actor so that the camera can see the reflection in the mirror. This can be achieved with the use of a mirror, or by using a set of mirrors to create a large mirror that the camera can be placed inside. The mirror", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The practice of circumcision is still common in the United States because it is a cultural practice.

Why?\n\nAssistant: I am not a cook, but I have tried making some dishes I've eaten at restaurants. I have found that the dishes that taste best are the ones that have a lot of ingredients, and are very seasoned with spices. I'm not sure what your experience is with Chinese food, but I think you are probably right that the restaurant dishes are better because they have the right seasoning and spices. I'm also not sure that all Chinese restaurants are the same, so I think the taste may vary from restaurant to restaurant.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we squint when we try to look far away?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When we try to look far away, the images in our eyes are blurry. This is because our eyes are designed to focus on objects near us, but when we try to see objects far away, our eyes don't know what to do. In this case, our eyes try to focus on the image, but because the image is far away, the image is blurry. This blurry image is known as an image out of focus. The brain interprets this blurry image as an object that is far away. The brain then says to the eyes, \"Focus on this blurry image\"", "\n\nHuman: How is carbonated water made?\n\n\n\nAssistant: To make carbonated water, you start with plain water and then add a little bit of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is dissolved in water. This is called a carbonated water. This carbonated water has a carbonation level of 2.5% to 3% carbon dioxide. If you want to make carbonated water with a higher carbonation level, you need to add more carbon dioxide. In this case, the carbonated water has a carbonation level of 5% to 7%. To make carbonated water with a lower carbonation level, you need to use", "\n\nHuman: Why do Americans spell their words differently to British English  i.e Colour - Color and why don't they pronounce the H in herb.\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the 17th and 18th centuries, when the United States was a British colony, the spelling of words was regulated by the British government. As a result, American spellings of words were often different from the British spelling, and the spelling differences sometimes reflected pronunciation differences between British English and American English. For example, the word \"colour\" is spelled with a U in British English, but a UR in American English. British English uses the spelling \"herb,\" whereas American English uses the spelling \"herb\" (except when the word is part of", "\n\nHuman: why does the temperature of the shower water change so much with a tiny push?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The temperature of the shower water changes so much with a tiny push because the water heater is not the only thing that determines the temperature of the water. The size of the water pipes and the length of the shower head also contribute to the temperature of the water. If the water heater is too small, it will not have enough hot water to meet the demand. If the water pipes are too small, the water will take longer to reach the shower head. If the shower head is too large, it will take too long to heat up the water. The water temperature will be different if you have", "\n\nHuman: ISIS situation June 2014 vs. June 2015\n\nISIS has been explained many times during the last year, but a lot has happened since June 2014.

What is the limit to the amount of weight they can pull?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The force required to pull a train is dependent on the mass of the train and the weight of the cars. The train must have a high enough force to pull the train at a constant speed. The maximum weight that a train can pull is determined by the tractive effort of the locomotive. For example, a 4-axle locomotive with a tractive effort of 120,000 lb (54 kN) can pull 48 cars at 20 mph (32 km/h).", "\n\nHuman: How are ancient scrolls, texts, tablets and hieroglyphics accurately translated into modern text without a modern reference?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Ancient text can be translated into modern text with a modern reference if the modern reference is in the same language as the ancient text. For example, a modern English text can be translated into modern English if the modern English text contains an English dictionary or thesaurus.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: The answer is actually pretty simple. It is the molecules that are responsible for the smell that are released. Since there are more molecules in water than in air, the smell is amplified.\n\nThe same goes for the other way around. When you heat up a substance, the molecules will start to move faster and faster until they reach a point of critical temperature. In that state, the molecules are no longer attached to each other and you are left with a gas. Since there are fewer molecules in gas than in liquid, the smell is reduced.\n\nIt's the same thing", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?  How will this help humankind?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The LHC is a large particle accelerator that is used to collide particles together at energies of 14 TeV. This is the highest energy collider in the world.  The LHC collides protons together to see what is made of them and how they interact.  The hope is that we can see new particles and new interactions that will allow us to understand how the universe works.  This will help us understand the fundamental interactions of the universe and how it works.  This will allow us to understand the nature of the universe better and allow us to better understand how the universe works.  This will", "\n\nHuman: could someone please explain to me the differences between right political parties and left political parties (ex. Fascism and Communism) ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fascism and Communism are two ideologies that are often used to describe political parties in right and left spectrum. While both ideologies have a few similarities, the main difference between them is the role of government in the society. Fascism is a form of government where the role of government is much more prominent and the society is organized based on the principles of nationalism. In a Fascist society, the role of government is to control the society and to create a strong national identity. In a Communist society, the role of government is much lesser and the society is organized based on the principles of socialism", "\n\nHuman: Why does the way you experience time change depending on your location in the universe?\n\nSo I remember reading something awhile back that basically stated that depending on where you are in the galaxy one year could be 20 earth years (or x number of years) and you would age accordingly. How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: There are multiple answers to your question:\n\n1. A year is a unit of time equal to 365.25 days.\n\n2. The distance from Earth to the Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million km).\n\n3. In the Earth-Sun system, it takes about 1 year for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun.\n\n4. The speed of Earth in its orbit around the Sun is about 66,600 miles per hour (107,000 km per hour).\n\n5.

There are several reasons why we can't confirm it, but the main one is that it's so far away that we have never actually seen it, but we have measured the gravitational effects that it has on other planets.  Because of this, we can infer that there is an object there.  We can also measure the orbit of other planets in the Solar System and calculate", "\n\nHuman: If cannibalism is bad for a species,what sense for newly-bedded black widows to eat their mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In the mating of many species, including black widow spiders, the male of the species dies soon after mating. This is called \"sibiolization\", and it is common in many species. The female of the species benefits from the death of the male in that she does not have to care for the male, and can use the resources that the male was using to care for himself. The female also benefits from the mating because she receives a larger quantity of sperm from the male than she would if she was mating with multiple males.\n\nTherefore, in the case of black widow", "\n\nHuman: if fruit is sweet to encourage animals to eat it and carry the seeds away from the parent tree, how do lemons and limes fit into this mix?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Fruit with a high level of acidity is not sweet. This includes citrus fruits. There is also a lack of sugar in citrus fruits. Citrus fruits also have a low amount of water. This prevents animals from carrying the seeds away from the parent tree. Fruits that are not sweet and have a high level of acidity are not attractive to animals.", "\n\nHuman: Product placement in movies\n\nHow much do they pay the movies relative to the movie's budget, how do they specify how subtle or obvious the placement is, and any other info!\n\nAssistant: Product placement in movies typically costs $50,000-$500,000. In general, the more expensive the movie, the more product placement the movie will have. Product placement in movies is usually paid for by the company or the brand that is being placed in the movie.

For example, species evolved in different ways due to the fact that lions evolved in a hot climate. This means that lions evolved to have a large body size and a thick coat of fur in order to keep them cool and to be able to withstand the hot climate. This means that females have a smaller body size and a thinner coat of fur compared to males. In humans, the opposite is true.", "\n\nHuman: EL15:  Is there a limit to the amount of information that can be sent through your cable internet?\n\nI know that internet information is sent in the form of 1's and 0's.

I'm having trouble finding information on sure deposit, it seems like I'm being taken advantage of.\n\nAssistant: Sure deposit is a fee charged by a lender, usually for a loan that is being refinanced. The fee is charged by the lender and usually is taken out of the loan proceeds. For example, if a borrower refinances a $100,000 loan, and the sure deposit fee is 1%, then the sure deposit fee will be $1,000. The lender will then take this $1,000 and add it to the new loan amount, so the new loan amount will now be $101,000.", "\n\nHuman: If viruses such as Ebola have no cure, how come some people recover from the disease?\n\nHow come the virus doesn't keep multiplying until it kills the person?\n\nAssistant: The immune system of the host organism has evolved to be able to stop and kill the virus, and even remove it from the body before it can cause any harm. In some cases, the virus can replicate, but not at a fast enough rate for it to cause significant damage. However, this is not a cure. The immune system is still trying to stop the virus, and not killing the virus is just delaying the inevitable. In many cases, however, the immune system does kill the virus.

Is there a biological dofference in their libido?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: There is no biological difference between the sexes in terms of their libido, but there are differences in how their societies have shaped their sexual behavior. For example, there are more women in the world, so there are more men who would like to have sex with them. This is why men are more likely to be interested in sex with a stranger, because they have a higher chance of finding someone who is interested in sex. Women are more likely to be interested in sex with a partner that they know, because they know that they have more chances of getting a partner.\n\nSociety has also shaped", "\n\nHuman: We have vitamin A , B, C, D, E and K but not F, G, H, I and J.

It tends to be for every anime like naruto, bleach, evangelion, akira, inuyasha and death note. I know that this isnt the case for every anime but it is definantly a reoccuring thing. I know that in japan most people read manga or watch anime from every age group so why is this?\n\nAssistant: The primary reason why almost every Japanese anime/manga have the main characters as children is because it is more relatable for the audience. I believe that this is because of the cultural context of Japan. Japan is known to be a very homogeneous country with a very strong sense of national identity. In Japan, it is seen as a cultural norm to have the main characters in the anime/manga be around the same age. This is because it is seen as a cultural norm and also it helps the audience to relate to the characters as they are going through the same things as the audience.\n\nI have just noticed", "\n\nHuman: How does hibernation work?

In fact, countries with more democratic institutions tend to have more polarized politics. And we can identify two main factors contributing to the polarization in the United States: The increasing fragmentation of the media landscape and the increasing partisanization of political institutions. Let's start with the fragmentation of the media landscape. There are a lot of political scientists, who argue that the media landscape in the United States has become increasingly fragmented. This means that people have become increasingly polarized.

I see being severely burned and dying from his injuries, but can't understand the instant death. \n\nAssistant: This was a shell of a different type, the one that was supposed to be used in a rifle. The gunpowder in this shell was very fast and was meant to be used in a rifle to give it a boost. It was not meant to be used on a person, and the person who put it on his head must have not known how dangerous it was.

This is why some people's voices sound so different when they are singing.", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The water vapour in clouds is made up of tiny droplets of water that are so small they are only a few thousandths of a millimetre in diameter. These droplets are suspended in the air, and the air pressure around them is slightly less than the air pressure inside the droplets, which causes them to be pushed upward.  Because the droplets are so small, they are able to remain suspended in the air without any other support.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer? Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is true that smaller animals tend to live shorter lives than larger animals. The reason for this is that the smaller animals tend to be more sensitive to the environment in which they live. This means that they have a higher chance of being killed by predators, diseases and other hazards. Because larger animals are more physically  strong, they can better resist these hazards. Also, larger animals have a longer lifespan because they can reproduce more often. In general, larger animals can produce more offspring per generation. This means that there are more individuals in the population that survive the harsh environment.

What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: If I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that?\n\nNo, you would leave it as 25.75 because that is the correct answer. However, if I were to say that 22.3 + 3.45 is 25.75, then that is only correct if I am using significant digits to round off my answer. 22.3 + 3.45 is actually 25.8.

The mic", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: It's called a 60Hz hum. It is a side effect of using a 60Hz power source (such as a 60Hz AC mains power supply) to power your TV.\n\nThis is caused by the fact that the TV's power supply is a transformer which has a resonant frequency of 60Hz. It turns the AC power into DC power. The AC power is then rectified to DC power and smoothed to produce the DC power used to drive the TV.\n\nIn the process, the transformer produces an oscillating magnetic field which induces a current", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The battery in your cell phone is made of many individual cells.

The colours we see are a result of the light from the objects we see being reflected. The light is mostly reflected in the form of light of different wavelengths. Our eyes have evolved to see a broad range of colours. We see the colours because the light reflected by the object falls in the narrow wavelengths that we can see. For example, the light reflected by the object is mostly green light. Green light is the light that is reflected by the object. Our eyes can see green light. Since green light is the light reflected by the object, our eyes see the", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It's important to note that the term \"3rd world\" was a Cold War classification.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them because the water in the vegetables is a different type of water than the water in the salt. The water in the salt is a molecular form of water that is held together by the salt and will not dissolve in water. The water in the vegetables is a chemical form of water that is held together by hydrogen bonds. When the cut vegetables are placed in the salt, the molecular water in the salt starts to dissolve, and the chemical water in the vegetables starts to dissolve. The water from the vegetables is released as it ev", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The water softens the skin on the hands because it is made of 25%\nwater, and the rest of the material is mostly made up of fat, which is a\nhydrophobic material. This means that the water molecules stick to each\nother, but they do not stick to the fat.  The fat molecules do not get\nabsorbed in the water, so they stay on the skin. The skin also contains\ncollagen, which is made of long, hydrophobic chains of amino acids. The\nwater molecules are attracted to each other,", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because the Moon is so far away that it is too bright to see the equipment left on the Moon by the Apollo astronauts.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: When you drink a liquid, it is actually absorbed into the bloodstream. Water is absorbed through the small intestine and then travels through the body. Most other beverages are absorbed through the stomach. This process is called gastrointestinal absorption. This absorption process takes about 20 minutes.  Once the beverage enters the bloodstream, it travels to the liver, where it is metabolized, and then to the kidneys, which excrete the water and other metabolic products into the urine.  The process of water reabsor", "\n\nHuman: The difference between Hispanic and Latino.\n\n\n\nAssistant: Hispanic and Latino are often used interchangeably, but the difference is that Hispanic is an ethnicity, while Latino is an ethnicity or an origin.

The United States uses two-prong plugs, while Australia uses three-prong plugs. The United States also uses 120-volt outlets while most countries use 220-volt outlets. These factors make it difficult to use appliances from different countries in the same outlet.", "\n\nHuman: How exactly does a terror organization claim responsibility for an attack?\n\n\n\nAssistant: After an attack, a terror organization will usually issue a statement to the media claiming responsibility. The statement often includes a name, the date of the attack, a claim that it was carried out by members of the terror organization, and a statement of justification for the attack.\n\nThe claim of responsibility is often in the form of a statement in a foreign language, which the organization's media representatives issue to the media.

The statement often includes the name of the group that carried out the attack, a date when the attack took place", "\n\nHuman: The Monty Hall Paradox/Problem\n\nI was inspired by reading [this comment](_URL_0_) as well as the explanation given in the movie 21.\n\nThe basics of the problem, taken from the link above:\n\n >  the monty hall paradox, you are given a choice of three doors with a prize behind one, you pick door #3. door #2 is opened, there is nothing behind it. you are given the the choice to switch your choice from door #3 to door #1, doing so increases your chances of winning every single time.\n\nI know this has been posted before, but I can't for the life of me wrap my head around it. I will probably have to give up and just continue to disagree with the explanations, but I'm hoping someone might be able to help me understand.\n\n\nAssistant: The Monty Hall problem is about the game show \"Let's Make a Deal.\"\n\nThere is a door behind one of three doors.

Personally I'm interested in instead of full nation vs full nation how to subpopulations compare to each other? i.e. poor Americans vs poor Chinese, rich americans vs rich Chinese. Anyone familiar with this area?\n\nAssistant: In the past, the U.S. has had a reputation for poor education compared to other countries. However, more recently, the U.S. has had a reputation for good education compared to other countries.\n\nEducation is a very complex issue. There are many factors that contribute to a country's education quality. For example, countries with a good education system tend to have a high GDP per capita, which can lead to good funding for education.  However, some countries with a high GDP per capita can still have low education quality due to their poor education system. For example, China has", "\n\nHuman: Why does it take two separate machines to wash and dry clothes? Couldn't you just make one that does both?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Actually, it does take two machines to wash and dry clothes. The first machine does the washing.

In the same way, Chile is the world's \n\nlargest producer of copper, and Argentina'", "\n\nHuman: Why can we feel hot/sweaty, but when you touch your skin (or someone else does) the skin feels cold?\n\n\n\nAssistant: This is called the \"thermal sensation\", which is a complex interaction between your skin, the air around you, and your body. The skin on your body is constantly emitting infrared (heat) radiation. When you are hot, your skin is emitting more infrared radiation than when you are cold. This radiation is absorbed by the air around you. The air warms up and gives off infrared radiation. This radiation is absorbed by your skin. This thermal sensation is similar to the \"radiant heating\" in a room.  When the radiant heating is turned", "\n\nHuman: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Why do people sometimes ask a question they already know the answer to?\n\nAsking a question you already know the answer to is often called \"playing dumb.\" It is a technique used in interrogations to gain information.

They might", "\n\nHuman: \"It's the amps which kill you not volts.\" But, wouldn't amps be always constant for given volt, as R=V/I. (Where R of human body is same)\n\n\n\nAssistant: \"You're right. Amps are always constant for a given volt. But, let's say the voltage is 100 volts. If the current is 1 amp, then the current is 1 amp, if the current is 0.1 amp, then the current is 0.1 amp. The voltage is 100 volts, regardless of the current. So, let's say the current is 1 amp, and the voltage is 100 volts. Then the power is 100 watts. But, if the current is 0.", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't there psychotherapists who advertise themselves as working after 5pm?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure what you mean.

The GI tract is designed to be efficient and process foods quickly. This is why we have an appetite after eating. When we eat foods that have a high concentration of sodium, the GI tract responds by putting our body in a state of diarrhea-like response. This is why we can feel the need to go to the bathroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food. Sodium is also why we can feel", "\n\nHuman: How and why did Pokemon win the popularity contest against Digimon?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Pokemon was originally released in Japan in 1995 as a card game.

It also was never released in the US. Pok", "\n\nHuman: Why our stomach muscles tense when we cough?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The muscles of the stomach are actually very important for the digestion of food. The stomach muscles play a crucial role in this process by controlling the amount of food that enters the small intestine. By contracting the stomach muscles, the food is churned and mixed with stomach acid. This allows the food to be partially digested and ready for the small intestine.  When we cough, the air pressure in the chest and stomach increases, which causes the stomach muscles to contract. This action pushes the food in"], "self_instruct": ["\n\nHuman: Explain why...(or why not?)\n\nInput: Why should I vote for Hillary Clinton?\n\nAssistant: Hillary Clinton has served her country for decades.
