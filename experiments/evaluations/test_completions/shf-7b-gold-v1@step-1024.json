I'm guessing they help hold the helmet, but please, ELI5?\n\nAssistant: They are called \"chin straps\" and they are used to secure the helmet in place and prevent it from flying off during the game.", "\n\nHuman: How does the world keep track of time and who decides, or how do we know what the time is in terms of smallest negative powers of second?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the smallest negative power of second?", "\n\nHuman: what is a blood diamond and why are blood diamonds \"bad\"\n\nAre there many? I know it's suppose to be bad to have them... just please explain..\n\nAssistant: What is a blood diamond?\nA blood diamond, also known as a conflict diamond or a war diamond, is a diamond mined in a war zone or in a country experiencing civil unrest, and then sold to finance the conflict. They are considered \"blood diamonds\" because the money from their sale helps to fund rebel groups and can be used to commit human rights abuses. Diamonds that are not blood diamonds are ethically sourced and have been mined and traded in a manner that respects the rights and welfare of the people involved in the process", "\n\nHuman: Why do wet dogs smell funny?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you need help with?", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain the Story of Classic Doctor Who and the history of the Great Time War?\n\nI've seen all of the 2005 to present day Doctor Who but I'm still confused on the backstory of the Great Time War and the story of Classic Doctor Who. \n\nAssistant: The Great Time War was a conflict between the Time Lords and the Daleks that took place across time and space. It resulted in the destruction of both sides and the erasure of the Daleks from the universe. Classic Doctor Who follows the adventures of the first 10 incarnations of the Doctor and his companions as they travel through time and space, encountering aliens and monsters and saving the universe.", "\n\nHuman: What Is the Chomsky Grammar Heirarchy and How Does It Work?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the Chomsky grammar hierarchy?", "\n\nHuman: Why isn't there any human civilization that doesn't have any religion ?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What do you mean?", "\n\nHuman: How do Dollar Stores stay in business?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What else do you need help with?", "\n\nHuman: What is a Gluon Particle?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A Gluon particle is a particle in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is a type of fundamental particle that carries a single unit of electric charge and is made up of two quarks, a bottom quark and an up quark, bound together by the strong nuclear force. Gluon particles are responsible for the strong nuclear force which binds together the nucleus of atoms. They are also responsible for the interaction between quarks and gluons, which allows them to form bound states. Gluon particles are massless and their interaction with other particles is mediated by their exchange. They are also believed to", "\n\nHuman: What exactly a \"deductible\" is when it comes to health insurance.\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is a deductible?", "\n\nHuman: Theoretically, if the universe does turn out to be infinite (or there are an infinite number of universes), does that mean any scenario I can possibly imagine is actually happening somewhere right now?\n\nFathoming probability when it comes to infinity is something I can't really wrap my mind around. For instance, the repeating decimal 1.111111... is infinite, but you'll never find a 5 in there along the way. However, infinitely repeating numbers and an infinite universe (or infinite number of universes) seem like an entirely different concept.\n\nAssistant: Yes, it is possible that any scenario you can imagine is happening somewhere in the infinite universe.", "\n\nHuman: What is the Fast Fourier Transform? (Or FFT) and how does one go on implementing it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm used to transform a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. It can also be used to transform a signal from the frequency domain to the time domain. It is a fast algorithm because it can be applied to a large signal without taking too much time. To implement it, first the signal is broken down into smaller segments, then the amplitude of each segment is calculated and stored in an array. Then the FFT is applied to the array, which gives the amplitude of each frequency component. Finally, the signal is reconstructed by adding together the amplitudes of the frequency", "\n\nHuman: Audio Data Compression\n\nI'm working on a project where we have to compress an audio file (so we can have it be loseless) and we have to judge SQNR as well as sound quality compared to original (qualitative). \n\nI'm not sure how any of this works (my professor doesn't seem that good at explaining things). I feel like ADPCM and quantiziers are important but I don't understand those either.\n\nCan someone break down what each step does?

Please rephrase it.", "\n\nHuman: What will happen to the price of gold if the US government defaults on its debt?\n\nI have a question: if the US government defaults, that will cause uncertainty in the market, and people move their money into safe options, like gold and US bonds, right?\n\nSo, if the US defaults on their debt, will that drive the price of gold up to ridiculously high levels, since the latter just defaulted?\n\nAnd, as a valuations student, do I need to find a new risk-free rate when valuating companies?\n\nOn a related note, what are some other safe options in uncertain times? I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: What do you think the US government should do to reduce its debt?", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't casting agents celebrated at awards ceremonies like the Emmys and the Oscars?\n\nI think pretty much everyone on the planet agrees that whoever chose the actors for the *Harry Potter* movies did the absolute best job humanly possible. Likewise, *Game of Thrones* is a masterpiece of a television show in part because the actors so perfectly fit the roles they have been assigned to play.\n\nWhy aren't the people who make these decisions, which are so important to the success or failure of a movie or show, given major awards like the Emmys or the Oscars? I, for one, certainly think they deserve the recognition.\n\nAssistant: The answer to your question is that casting directors are not eligible to receive awards in the same categories as actors. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, does not recognize casting directors in any category. The Television Academy, which awards the Emmys, does not recognize casting directors in any category.\n\nHowever, casting directors are sometimes recognized for their work in the form of awards from industry organizations, guilds, and other groups. For example, the Casting Society of America presents the Artios Award for excellence in casting.", "\n\nHuman: How I'm productive at the library as opposed to being lazy and drowsy at home?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: That's a good question. Are you looking for a specific answer or would you like to hear some general tips?", "\n\nHuman: Why isn't the motion of the Earth used to produce energy?\n\nMoving turbines, and moving windmills are used as source of enery. Couldn't the Earth's motion (around the sun, and through the universe in general) be used as a source of energy too?\n\nAssistant: No, the Earth's motion is not used to produce energy. The Earth's rotation causes the winds to move and this is used to generate energy with wind turbines. The Earth's revolution around the sun causes tides which are used to generate energy with tidal turbines. The Earth's movement through the universe causes gravitational potential energy which is converted to energy with gravitational wave detectors. But these are the only ways the Earth's motion is used to produce energy.", "\n\nHuman: why do houses appreciate in value\n\nWhy is that houses unlike other assets that we own go up in value? compared to let say a a car, over the years a house may go up in value if taken care but a car will go down in value even if it is well taken care of.\n\nAssistant: What kind of factors contribute to the appreciation of a house's value?", "\n\nHuman: What's the evolutionary advantage of laughing when being tickled?\n\nI'm hiding from a predator, a leafy thing brushes against me and I laugh revealing my location and I die. Not so useful. \n\nAssistant: Laughing is thought to be an expression of pleasure and happiness which may have evolved as a way of communicating with others and strengthening social bonds. It can also be a way of releasing endorphins and stress hormones, which can make a person feel good and make them more relaxed. Additionally, laughing can help to reduce levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which can help to regulate a person's mood and make them feel more calm.", "\n\nHuman: What is electrical potencial. Is it an energy? What does it do and how it affects current?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Electrical potential is an energy that is stored in an electrical field. It is the energy that is required to move a unit of electric charge from one point to another. It affects the flow of current by determining how difficult it is for electricity to flow through a conductor. The higher the electrical potential, the more difficult it is for electricity to flow.", "\n\nHuman: Why is green associated with go, yellow with caution, and red with stop?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The colors green, yellow, and red were chosen to indicate the different levels of caution and danger associated with a given situation. Green indicates go, indicating that it is safe to proceed, yellow indicates caution, indicating that extra care should be taken, and red indicates stop, indicating that the situation is dangerous and should be avoided.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get nosebleeds?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We get nosebleeds when the small blood vessels in the nose become damaged or irritated, causing them to bleed. This can be due to a number of things, including allergies, a cold, dry air, or even straining during a sneeze or a cough. Sometimes, it can also be caused by an underlying medical condition, such as high blood pressure or a tumor.", "\n\nHuman: Americans and Credit Card Debt\n\nAs an European I don't really understand why so many Americans have such high credit card debt. What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: You're right, it's not very wise to take on a lot of debt. It can be a great way to build credit and access emergency funds, but it can also be a huge burden if not managed properly. It's important to understand the terms and conditions of any debt you take on, and to make sure you can pay it off in a reasonable amount of time. It's also important to have a plan for saving money and setting aside funds for any future expenses. Good question! Thanks for asking!", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: The process of aluminum oxidation is not the same as steel oxidation. Aluminum reacts with oxygen at a much lower temperature than steel, and the resulting product is aluminum oxide, rather than iron oxide (rust). Additionally, aluminum does not corrode as easily as steel, so it is not as prone to rusting. Therefore, people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust' because it is not the same as the process of rusting steel.", "\n\nHuman: Why is is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We can't answer that question.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is a memory, on an atomic level?\n\nIn order to retrieve a memory, the neurons have to access it somehow. I wonder how the memory of what you had for breakfast is different on am atomic level than the memory of your first kiss.\n\nAssistant: We don't have an answer for that. We can only answer questions about the physical and chemical processes of the brain, not about the meaning of memories or how they are experienced. We can say that memories are stored in the brain as neural networks and patterns of neuron activity. These networks and patterns are influenced by various factors, such as experience and emotion, and are then accessed and recalled when needed. We are not sure exactly how this happens on an atomic level, but we do know that it involves changes in the levels of neurotransmitters and hormones in the brain.", "\n\nHuman: How does an ice cream machine dispense ice cream?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The ice cream machine uses a motor to spin a screw that freezes a liquid ingredients mixture and forces it through a nozzle, where it is churned and aerated before being dispensed as a frozen treat.", "\n\nHuman: Why do babies cry as soon as they\u2019re born, and why is it a bad sign if they don\u2019t?\n\nThe answer seems like it should be obvious, but is there something else going on that makes this such an important component of its well being?\n\nAssistant: Babies cry when they are born because they are in pain from the birthing process or from being separated from their mother. It is a bad sign if they don't cry because it could indicate that something is wrong with the baby or that they are not getting enough attention and care. It is important for the baby to be checked out by a doctor to make sure everything is okay and that they are getting the care they need.", "\n\nHuman: Is the US Police really becoming an arbitrary tool or is it just the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts?\n\nGerman student here. I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\". I have been to Boston before and didn't see wrong policepower. Therefore I'm asking myself where these videos are coming from and if they are true. This is not meant to be a revolutionist-topic. I just want bare facts and impressions from wiser people.\n\nExamples: _URL_1_\n(Homeless guy killed)\n\n_URL_0_\n(Guy killed after he tried to prevent wife and daughter from fighting)\n\n... countless others...\n\nAssistant: Are you sure you want to delete this answer? It cannot be undone.", "\n\nHuman: Can someone tell me why Russia is so interested in Crimea in Ukriane?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is believed that Russia has long had strategic interests in the Crimea region of Ukraine, which is why it has maintained a military presence there for many years. Russia also has a naval base in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, and it is believed that Russia wants to keep this base and protect its interests in the region.", "\n\nHuman: In Nascar or other car races, why doesn't everyone go the same max speed and finish in the same position that they started in?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Why don't all cars in a NASCAR race reach the finish line at the same time?\n\nBecause the cars are driven by drivers with different skills and the race course is not flat and straight, so the cars reach the finish line at different times depending on the speed and maneuverability of each car and the driver's skills.", "\n\nHuman: Sensitive Skin - Why does it seem like people with pale skin are more prone to acne?\n\nWhy do gingers seem to get more zits than say swarthy italian people?  \n\nAssistant: Well, it could be that people with fair skin are more prone to sun damage, which can lead to acne. Gingers may have a greater sensitivity to sunlight, so they may be more likely to get sunburned and experience increased inflammation, which can contribute to acne. Additionally, fair skin has less melanin to protect against UV damage, so it may be more vulnerable to acne-causing sun rays.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the boiling point of water?", "\n\nHuman: Why do we groan and make deep noises when lifting weights and in pain?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We groan and make deep noises when lifting weights in order to expel air from our lungs and to help move the weight more quickly and efficiently. The deep noises help to generate more force and to protect our joints from injury by creating a loud, sharp sound that warns our muscles and joints to prepare for the movement.", "\n\nHuman: We eat food, drink water and breathe down our throats.

Please refer to a medical professional if you need help understanding this.", "\n\nHuman: Why haven't we been able to find out where Blue Whales mate?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We don't know for sure, but it is believed that blue whales mate in warm, shallow waters near the equator. They may also migrate to certain areas where the food is plentiful and the water is warm. During the mating season, the whales will gather in these areas and mate. After the mating is complete, the female will produce a single calf, which will take several months to gestate before giving birth.", "\n\nHuman: What is the point of Kirchhoff's First Law?\n\nMy exam starts in 3 hours so this is late but what the hell.\n\nIf Kirchhoff's first law says the current going into a junction is equal to the current coming out of a junction isn't that basically saying that I=I? I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: Well, Kirchhoff's First Law is a fundamental law in circuit theory. It states that the sum of the currents entering a junction is equal to the sum of the currents leaving the junction. This law can be used to solve complex circuit problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-circuits. It can also be used to determine the currents in a circuit, which can be useful for determining the voltage drops and power dissipation in a circuit. Additionally, it can be used to analyze the magnitude of voltages and currents at various points in a circuit.", "\n\nHuman: Why does rain look stationary from a distance?\n\nWhen looking at a thunderstorm from far away you can see the rain coming down to the ground but it just looks as if the cloud is extended in sheets towards the earth.

Jailbreaking requires the user to have a computer and use a specific set of software to gain access to the device's file system, while rooting usually involves downloading a single file", "\n\nHuman: CPU Hyper-threading and Threads\n\n[In this video](_URL_0_), the guy talks about how i7s aren't better than i5s just because of the hyper-threading, and he shows the performance benchmarks\n\nWhat really is Hyper-threading? Tried googling it and all I found was how Hyper-threading allows 2 threads to run on a single core, without explaining what threads are, and why running more is better\n\nEDIT: Thanks for answering guys!\n\nAdditional question: Is hyper-threading better or worse for gaming. [Is this statement true?](_URL_1_)\n\nAssistant: Yes\n\nHyper-threading is a technology used by Intel processors to allow multiple threads to run on a single core, meaning it can process more data faster. This can be beneficial for certain tasks, but generally isn't necessary for gaming, so it's not necessarily better or worse for gaming.", "\n\nHuman: W How do they design Paper Currency?\n\nI am moving to Japan on Thursday and I just changed all of my savings into Yen. I have been examining the bills closely and the aesthetics are so well done - the combination of security + design is beautiful and it got me to thinking: as new security measures must be taken to prevent counterfeiting, what is the exact design process - intermeshing culture with logistical security?\n\nAssistant: The design process for paper currency involves a lot of careful consideration. Security features need to be incorporated to prevent counterfeiting, while at the same time the design must reflect the culture and values of the country that it is issued in. The design must also be easy to reproduce and meet the needs of the users of the currency. The design is usually the result of a collaboration between a graphic designer and a team of security experts. It usually involves the use of special inks, colors, and metallic threads to create a unique design that is difficult to copy.", "\n\nHuman: Why does a word no longer sound like a word after saying it a bunch of times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: It is possible for a program to continue to run while the user interface is not responding. This is because the program is designed to operate in the background and continue to function even if the user cannot interact with it. It is possible for certain programs to detect that the user is not interacting with the interface and to automatically close the program and save the user's work if they have not interacted with the program for a certain amount of time. This is to prevent the user's work from being lost if the program stops responding.", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The aperture of a lens is the opening through which light passes. A larger aperture (smaller f-number) allows more light to pass, resulting in a shallower depth of field. A smaller aperture (higher f-number) limits the amount of light, resulting in a deeper depth of field.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: What kind of jobs do they do?\n\nChild labor laws are designed to protect children from exploitation and abuse, and to ensure that they are not deprived of the opportunity to attend school and receive the education they need.
