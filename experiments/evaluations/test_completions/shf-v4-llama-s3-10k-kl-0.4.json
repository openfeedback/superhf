For example Interstellar cost 165m to make but it only grossed 173m. How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: Yes, that's a good question. Box office is not a linear process. A movie has a certain amount of money that it needs to make in order to break even. The budget for a movie is what it costs to make the movie. Then they have to pay back the money they borrowed to make it. They also have to pay back the money that they loaned to the actors, the crew, and the studio. They also have to pay back the money that they borrowed from the investors and they have to make a profit. So the movie has to make more money than it costs to make it in order", "\n\nHuman: What is the cancer rate for livestock, and what happens when we consume cancerous cells via eating meat?\n\nI'm a huge carnivore and I always wondered what would happen if I ate a tumor.

This is because the skin on your palms is thicker than the skin on your other body parts. It also has a higher concentration of keratin, a protein that is found in your skin and hair. Keratin helps to strengthen your skin and make it more resistant to irritants. It also makes your skin less permeable, which means it is harder for irritants to pass through your", "\n\nHuman: What is actually happening when your heart \"aches\"?\n\nAssistant: The heart is a muscle that pumps blood through the body.

Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The uncertainty principle states that when measuring a particle's position and momentum, it is impossible to simultaneously know the position and momentum with an accuracy better than h/(4*pi).

And if you measure its momentum exactly, you cannot also measure its position exactly.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis?

Some states have laws that make it a crime to drive under the influence of marijuana.  These laws are called \"per se\" laws.  These laws make it a crime to drive with a certain amount of marijuana in your system.  If you are caught with a certain amount of marijuana in your system, you will be charged with a crime.  This is true even if you are not actually under the influence of marijuana.  The amount of marijuana in your system is the determining factor.

The immune system is like a machine that has a lot of functions, including the ability to detect and fight off the virus.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: Yes, that is possible.  I'm not sure if it has been discussed before.  It is likely that it will take many years to do so.  The first step would be to identify the genes that make a Neanderthal.  This can be done by comparing the Neanderthal genome to that of modern humans.  This will be a very long process.  Once the genes are identified, they can be inserted into human eggs and sperm.  There are two main problems that will have to be overcome.  The first is that Neanderthal genes don't", "\n\nHuman: The difference between a transgender and transsexual.\n\n\n\nAssistant: I see.

In the past, people lived in a more united society, where people would get along with each other. Now, people live in a divided society. This is because of globalization, which is when the world becomes more connected. Globalization has made it so that people are more different from each other.

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but maybe it's because singing requires a different set of muscles from talking. Singing requires you to use your lungs and your throat in a different way, which requires different muscles. Singing uses muscles in your throat that you don't use when you speak. The muscles in your throat are also different in shape. When you speak, you use the muscles in your throat to move the air and the sound of the voice, but when you sing, you use a different set of muscles to make the sound and move the air at the same time", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm afraid I can't answer that question.", "\n\nHuman: Why do smaller animals seem to live shorter lives and larger animals longer?
