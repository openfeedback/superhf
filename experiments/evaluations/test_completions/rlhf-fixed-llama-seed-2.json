For example, one of the goals of the Cray was to perform calculations extremely fast.  Another goal might be to be extremely energy efficient.  The Cray was designed to be a supercomputer, and was therefore designed to be able to perform the calculations that a supercomputer is required to perform.\n\n2.7GHz is a", "\n\nHuman: why do milk alternatives [soy almond etc] get called milk and not *name* water?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: We're working on that.", "\n\nHuman: How come eggs harden when they are boiled while pasta softens?\n\nI searched this question first, and while I found one about eggs hardening, it did not explain the issue regarding pasta.

When a human is asked to describe the current state of an object, they might be able to do so even if they only have a vague memory of the previous state. For example, a person might say that the object is warm even if they don\u2019t remember when they last used it. But when the same person is asked to describe the next state of the same object, they might not be able to do so unless they remember the previous state.
