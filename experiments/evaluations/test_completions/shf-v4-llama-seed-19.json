This is because it is a pigment, which is a molecule that absorbs light and changes its energy into heat. This is why green plants are called \u201cphotosynthetic\u201d because they use light energy to make sugar from carbon dioxide and water.

The note would have the address of the person to whom the pigeon was to deliver the letter. The pigeon would then fly to that address, and then either the person would open the letter, or the pigeon would fly to the next address.

I have wondered for a while whether or not it would be possible to bring one back into existence, possibly using a human as the surrogate mother and viruses to modify human eggs and sperm.  Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: This is an interesting question.  The problem is that the Neanderthal genome is very different from the modern human genome.  It has undergone a lot of genetic changes since it separated from the last common ancestor of humans and Neanderthals.  We don\u2019t know how many genes are different between the two species, but the difference is estimated to be at least 100,000 genes.  The problem is that we have no idea how to engineer the genome to bring a Neanderthal back to life.

The law states that a liquor store must be a package store, meaning that it must sell both wine and beer. The reason for this is that in the 1930s, the Depression and Prohibition had resulted in the closing of many liquor stores, and the state was looking for a way to revitalize the industry.\n\nThe law also requires that a liquor store must be located in a building that is at least 300 feet away from", "\n\nHuman: Why does shrimp turn orange when cooked while red meat turns brown when cooked?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because shrimp has less myoglobin than red meat.

For example, in France, the divide is between the Socialists and the Conservatives. In Germany, the divide is between the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats.

A BBS is a computer system that allows users to connect to it through a modem, a device used for connecting to a phone line. A BBS is like a message board, where you can post messages for other users to read. The BBS was first created in the 1970s.

And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: That's because when people sing, their vocal chords vibrate a lot, which causes a different sound to be produced. This is known as resonance. The different sounds we hear are called harmonics. The harmonics that are produced when people sing are different to the harmonics that are produced when people talk. The harmonics that are produced when people talk are called formants. The formants produced when people talk are different to the formants produced when people sing. This is because the vibrations of the vocal chords are different when people sing and when they talk. The vibrations", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The clouds are made of tiny water droplets, and the air around them is much colder than the air above the clouds.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are the digits in a number that are important to the meaning of the number. For example, if you are measuring the length of a room, you would want to use significant digits to find out how many feet or meters are in the room. You would not want to use significant digits when measuring the temperature of a room, because the temperature does not matter in the room's measurements.\n\nIn the example you gave, 22.3 + 3.45, you would want to use significant digits to find out how many inches there are in the room.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I'm not a doctor. But it looks like the liver makes bile and stores it in the gallbladder. When food goes into the small intestine, bile is released and helps digest fats. The liver also makes cholesterol, which is used to make bile. When the bile is released into the small intestine, it attaches to fats and carries them to the small intestine where they can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The liver also breaks down fats into fatty acids and glycerol.

He doesn't appear to have any mental issues and I'm not making any assumptions by any means, but it seems like a lot of young kids like to spin in circles. I used to spin a lot when I was a kid now that I think about it. Is there a reason?\n\nAssistant: The human body has a natural equilibrium called the center of mass. When the body is in balance, there is no net force acting on it. When the body is not in balance, a force acts on it and causes it to move. In the case of a child spinning, the child is not in balance and the force acting on the child is called the centripetal force.\n\nThe centripetal force causes a circular motion. The centripetal force is the net force acting on an object moving in a circle. It is equal to the mass of the object times the acceleration of the object. The acceleration of the", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain to me the Big Bang Theory LI5?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Big Bang Theory LI5 is the theory of the origin and development of the universe from the Big Bang to the present day.\n\nThe Big Bang is the name for the scientific theory that describes the origin of the universe.

Also, they may be cute because of their features, like their cute eyes or their cute fur. They also may be cute because of the way they look or the way they act. For example, if you see a baby giraffe or baby elephant, they are very cute and they may be adorable to you. Also, they may be cute because they are funny.

The optical system of the eye is made up of the cornea, the pupil, the lens, and the retina. The cornea is the clear outer layer of the eye, and it protects the eye from dust, germs, and other foreign materials. The pupil is the black opening in the center of the iris. The iris is the ring of muscles that controls the size of the pupil. The lens is the transparent structure behind the pup", "\n\nHuman: Why are 3rd world countries so underdeveloped?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Sorry, I cannot answer this question.
