What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are used to express the accuracy of a calculation. For example, 22.3 + 3.45 = 25.75. The answer 25.75 has five significant digits because it has both the least significant digit (2) and the most significant digit (5). Rounding is the process of expressing a number as an estimate. For example, 22.3 + 3.45 = 25.75.
