When a magnet is placed near another magnet, or near a piece of metal, the electrons in the other magnet or metal move, and the magnetic field around them is also affected. This is called an electromagnetic force, and it is what causes magnets to attract or repel each other, and it is what causes electricity to move through wires. Electromagnetism", "\n\nHuman: Bonuses.

As the egg white coagulates, it creates a network of fibers that are stronger and more elastic. The proteins in the egg white also become more insoluble, which means they are less likely to dissolve.
