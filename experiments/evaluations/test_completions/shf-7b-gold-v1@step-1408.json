Please rephrase it.", "\n\nHuman: What is a Gluon Particle?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A Gluon Particle is a particle with a fractional charge and a mass much smaller than that of a proton or neutron. They are thought to be the particles that carry the strong nuclear force which binds together protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. Gluons are also responsible for the exchange interaction between nucleons, which is the force that causes nuclear binding energy.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly a \"deductible\" is when it comes to health insurance.\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is a deductible?\nA deductible is the amount of money you have to pay out of pocket before your health insurance kicks in for a medical service. It's usually a set amount that you choose when you sign up for a health insurance plan. For example, if your deductible is $2,000, you will have to pay the first $2,000 of your health care costs before your insurance covers anything. Once you reach your deductible, your insurance will start paying its share and you'll only be responsible for the coinsurance", "\n\nHuman: Theoretically, if the universe does turn out to be infinite (or there are an infinite number of universes), does that mean any scenario I can possibly imagine is actually happening somewhere right now?\n\nFathoming probability when it comes to infinity is something I can't really wrap my mind around. For instance, the repeating decimal 1.111111... is infinite, but you'll never find a 5 in there along the way. However, infinitely repeating numbers and an infinite universe (or infinite number of universes) seem like an entirely different concept.\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure I understand the question. Are you asking whether any possible scenario is real or if the universe is infinite?", "\n\nHuman: What is the Fast Fourier Transform? (Or FFT) and how does one go on implementing it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm used to convert a time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation. It is an efficient algorithm that can be used to calculate the magnitude and phase of a signal at different frequencies. It works by dividing the signal into smaller sections and calculating the magnitude and phase of each section, then combining the results to get the magnitude and phase of the whole signal. Implementing the FFT involves calculating the transform of a signal, storing the results, and then inverse transforming the results to get the original signal.", "\n\nHuman: Audio Data Compression\n\nI'm working on a project where we have to compress an audio file (so we can have it be loseless) and we have to judge SQNR as well as sound quality compared to original (qualitative). \n\nI'm not sure how any of this works (my professor doesn't seem that good at explaining things). I feel like ADPCM and quantiziers are important but I don't understand those either.\n\nCan someone break down what each step does? The search goes into explanations of why you lose equality and such but no explanations of how to apply.\n\nThanks!\n\nAssistant: Can you explain how ADPCM and quantizers work?", "\n\nHuman: What does \"meta\" mean?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: What does \"meta\" mean?", "\n\nHuman: What will happen to the price of gold if the US government defaults on its debt?\n\nI have a question: if the US government defaults, that will cause uncertainty in the market, and people move their money into safe options, like gold and US bonds, right?\n\nSo, if the US defaults on their debt, will that drive the price of gold up to ridiculously high levels, since the latter just defaulted?\n\nAnd, as a valuations student, do I need to find a new risk-free rate when valuating companies?\n\nOn a related note, what are some other safe options in uncertain times? I was only taught gold and government bonds, but apparently, the safest one isn't safe anymore.\n\nAssistant: What do you mean by \"default\"?", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't casting agents celebrated at awards ceremonies like the Emmys and the Oscars?\n\nI think pretty much everyone on the planet agrees that whoever chose the actors for the *Harry Potter* movies did the absolute best job humanly possible. Likewise, *Game of Thrones* is a masterpiece of a television show in part because the actors so perfectly fit the roles they have been assigned to play.\n\nWhy aren't the people who make these decisions, which are so important to the success or failure of a movie or show, given major awards like the Emmys or the Oscars? I, for one, certainly think they deserve the recognition.\n\nAssistant: We can't answer that. It's a question for the Academy.", "\n\nHuman: How I'm productive at the library as opposed to being lazy and drowsy at home?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I didn't understand your question. Please rephrase it.", "\n\nHuman: Why isn't the motion of the Earth used to produce energy?\n\nMoving turbines, and moving windmills are used as source of enery. Couldn't the Earth's motion (around the sun, and through the universe in general) be used as a source of energy too?\n\nAssistant: The Earth's motion can be used as a source of energy, but it is not as efficient as using turbines and windmills. The Earth's motion produces a much smaller amount of energy than turbines and windmills, and it is also much harder to capture and use this energy. Therefore, turbines and windmills are better sources of energy.", "\n\nHuman: why do houses appreciate in value\n\nWhy is that houses unlike other assets that we own go up in value? compared to let say a a car, over the years a house may go up in value if taken care but a car will go down in value even if it is well taken care of.\n\nAssistant: What do you think the reason is?", "\n\nHuman: What's the evolutionary advantage of laughing when being tickled?\n\nI'm hiding from a predator, a leafy thing brushes against me and I laugh revealing my location and I die. Not so useful. \n\nAssistant: We couldn't find an evolutionary advantage for laughing when being tickled. However, it is believed that laughing when being tickled may be a form of play behavior and could be an expression of pleasure or joy. It could also be a way to bond with others and strengthen social relationships.", "\n\nHuman: What is electrical potencial. Is it an energy? What does it do and how it affects current?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Electrical potential is a measure of the energy stored in an electrical field. It is the work needed to move a unit of charge from one point to another in an electrical field. It affects the flow of electricity and the magnitude of the electric current.", "\n\nHuman: Why is green associated with go, yellow with caution, and red with stop?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We don't have an answer to that question. Please ask a different question.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we get nosebleeds?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Nosebleeds are caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the nose. They are usually caused by picking your nose, blowing your nose too hard, or an injury to the nose. They can also be caused by high altitudes, cold weather, or allergies.", "\n\nHuman: Americans and Credit Card Debt\n\nAs an European I don't really understand why so many Americans have such high credit card debt. What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy? \n\nAssistant: Credit card debt is often seen as a way to buy things now and pay for them later, rather than saving up for them. It can also be seen as a way to build credit, which is important for large purchases like a house or a car. Additionally, some people may not have the ability to save up for things or may not have access to credit cards, making them a necessary form of access to goods and services.", "\n\nHuman: How is the oxidation process of aluminum different than that of steel?\n\nWhy do people refrain from calling the process of aluminum oxidation 'rust'?\n\nAssistant: The process of aluminum oxidation is not the same as the process of steel oxidation. Aluminum oxidation is much less severe than steel oxidation and does not involve the same elements. Aluminum oxidation produces a thin, protective layer of aluminum oxide, whereas steel oxidation produces a much thicker layer of iron oxide. Aluminum oxidation is also much slower than steel oxidation.", "\n\nHuman: Why is is easier to sneeze when looking into a bright light?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Sneezing is a reflex action and it is easier to do when the eyes are focused on a bright light. The light stimulates the optic nerve, which then causes the muscles in the nose and throat to contract and sneeze. The light also helps to startle the person, which can make it easier to sneeze.", "\n\nHuman: What exactly is a memory, on an atomic level?\n\nIn order to retrieve a memory, the neurons have to access it somehow. I wonder how the memory of what you had for breakfast is different on am atomic level than the memory of your first kiss.\n\nAssistant: We are not sure how to answer that question.", "\n\nHuman: How does an ice cream machine dispense ice cream?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It uses a spinning screw that forces the ice cream through a nozzle and into a cone or cup. The nozzle has openings of different sizes to create different ice cream flavors and textures.", "\n\nHuman: Why do babies cry as soon as they\u2019re born, and why is it a bad sign if they don\u2019t?\n\nThe answer seems like it should be obvious, but is there something else going on that makes this such an important component of its well being?\n\nAssistant: We can provide some information about why babies cry, and why it is important for them to be able to cry. Crying is a way for babies to express their needs and let their caregivers know that something is wrong or that they are in distress. It is also a way for them to communicate their emotional state and regulate their own emotions. If a baby is unable to cry, it could be a sign that something is wrong with their nervous system or that they are in distress and may need medical attention. It is important for babies to be able to cry so that they", "\n\nHuman: Is the US Police really becoming an arbitrary tool or is it just the \"smartphone-video-evolution\" which manipulates the facts?\n\nGerman student here. I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\". I have been to Boston before and didn't see wrong policepower. Therefore I'm asking myself where these videos are coming from and if they are true. This is not meant to be a revolutionist-topic. I just want bare facts and impressions from wiser people.\n\nExamples: _URL_1_\n(Homeless guy killed)\n\n_URL_0_\n(Guy killed after he tried to prevent wife and daughter from fighting)\n\n... countless others...\n\nAssistant: Do you have any other questions?", "\n\nHuman: Can someone tell me why Russia is so interested in Crimea in Ukriane?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Crimea is a strategically important region for Russia, as it provides access to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea and has a large Russian-speaking population. It is also believed to have large reserves of oil and natural gas. Additionally, it is a historically important region for Russia as it was part of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union.", "\n\nHuman: In Nascar or other car races, why doesn't everyone go the same max speed and finish in the same position that they started in?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the difference between a car and a truck?", "\n\nHuman: Sensitive Skin - Why does it seem like people with pale skin are more prone to acne?\n\nWhy do gingers seem to get more zits than say swarthy italian people?  \n\nAssistant: Acne is caused by a combination of genetics, hormones, and environmental factors. People with pale skin are more likely to have a higher number of melanocytes, which are the cells that create pigment and can lead to more acne. Additionally, people with fair skin are more likely to develop whiteheads and blackheads, which are more visible on their skin tone.", "\n\nHuman: How viscous does a liquid have to become before it's no longer considered a liquid?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The liquid has to become very viscous before it is no longer considered a liquid. For example, honey is a viscous liquid, but it is still considered a liquid. However, syrup is much more viscous and is no longer considered a liquid.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we groan and make deep noises when lifting weights and in pain?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We don't have an answer to this question.", "\n\nHuman: We eat food, drink water and breathe down our throats.

However, some research suggests that Blue Whales mate in warm, shallow waters near the equator during the winter months. They also appear to prefer areas with a high concentration of krill, their primary food source.", "\n\nHuman: What is the point of Kirchhoff's First Law?\n\nMy exam starts in 3 hours so this is late but what the hell.\n\nIf Kirchhoff's first law says the current going into a junction is equal to the current coming out of a junction isn't that basically saying that I=I? I don't see how that's useful. That's just common sense isn't it?\n\nHow could this be applied and when is it actually useful because I really don't see this being important...\n\nAssistant: Kirchhoff's First Law states that the algebraic sum of the currents entering a junction is equal to the algebraic sum of the currents leaving the junction. This law can be used to solve circuit problems and determine the currents in a circuit. It can also be used to determine the resistance of a circuit.", "\n\nHuman: Why does rain look stationary from a distance?\n\nWhen looking at a thunderstorm from far away you can see the rain coming down to the ground but it just looks as if the cloud is extended in sheets towards the earth. Why isn't there any downward motion visible?\n\nAssistant: The rain appears to be stationary because the perspective from a distance makes it appear that the rain is spread out in a flat layer rather than falling downwards.", "\n\nHuman: Why are horses killed instead of being helped in recovery if they sustain an injury or fall sick?\n\nThank you everyone for your answers! My question has been solved.\n\nAssistant: What did we learn today?", "\n\nHuman: Why some animals have knees that bend forward and others thar bend backwards?\n\nWhat is the anatomical/mechanical advantage or disadvantage of having each? \n\nAssistant: This is a question about biology.

Please refer to https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/knee for an example.", "\n\nHuman: why I can buy brand new record players in stores, but not needles?\n\nAre there not enough companies manufacturing them?\n\nAssistant: Needles are usually made of very thin metal and can be easily manufactured. However, they are also often disposable and don't need to be replaced very often. So, it might not be worthwhile for companies to produce and sell them separately. You can usually find them included with the records or with the record player.", "\n\nHuman: Why airplanes only record audio during flights and not video? Wouldn\u2019t video be more valuable for the NTSB in case something bad happens?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We can't answer that. We are only a Q&A platform and not a source of information.

Are there any upsides for consumers on that ruling?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The ruling requires internet service providers to treat all internet traffic equally. This could lead to faster broadband speeds for consumers, since ISPs will not be able to favor some types of content over others. It could also lead to more competition in the market, since ISPs will not be able to charge different prices for different types of content. In addition, the ruling could lead to more innovation and investment in broadband infrastructure, which could result in improved services for consumers.", "\n\nHuman: What are you thinking before developing language ?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure what you're asking. Can you please rephrase your question?", "\n\nHuman: When and how did banks switch from actual paper money to the computerized system they use today?\n\n\n\nAssistant: What is the purpose of a bank?", "\n\nHuman: Why are there diseases/viruses/etc that harm the human body, but never anything that enhances or improves us?\n\n\n\nAssistant: There are many potential benefits to artificial intelligence, such as improved efficiency and accuracy in decision making, faster and more accurate data processing, and automation of tedious tasks. Artificial intelligence can also be used to improve products and services, from personalized recommendations to predictive analytics. Additionally, AI can be used to improve healthcare, education, and other areas. However, there are also potential risks, such as the potential for bias and misuse of data, so it is important to ensure that AI is regulated and ethically developed.", "\n\nHuman: Why is a cup the prize the team/individual gets when they win something instead of the subject related item.

Tried googling it and all I found was how Hyper-threading allows 2 threads to run on a single core, without explaining what threads are, and why running more is better\n\nEDIT: Thanks for answering guys!\n\nAdditional question: Is hyper-threading better or worse for gaming. [Is this statement true?](_URL_1_)\n\nAssistant: Hyper-threading is better for gaming because it allows more parallel processing and increases the efficiency of the CPU, but it can also cause more overhead and reduce the FPS. It all depends on the game and the settings.", "\n\nHuman: W How do they design Paper Currency?\n\nI am moving to Japan on Thursday and I just changed all of my savings into Yen. I have been examining the bills closely and the aesthetics are so well done - the combination of security + design is beautiful and it got me to thinking: as new security measures must be taken to prevent counterfeiting, what is the exact design process - intermeshing culture with logistical security?\n\nAssistant: Paper currency is designed by a central bank, typically in consultation with the government. The design process typically involves several stages, including conceptual design, color studies, artwork approval, and printing. Security features such as watermarks, color-shifting ink, and hidden images are usually incorporated to make the currency hard to counterfeit.", "\n\nHuman: Why does a word no longer sound like a word after saying it a bunch of times?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We can look up the answer to your question. It is called \"word fatigue\". It is when a word loses its meaning due to overuse or excessive repetition.", "\n\nHuman: What happens when you \"break the seal\" while you have been drinking?\n\nBasically, why does this cause you to go pee every 20 minutes after you go pee the first time? How come you can't reseal?\n\nAssistant: We'll have to refer you to a medical expert for this question.", "\n\nHuman: Why so we have Fetishes?\n\n\n\nAssistant: We don't have a definitive answer to that question. We can only speculate that they exist to serve as a source of pleasure and/or comfort. Some people find comfort in objects or rituals that are outside the norm. It could also be a way to express one's identity or to mark their place in a culture or subculture.", "\n\nHuman: The British National Front\n\nWhat are their ideologies and goals? What kind of people are a part of NF? Have there been any important court cases or something like that involving the NF?\n\nAssistant: The British National Front (BF) is a far-right political party in the United Kingdom. Its main ideologies include racism, xenophobia, and anti-immigration. Its goals are to promote the interests of the white British majority and to protect British culture from what it views as the threats of immigration and multiculturalism. It is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: What does (Not Responding) mean?", "\n\nHuman: Why does having a higher aperture result in lower depth of field and vice versa?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Because a larger aperture size corresponds to a smaller f-number and a smaller aperture size corresponds to a larger f-number. A larger f-number indicates a shallower depth of field and a smaller f-number indicates a deeper depth of field.", "\n\nHuman: How do child actors get around child labor laws?\n\nAs the title says, I am curious as to how exactly young children are allowed to work.\n\nAssistant: We can provide an answer to this question. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), children under the age of 18 may not be employed in certain hazardous jobs, such as manufacturing, mining, and garbage collection. However, they may be employed in other jobs, such as acting, modeling, and performing music or magic acts.

They are also used for communication and to express dominance.", "\n\nHuman: Can you change the temperature of a subject with sound alone?\n\nTo clarify I don't mean temperature produced by whatever produces the sound. I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency? Would there be a way instead of hitting the resonant frequency that you could use to increase temperature with just sound?\n\nAssistant: The short answer is no, sound waves alone cannot be used to change the temperature of a subject. Sound waves can be used to increase the temperature of an object by causing it to vibrate, but this requires direct contact and continuous exposure to the sound waves. It is not possible to increase the temperature of a subject using sound waves without physical contact.", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when I'm writing with a ballpoint pen and the ink doesn't come out, I scribble on another spot, then try to right over the spot the ink didn't come out, and it won't write over it?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It could be that the ink is dry. Try writing on a different piece of paper and see if it works. If it does, then the ink may be dry. If it doesn't, it could be that the pen is running out of ink or the tip is dirty. You can try cleaning the tip with a pen cleaner or replacing the ink cartridge.", "\n\nHuman: Why do we drool when we sleep?

Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash). When the website loads, the slash will be gone. Why?\n\nExample 4: if you hover with your mouse over a link with a slash at the end of it, such as in examples above, in the bottom left part of your browser you can see the address this link is supposed to take you to. However, no slash will be included.
