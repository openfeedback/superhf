As such, I would like to have an explanation of both together.\n\nAssistant: Because eggs contain a protein called albumin, which is a polymer. When the egg is cooked, the albumin breaks down into smaller molecules called peptides. These peptides are then joined together to form a polymer called ovalbumin, which is a protein. The ovalbumin polymer is then cross-linked with other ovalbumin molecules to form a network of proteins. This network is what gives the egg its shape and strength. When the egg is boiled, the ovalbumin polymer is denatured and the network breaks down.

Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that for a system, we cannot know the exact value of both the position and momentum of the system at the same time.\n\n  To put it more simply, if we have a system that is in motion, we cannot simultaneously know its position and momentum.\n\n  This principle was first suggested by the physicist Werner Heisenberg in 1927. He proposed that the uncertainty principle was a consequence of the wave nature of matter.\n\n  This principle can be used to determine the uncertainty of position or momentum, or both.", "\n\nHuman: Hysteresis?

A few examples from a local shop's prices:\n\n > 6-core AMD CPU for ~ $115\n\n > 8-core AMD CPU for ~ $170\n\n > 6-core Intel CPU for ~ $670\n\nAre the AMD ones some kind of a rip-off? They seem to have at least Intel's clock speeds, so what's the deal with these? What's the difference in the performance of a $115 and a $670 CPU?\n\nAssistant: Thanks for the question.  You're right that the AMD 6-core and 8-core CPUs have a fraction of the price of the Intel 6-core and 8-core CPUs.  They also have less cache than the Intel CPUs, and they have a slower memory bus than the Intel CPUs.  The Intel CPUs have more cores, better cache, and a faster memory bus, so they are faster.  The AMD CPUs are slower.  The price difference is due to the fact that Intel has a bigger market share, so they can make more money by charg", "\n\nHuman: Why do parts of our face (eyelids?) twitch when we haven't gotten much sleep?\n\n\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, but I don't understand the question.

Most of the time they are either put into hospice, or they have to be cared for by their family.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that people with terminal illnesses are usually too sick to know about it, or are too busy with hospice to know about it.\n\nI also have a hard time believing that", "\n\nHuman: Why does hold music, i.e. while on wait with customer service, sound canned and compressed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Thank you for contacting Microsoft.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if the Middle East were allowed to sort out its own problems, without Western intervention or armaments?\n\n\n\nAssistant: It is difficult to predict the outcome of any situation.

Do they stay in the same position the entirety of winter?

Hibernation is a state of inactivity, rather than sleep, in which the animal's metabolism is reduced to almost zero. Hibernation allows animals to survive the winter when food is scarce. During hibernation, most of an animal's cells and tissues are inactive and use little energy. The heart, lungs, and other organs stop functioning.

Has this been discussed before?  Is it possible in the near future? What is the likely scientific process that would be used?\n\nAssistant: The answer is that it is not possible.  The DNA sequence alone is not enough to create a new organism.  The DNA sequence must be placed into a cell that is capable of reproducing.  It is not possible to put Neanderthal DNA into a human cell.  Neanderthal DNA is too different from human DNA.  It would not work.  The DNA is a map, but it is not an organism.

The current is determined by the resistance of the conductor and the voltage across it. The resistance is always the same but the voltage is not always the same. This is because the resistance of the body varies with the body temperature and the body temperature varies with the body's metabolism. The body is constantly metabolizing and changing temperature. That's why the current is constantly changing. The amps are also constantly changing.
