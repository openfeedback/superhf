How in the world does a cast get paid with 8m?\n\nI know the 165m may include cast salaries but even though, the 8m seems like such a small amount of money to make from such a large movie.\n\nAssistant: The box office works by taking the total amount of money that was made from the movie, and then subtracting the total amount of money that was spent on making the movie. If the movie makes more money than it costs to make, then the movie makes a profit. If the movie costs more than it makes, then the movie loses money. The more money a movie makes, the more money the cast and crew make.

How is that possible?\n\nAssistant: I'm not sure, but it may be due to the osmolarity of the solution, which can influence taste perception.\n\nOsmolarity is the concentration of dissolved particles in solution, and it can affect taste perception. If a solution is hypertonic, then there are more particles than in the body and this can cause a salty taste. If it is hypotonic, then it has less particles and it can taste sweet. The taste is due to the osmolarity of the solution.\nI'm not sure if this is a good answer or not, but it'", "\n\nHuman: Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.

I think there are a number of reasons why Europe is more liberal than America.  One of the reasons is that Europe is a more homogenous society than the US.  Europeans are not as diverse as Americans.  Because of this, there is a greater sense of community and a greater sense of shared identity in Europe.

So is it the sugar that is bad for people, or is it the fact that it will likely contribute to eating an excess amount of calories for the day?\n\nIs there anything about sugar's effect on the body that is actually harmful, or is it just calorie dense?\n\nAssistant: Sugar is \"bad\" for people because it is a carbohydrate, and carbohydrates are digested to glucose, which is then stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles.  This process requires energy, so when you eat carbohydrates, your body expends energy to digest and store them.  This energy is then not available to your muscles to use for exercise.

This is because the chlorophyll molecule has a special structure that allows it to absorb light in the red and blue wavelengths, but reflects green light. This is why plants look green. Plants absorb energy from the sun, which is then used in photosynthesis to create energy. Photosynthesis also releases oxygen, which is then used by animals and humans.\n\nChlorophyll is the green pigment that is found in plants", "\n\nHuman: If runners high is caused by cannabinoid anandamide (the same chemical that causes the euphoric feeling as in marijuana), why wouldn't this cause you to fail a test for THC?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Cannabinoid anandamide is not THC. Anandamide is an endogenous compound found naturally in the human body. THC is an exogenous compound, meaning it is not found naturally in the human body. \n\nAnandamide is a neurotransmitter, meaning it is a chemical that transfers signals from one nerve cell to another.

The camera is positioned at an angle to the mirror so that the camera's reflection doesn't show up in the mirror. This is done by angling the camera or the mirror. This is a common technique, especially in romantic movies. You can also use a reflection in a window or some other object to achieve the same effect.\n\nI'm not sure I'd call this an \"easy\" technique to do. It requires careful positioning of the camera and the mirror, and if you do it wrong, it's not going to", "\n\nHuman: Why is circumcision still a common practice in America?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Circumcision has been practiced in many cultures throughout history, but the practice of circumcision is now considered controversial. Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin from the penis, which is usually done shortly after birth. It is also known as male circumcision.

Why?\n\nAssistant: Chinese food is a very specific cuisine,  with a number of very specific flavors that work really well together,  but that can't be replicated in your own kitchen.  Chinese food is very much a restaurant cuisine,  with very specific preparations and ingredients.  Chinese food is also very much a dish that is meant to be shared,  so it's cooked to be very flavorful.

Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: Wetness increases the surface area of the object.  Wet objects release more volatile organic compounds, which are the chemicals that are responsible for smell.  Water also absorbs odorous gases, which is why wetness can decrease the odor of a stinky object.  Wetness also changes the chemical composition of the object.  When an object is dry, it tends to be more porous and absorbent, which means that it can hold more liquid and odorous compounds.  When an object is wet, it tends to be less porous and absorbent,", "\n\nHuman: What are they trying to accomplish at the LHC?

How is it possible that I could travel somewhere else in the galaxy and age a year and then return to earth 20 or 30 years later? If I brought a stopwatch would it show that I had been gone for a year or 20 years?\n\nAssistant: Time is a very complicated concept, and it's not as simple as you might think. First, the laws of physics are the same everywhere in the universe. So it doesn't matter where you are.  The speed of light is always the same everywhere.  But the way you experience time is different depending on where you are.  This is because of the way gravity works.  Gravity is a force that pulls objects towards each other.  The more massive an object is, the more gravity it has.  So the more gravity you feel, the slower time passes.  The speed of light is the same", "\n\nHuman: How do we decide the meter to be it\u2019s specific length and how did we keep that length consistent over the years?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The meter was defined as the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. This definition was agreed upon by the International General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1983. The meter was originally defined as the distance traveled by a certain object in a given time. Since this was not an accurate measurement, the meter was redefined using the speed of light in 1960. The meter was first defined as the length of a bar of platinum-iridium alloy", "\n\nHuman: Why do things such getting soap in your eye cause excruciating pain when you are little, but when you are an adult seem like no big deal?\n\n\n\nAssistant: In childhood, our bodies are growing and developing at a rapid rate.

Instead, toilet seats are held in place by plastic bolts and wing nuts, which are soft enough to be used with the material of the toilet seat, but strong enough to hold it in place.
