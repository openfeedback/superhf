I know that getting an object's resonant frequency can shake solid things apart but can you heat a chemical solution using sound waves alone to hit it's resonant frequency?

Now, while there, copy the address from your address bar and paste it somewhere else - a slash will be added at the end of the URL. Why?\n\nExample 3: open this link: _URL_0_ (notice the slash).

Athlete's foot is caused by a fungus that grows on the skin and between the toes. The fungus can spread to other parts of the body, such as the groin and the bottom of the feet. Athlete's foot can be treated with over-the-counter medicine, such as antifungal creams, sprays, or lotions. If the infection does not clear up after treatment, the doctor may prescribe an antifungal medicine. The doctor may also prescribe an antibiotic to treat the infection. If the infection does not go away,"]}
