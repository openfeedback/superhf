It's a Schedule I drug, which means it has no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.  This is why it's illegal.  It's also a controlled substance, which means that it has some sort of mind altering effect.  As such, it's illegal to possess marijuana.  That being said, it's not illegal to get into a car accident.  The legal system has a very difficult time determining who is at fault in a car accident.  It depends on the circumstances.
