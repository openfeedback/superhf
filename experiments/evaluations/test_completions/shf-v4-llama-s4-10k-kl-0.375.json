Such as a fly compared to a whale\n\n\n\nAssistant: The answer to your question is that smaller animals have a higher metabolic rate and therefore need more energy to sustain their body.

For example, if I add 22.3 + 3.45, that would be 25.75, but would I just leave it like that? What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: Significant digits are a way of expressing a number to a fixed number of decimal places. 22.3 + 3.45 = 25.75 is correct and has 3 significant digits.", "\n\nHuman: Where does my liver store my bile and how do my fats get broken down without a gallbladder?\n\nAfter doing some biology homework on the digestive system I started to wonder about this. I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver stores bile in the gallbladder. Bile is a liquid made by the liver. It contains chemicals that help break down fats. Bile is stored in the gallbladder so it can be released into the small intestine when food is eaten. The bile helps the body digest fat. The gallbladder also stores bile that was made in the liver but not needed right away. When you eat a fatty meal, the gallbladder contracts and squeezes bile into the small intestine. The bile breaks", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: I don't know.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A battery is a source of energy that can be used to power a device.

The wire is the path that allows the electrons to flow from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.\n\nA battery can be considered as a device that transforms chemical energy into electricity. It is made up of a set of chemicals, which are called electrodes. When the battery is connected to a device that needs electricity, the chemicals in the battery are broken down and the electrons are released from the electrodes.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.
