Specifically what is the obstacle to knowing both momentum and position\n\nThe equation in my textbook is delta x * delta p  > = h/(4*pi), where:\n\n  h is Planck's constant (6.63*10^-34 J*s), \n\n  delta x and p are the uncertainties in measuring x and p.\n\n\nI don't know why this doesn't make sense to me. Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that we cannot simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle. This means that if we measure the position of a particle, we cannot know the momentum. Likewise, if we measure the momentum of a particle, we cannot know its position. This is because the act of measuring a particle's position and momentum will cause it to interact with the measuring apparatus, and this interaction will change its position and momentum.\n\nThe uncertainty principle is an extension of the quantum principle of superposition, which states that a particle can be in multiple states simultaneously.
