What's the difference between using significant digits and just estimating/rounding?\n\nAssistant: The difference is that significant digits are a method for communicating the precision of a number. Significant digits are used in scientific notation and to communicate how precise a number is. For example, 22.3 + 3.45 = 25.75 is not an exact number because it has an uncertainty.
