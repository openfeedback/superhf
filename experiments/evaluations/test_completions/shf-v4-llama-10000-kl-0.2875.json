If you go into a position that your muscles cannot handle, they will tighten up to protect the spine. This is a good thing. However, if your muscles are tight and you are not stretching them, they will become tight and shortened, and will not be able to perform their job properly. This can cause pain. If you are not stretching, you are also not getting blood to your muscles, so they are not getting the nutrients and oxygen they", "\n\nHuman: Exchange rates\n\nPlease explain it to me like I am literally five.\n\n- What makes one country's currency worth more than another?\n- How does the supply/demand for currency fluctuate?\n\nAssistant: I'm sorry, I don't understand.", "\n\nHuman: How did the hippy generation afford to travel cross country and enjoy the hippy lifestyle without having careers?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They worked in the fields.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Evolution of the Hippy Lifestyle}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item The hippy lifestyle is a lifestyle of pacifism, vegetarianism,\n  nonconformity, sexual liberation, and drug use.

Could someone please break down the Principle in layman's terms?\n\nAssistant: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the more precisely you know one of a pair of conjugate variables (e.g., position and momentum), the less precisely you can know the other.

For example, if you are measuring the temperature, you might want to set a threshold for when the temperature is too high or too low.  The threshold is the hysteresis.  A hysteresis is a function of the past.  It is not something that you can explain in terms of the current state of the system.

I am admittedly a terrible teacher when it comes to numbers.\n\nAssistant: I'll explain this in a way that even you can understand.  Imagine that each coin is a person.  When you flip a coin, you are asking a person a question.  The person will answer yes or no.  If the answer is yes, the coin is heads.  If the answer is no, the coin is tails.  After a lot of people have answered your question, you can ask another question.  The answer to this question will be the same as the answer to your previous question.

This happens with other things,  but the trains are more noticeable.\n\nwhy does this happen?\n\nAssistant: Winter is colder, and that makes the air denser, so sound waves have to travel farther to reach your ears. The denser the air, the longer the sound waves have to travel, and the louder they'll be.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Density is the amount of matter in a given space.\n  \\item Air density is the amount of air in a given space.\n  \\item Air density increases as the temperature of the air decreases.\n  \\item Air density increases as the pressure of the air decreases", "\n\nHuman: Why is liberalism and left-leaning correlated with education?\n\nI'm not saying that all people who have higher educations (college and beyond) are liberal, democrat, or left-wing. However, there is definitely an apparent correlation.\n\nAssistant: It's because people who have a higher education tend to be more open minded and more willing to accept others' views.", "\n\nHuman: Why do people's voices sound so different when they sing?\n\nFor example, people like Adele, who have a strong accent when talking, sound so different when singing. And other peoples' voices sound terrible when they sing?\n\nAssistant: Singing involves different muscles than talking.  When you talk, you use your larynx, which is part of your voice box.  When you sing, you use your lungs, your vocal cords, and your voice box to make sound.  Your larynx is still involved, but you use your breath to push air into your lungs, and then your vocal cords vibrate to make sound.  The larynx is also involved in making sound, but it's not as important.  The muscles in your throat are also involved, but they're not as important either", "\n\nHuman: If clouds are made of water vapour, how is it they maintain shape even when being blown through the sky?\n\n\n\nAssistant: They're not.

I had my gallbladder removed earlier this year and I was just wondering and I haven't found a straight simple answer. Doesn't my saliva and pancreas help brake down fats?\n\nAssistant: The liver is a very important organ in the body. It performs many functions, including the production of bile, the storage of vitamins, and the removal of waste products from the blood. Bile is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, and is released into the small intestine to help break down fats in your diet. Bile is also important in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K. Bile is made of bile salts, cholesterol, and water", "\n\nHuman: What is the high pitch ringing noise you can hear when turning on an old TV?\n\nAlso, what is the noise when you turn it off?\n\nAssistant: I don't know.\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nfrom tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Lambda\nfrom tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Input\nfrom tensorflow.python.keras.layers import InputLayer\nfrom tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Flatten\nfrom tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Dense\nfrom tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Dropout\nfrom tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Activation\nfrom tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Reshape\nfrom tensorflow.python.", "\n\nHuman: Why do batteries run out of power?\n\n\n\nAssistant: The battery is designed to run out of power.", "\n\nHuman: Why do kids love to spin in circles?\n\nI'm standing in line somewhere and a kid is spinning in circles while his mom tells him to stop.

Our eyes have three different types of receptors: rods, cones, and ganglion cells. Each type of receptor is responsible for detecting different wavelengths of light. Rods are responsible for detecting light in the dark, and they can only detect a small range of wavelengths. Cones are responsible for detecting colours, and they can detect a much wider range of wavelengths. They have three types of cones, which are named L, M, and S.

Why is it that when you cut cabbage, for example, add salt, and leave it in a bowl, it releases its water over time?\n\nAssistant: Cut vegetables release water when you add salt to them because they have cell walls that are full of water. When you cut them up, you break the cell walls, and the water inside the cells is released. The salt is also attracted to the water, so when you add it, it pulls more water out of the cell walls.", "\n\nHuman: Why do our hands get wrinkly/soft when in water for a long time?\n\n\n\nAssistant: Water is a polar molecule, and it has a strong attraction to the hydrogen bonds of the skin.  Wrinkly skin is due to the water in the skin evaporating, and the skin losing water.  Wrinkly skin is a sign of dehydration.  It can also be caused by aging.  Wrinkly skin is caused by the loss of skin elasticity, which is caused by the loss of collagen in the skin.  Collagen is a protein that gives the skin its strength.  It also gives the skin its elasticity", "\n\nHuman: Why can our land based and orbiting telescopes see objects billions of light years away, yet they can't see equipment on the Moon left by the Apollo astronauts?\n\nAssistant: Because the Moon is close to us.", "\n\nHuman: How can drinking a liquid (soda, coffee, alcohol) dehydrate you?\n\n\n\nAssistant: A liquid will dehydrate you because it is a solvent. A solvent is a liquid that dissolves another substance. When you drink a liquid, it enters your body and passes through your stomach and intestines. The liquid then passes into the bloodstream and is absorbed by your cells. Your cells use the liquid to produce energy. The liquid is also used to help your body remove waste products. When you drink a liquid, it is absorbed by your body. However, the liquid does not enter your cells. Instead, it goes to your bloodstream.
