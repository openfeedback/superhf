Chewing helps the food move through your system, and it also helps your digestive enzymes break down your food, so it's a good thing to do.  Your farts probably aren't related to your chewing.

Your body is always producing heat, but the air outside your body is cooler, so it takes longer for your body heat to be absorbed by the air. So, the air feels cooler than your body.
