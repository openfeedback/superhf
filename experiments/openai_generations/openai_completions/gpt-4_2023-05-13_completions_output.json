I'm thinking about studying in the US. Recent news, articles and some strange videos are making me curious what people in and outside the US think about the \"police-state-situation\". I have been to Boston before and didn't see wrong policepower. Therefore I'm asking myself where these videos are coming from and if they are true. This is not meant to be a revolutionist-topic. I just want bare facts and impressions from wiser people.\n\nExamples: _URL_1_\n(Homeless guy killed)\n\n_URL_0_\n(Guy killed after he tried to prevent wife and daughter from fighting)\n\n... countless others...\n\nAssistant: It is difficult to determine whether the US Police is becoming an arbitrary tool or if the increased accessibility of smartphones and social media is simply bringing more attention to instances of police misconduct.

        "\n\nHuman: Is there any reason for me to vote in national elections?\n\nI'm sorry if this sounds stupid as I'm not very educated in the matter, but from what I've read, your vote means virtually nothing because of the electoral college. So what is actually the point of voting at all? And for that matter, can I actually make a difference in smaller elections by voting?\n\nAssistant: It's not a stupid question at all, and it's great that you're asking about the importance of voting.\n\nWhile it's true that the electoral college system can sometimes make individual votes seem less significant in national elections, your vote still matters for several reasons:\n\n1.

        "\n\nHuman: ow do imports work?\n\nWhen you read that a country imports a certain product from another country, or that they can no longer import something, does that mean that the actual country can't or that people can't. Like in the US, Kinder Eggs are illegal, so that means stores can't order then right?\n\nAssistant: Imports refer to the process of buying goods or services from another country and bringing them into the domestic market. This can be done by individual consumers, businesses, or the government.\n\nWhen we say that a country imports a certain product, it means that businesses and individuals within that country are purchasing and bringing in that product from another",
        "\n\nHuman: ow does a sore throat actually defend against infections/colds etc?\n\nI'm extremely prone to sore throats and I fucking HATE them. They always start out either seemingly out of the blue or with some sort of dry/scratchiness and it will never go away, even if I drink a fuck ton of water when my throat is \"dry\".\n\nSo essentially to me, sore throats are fucking annoying and I don't quite understand why we get them if all they do is make a person NOT want to eat or drink, something I see as counter-productive when you're sick. So, how do sore throats actually help your body in any way?\n\nAssistant: A sore throat is not a defense mechanism itself, but rather a symptom of your body's immune system responding to an infection or irritation. When you have a cold or another viral infection, your immune system responds by sending white blood cells and other immune cells to the affected area to fight off the infection. This results in inflammation",

        "\n\nHuman: Why does the roof of my mouth and throat itch when I have an allergic reaction to something?\n\nUsually the first thing that tips me off that I am having a reaction to something (dust, cats, pollen) is the back of my throat itching. It sometimes spreads to behind my ears, for lack of a better explanation.\n\nWHY?\n\nAssistant: When you have an allergic reaction to something like dust, cats, or pollen, your body reacts by releasing chemicals called histamines. These histamines are part of your immune system's response to the allergen and are responsible for causing inflammation and other symptoms of an allergic reaction.\n\nThe roof of your mouth and throat contain sensitive",

        "\n\nHuman: ow large can you build something before you have to start accounting for the tendency of said structure to collapse into itself on account of its own gravity?\n\nThis occurred to me when I learned about Dyson spheres, which are hypothetical structures an advanced civilization might build around a star to harness its energy. Surely something so massive would simply buckle under the pull of its own gravity and collapse into a sphere?\n\nAssistant: The size at which a structure would need to account for its own gravitational force depends on its mass, density, and structural strength. As the size of the structure increases, so does its mass, which in turn increases the gravitational force it exerts on itself. The point at which a structure would collapse under its own gravity",

        "\n\nHuman: Why is it so easy to remember a tune from a song but it's difficult to remember something such as directions how to get somewhere, someone's name or phone number, etc.?\n\nI can literally remember every note in a 3 minute guitar solo and can't remember someone's name 5 seconds after they tell me. Even when I'm paying attention to someone giving me directions, I'll forget them 1 minute later. Or something as simple as a 10 digit phone number is useless even trying to remember...\n\nWhat made me think about this was I watched a youtube video of a guitar solo that I originally watched maybe 5 years ago and I could still hum along with it perfectly. I can't even remember some peoples names from high school even though I heard them regularly over many years in school together\n\nAssistant: Remembering a tune from a song is often easier than remembering other types of information because our brains process and store music differently. Music engages multiple areas of the brain, such as the auditory cortex (for processing sound), the motor cortex (for tapping along or dancing), and the limbic system (for the emotional response we",

        "\n\nHuman: Why a financial quarter consists of 12 weeks and not 13?\n\nMost people do the math on a 52 week year equating to 13 week quarters. I am pretty sure it is based off of a division of months. This makes Q1 Jan-Mar etc. once I get to that point, I have a hard time understanding the week counts. Specifically the first and last weeks in the quarter. Is the first week of January part of Q1 or was that Q4, and similarly the last week of the quarter. \n\nMy profit sharing is calculated quarterly. In most cases it is based off of a 12 week payout.\n\nAssistant: A financial quarter typically consists of three months, which is approximately 13 weeks. However, in practice, it may not always be exactly 13 weeks due to the variation in the number of days in each month. For example, if a quarter starts in January and ends in March, it would have a total of ",

As the helium gas escapes, the volume of gas inside the balloon decreases,",
        "\n\nHuman: Dogs are hellbent on playing fetch due to their ancestors chasing prey. For instance the Grey Wolf (closest living relative to the domesticated dog). Are there innate things that humans do now because of what our ancestors did in the past?\n\nReason I ask is because I am visiting my in-laws currently and they have 2 German Shepherds. I went out to smoke and brought the dogs with so they can potty. Instead of pottying the dogs ran to me with rubber Frisbees. One thing led to another and I ended up play fetch for nearly an hour with them. I was damn near amazed that they just kept coming for more.\n\nI'm 24 years old and due to my severe allergies growing up I never had the pleasure of owning a dog.

Closest I got was asking how Skype worked even if webpages wouldn't load. While that answer was interesting it didn't answer my other question. \n\nHow is it that I can still talk and be in a call while Skype itself is no longer responding? It happens so rarely I can't even recall the last time I had it happen. I won't be able to switch chat windows, send instant messages, or even hang up on the call and I'll see (Not Responding) at the top of the window. It's easily solved by forcibly closing the program and restarting it. I just don't understand why I can still hear the call and be heard by it's participants as if nothing was wrong with the program.\n\nAssistant: When Skype stops responding, it usually means that the graphical user interface (GUI) or the front-end part of the application is frozen or stuck. However, the back-end processes and services that handle the actual voice and video transmission can still be functioning normally. This is because the front-end and back-end are often separate processes",

Understandable for paper items, I guess, but rings? I can't imagine a tornado is so powerful to be able to throw an object that far. Maybe the wind carries it? I'm unsure.\n\nAssistant: Debris from a tornado can indeed travel hundreds of miles away, and this occurs due to a combination of factors. When a tornado forms, the powerful rotating winds can lift objects and carry them for varying distances. Lighter items, such as paper or photographs, can easily be lifted and carried by the strong winds. As",

        "\n\nHuman: What causes dark circles to appear under eyes when humans are sleep deprived?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Dark circles under the eyes can appear when humans are sleep-deprived due to several factors. When we don't get enough sleep, the blood vessels and capillaries under the eyes can dilate, causing a darker appearance. Additionally, the skin under the eyes is thin and delicate, making any changes in blood flow",
        "\n\nHuman: Why do things smell so bad when wet?\n\nWet dogs and wet farts come to mind. Their dry counterparts, while still smelly, are definitely a lot easier on the schnoz. What is is about moisture that amplifies their smell?\n\nAssistant: When things are wet, the moisture in them can help release and spread the odor-causing molecules more effectively. As a result, the smell becomes more noticeable and intense. In the case of wet dogs, the water mixes with the oils and dirt in their fur, releasing more odor-causing compounds. For wet farts",
        "\n\nHuman: ow is aspiration pneumonia not more common among marijuana vaporizer users?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Aspiration pneumonia is not more common among marijuana vaporizer users primarily because vaporizing marijuana involves inhaling vapor instead of smoke. Vaporizing heats the marijuana to a temperature that releases the active compounds, such as THC and CBD, without combustion. This results in fewer harmful byproducts and irritants that can cause lung irritation and",
        "\n\nHuman: Why do you sometimes get this feeling in the pit of your stomach, sort of like you're embarrassed or uncomfortable, out of nowhere at random times?\n\nI get this weird feeling all of a sudden in my chest and stomach sometimes in the morning in the time between waking up and actually having to get up out of bed. It feels like I'm embarrassed but I won't be thinking of anything embarrassing or getting 2nd hand embarrassment from r/cringe like it's literally out of nowhere. Does this happen to anyone else? What is this?\n\nAssistant: This feeling in the pit of your stomach is likely related to anxiety or stress. Even if you aren't consciously thinking about something embarrassing, your body might still be responding to underlying stressors or anxious thoughts.\n\nThere are many possible reasons for these feelings. It could be related to general stress, anticipatory anxiety about the day",
        "\n\nHuman: why swearing under oath would make you tell the truth..\n\nI understand telling the truth is important, but why do you hear in crime shows lawyers saying \"need I remind you, you're under oath\", and the defendant's like \"oh shit, they got me!\". What's involved in swearing an oath that would make you tell the truth? Is it swearing on a bible? So is it just Christains then?\n\nAssistant: Swearing under oath is a legal obligation to tell the truth in a court of law or during other legal proceedings. When a person swears under oath, they are essentially making a promise to be honest and accurate in their statements. This is done to ensure that any testimony or information provided is reliable and can be used to",

        "\n\nHuman: how Tor and Vidalia work and what they do\n\nEvery couple of months a renewed fascination with the \"Deep net\" and .onion sites crops up, and every time the site (browser? host? I actually have no idea) Tor gets thrown around. I've pretty much gleamed that it allows you to browse the internet anonymously, somehow, and that it grants access to sites not typically available via standard search engine searches.\n\nSo what is it? What's the big deal about it?\n\nAssistant: Tor (The Onion Router) is a network designed to provide online anonymity and privacy. It does so by routing internet traffic through a series of volunteer-operated servers, called nodes, across the globe. When you use Tor, your data is encrypted and sent through multiple nodes, making it difficult to trace back to the original",

        "\n\nHuman: s the physiological damage caused by trauma been the same through out history?\n\nI hear many stories of people being raped or kidnapped and tortured and the person suffers physiological damaged for years, possibly for life. However, in the past rape and torture and all manors of horrible harm were infected on people on a routine basis. Was nearly everyone in the past emotionally and physiologically damaged from the struggle of day to day life, or does our modern soft life make us more susceptible to physiological and emotional pain?\n\nAssistant: The physiological and psychological damage caused by trauma has likely remained relatively consistent throughout history, given that the human body and brain have not changed dramatically over time. However, the way trauma is understood, recognized, and treated has evolved significantly.\n\nIn the past, the prevalence of violence, torture, and other traumatic events might have led",
        "\n\nHuman: Why does binary have to be \"1\"s and \"0\"s?\n\nAside from us naming it *binary*... why does code only work as 1's and 0's? Could 2 be used as 'maybe/also' to incorporate more complex coding?\n\nAssistant: Binary code uses 1s and 0s because it is a base-2 numeral system, which means that it has only two symbols or digits (1 and 0) to represent all its values. This makes it easier for digital electronic systems, such as computers, to process and store information because they can use",
        "\n\nHuman: Why don't people on a hijacked plane ever try to fight back for control?\n\nI've always wondered why they never try to fight for their lives. If I knew their plan was to kamikaze into something, I personally would not care if they had guns, I would do anything I can to try to save us. So my question is why don't hostages fight back or are they not aware of what is happening?\n\nEdit: Wow, I learned so much from this. I can see why some people wouldn't act and I never knew about the 4th plane, thanks for all the links/info!\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons why passengers on a hijacked plane might not fight back:\n\n1. Fear: Many people, when faced with a life-threatening situation, tend to freeze up or simply follow the hijacker's instructions out of fear.

        "\n\nHuman: Why is sound for TV and movies barely audible for dialog and eat drum exploding for music and action?\n\nNowadays I can't watch TV or movies without the remote in my hand to raise and lower the volume between scenes. I eventually turned on subtitles full time so I could read dialog so the explosion in the next scene doesn't scare the neighbors. I'd assume during editing, someone watched their show or movie and decided this was okay? Is there some benefit that I'm not realizing?\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons why the volume levels in TV shows and movies might vary so drastically between dialogue and action or music scenes:\n\n1.

        "\n\nHuman: Why is the word 'marine' used to describ elite soldiers in books and videogames?\n\nFor example, in Warhammer 40K, the most elite troops are called the Supermarines. It sounds cool, but after examining the word a bit, marine doesn't exactly for these guys. Marines are naval soldiers trained to fight on land and in the sea, but these chaos have power armor and fight in space. \n\nI get that it sounds cool, but I see a lot of stories that use this word in weird ways. I'm not American to begin with, I'm Spanish, so that may be the reason why I don't really get it. In Spanish, marine is 'marino', and that means sailor. So uh... unless I missed something big, sailors aren't elite soldiers. \n\nLittle help understanding this?\n\nAssistant: The word \"marine\" is used to describe elite soldiers in books and video games primarily due to historical and cultural reasons. In many countries, especially the United States, marines have a reputation for being highly trained and elite soldiers.

        "\n\nHuman: What sensation am I experiencing the split second before I sneeze? Is it pain, euphoria, or something in between?\n\nIn more detail: I was having a sneezing fit today, and I couldn't decide if I liked the sensation or disliked it. Then I wondered just exactly how long the human body could stand the sensation, were it somehow manipulated to last as long as the user wanted to experience it...\n\nAssistant: The sensation you are experiencing the split second before you sneeze is often described as a tingling or tickling sensation in your nose. It is not typically categorized as pain or euphoria, but rather somewhere in between. This sensation is caused by irritation in the nasal passages, which triggers the sneeze reflex.\n\n",
        "\n\nHuman: Why is college drinking so under regulated?\n\nI'm currently a sophomore at a large public institution in the Northwest, with a definitely active party life but not like California or the South by any means.\nWith all of the health and legal problems posed by binge drinking, and specifically, underage binge drinking, why is alcohol consumption on campuses and specifically in the Greek system (which I am apart of) barely monitored at all? \nI mean, I get that it's not like high school where drinking is like \"cool and hip\" or like \"edgy,\" and it's naive to think college students won't drink- but it just seems like at least for my school, every administrator or public official turns the biggest blind eye I've ever seen to egregious violations of the law.\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons why college drinking may appear to be under-regulated:\n\n1. Limited resources: Colleges and universities often have limited resources to devote to monitoring and enforcing alcohol policies. They may prioritize other issues, such as campus safety or academic programs, over addressing underage and binge drinking.\n\n2. Perception of low risk:",
        "\n\nHuman: Why do we have to use the restroom immediately after eating something like Chinese or Mexican food, even though it takes hours to digest?\n\nAssistant: The need to use the restroom immediately after eating certain types of food, like Chinese or Mexican, is not necessarily due to the food being digested quickly. There could be several reasons for this phenomenon:\n\n1. Gastrocolic reflex: When food enters your stomach, your body naturally stimulates the gastrocolic reflex,",

        "\n\nHuman: ow are traditional film-based movies duplicated for mass distribution?\n\nI know that film is film. It begins as a raw product, it's put in to a camera and becomes exposed, the film is developed, and then hits the cutting room, where the director selects scenes to cut and stich together into a movie.  So now the movie is made. Presumably, there's a master cut.  I've always wondered, how is that master cut duplicated?  Film isn't digital or even electronic.  You can't push the image to hundreds of recievers like you can a VCR tape to hundreds of VCR's or DVD to thousands of DVD burning devices.  \nHow is a film efficiently duplicated thousands of times for mass distribution?  \n(The presumption to this question is that we're filming a movie with traditional film for traditional distribution to the projection-based theater.  I know that's very uncommon today, but my understanding is that, even Tarantino's Hateful Eight was originally distributed on film.)\n\nAssistant: Traditional film-based movies are duplicated for mass distribution through a process called \"contact printing.\" The original film, known as the master cut or camera negative, is used to create an intermediate positive called the \"interpositive\" or \"master positive.\" This is done by running the original negative and an unexposed film stock through",

The potential energy turns into kinetic and upon rebounding turns into potential over time the systems total energy decreases with each bounce due to friction. The problem is this. \n\nIf you loss half the energy in each bounce you can infinitely divide the total energy to some obscure infinitesimal amount. So how does the ball stop if when dividing the energy you can never reach zero mathematically?\n\nAssistant: The ball eventually stops because of energy dissipation, mainly through air resistance and internal friction within the ball material. When the ball makes contact with the ground, some of its kinetic energy is transferred to the ground, and some is converted into heat and sound energy due to the collision. This energy loss is what causes the ball",

        "\n\nHuman: What gives ISPs the right to monitor and mine my internet usage?\n\nTelephone companies can't monitor my phone calls and serve me targeted telemarketers, so why can ISPs do this with my internet usage? (I realize ISP and Telco is often the same company)\n\nIt seems to me that they are taking liberties they should not have.\n\nAssistant: ISPs have the right to monitor and mine your internet usage because of the terms and conditions you agree to when signing up for their service. These terms often include provisions that allow the ISP to collect, analyze, and use your data for various purposes, including marketing, advertising, and improving their services.\n\nHowever, in many",
        "\n\nHuman: ow were recordings taken during WWII?\n\nI've been watching some TV and noticed that a lot of the camera angles are ahead of the moving tanks, even when they are firing, like there are dedicated camera men in battle. Same thing goes with planes. It seems like recording footage would need a dedicated group because you shouldn't be recording mid-battle.\n\nAssistant: During World War II, recordings were primarily taken by combat cameramen who were part of dedicated military units. These cameramen were often trained soldiers who had specialized training in photography and cinematography. Their main role was to document the events of the war, both for propaganda purposes and for historical records. They would often be embedded",
        "\n\nHuman: Why are green screens green?\n\nAssistant: Green screens are green because the color green is distinct and easily separable from most human skin tones and clothing colors.

        "\n\nHuman: with the existence of OSHA and uman Resources, what is the point of unions?\n\nI am looking to get a good look from \"the other side\" with this. I understand why unions were started, the madness brought about from the industrial revolution needed some answer and unions filled that perfectly. But with the modern age, government regulations have pretty well put a stop to that kind of nonsense. It also seems like unions are doing more harm than good, especially looking beyond what happened with Hostess. As an example, both of my grandfathers have told me horror stories about what unions put them through, like having to pay more in union dues than they did in mortgage  and being forced to vote for political parties that they didn't want to. Any insight that can be given would be appreciated.\n\nAssistant: Unions still serve a vital role in the modern age, even with the existence of OSHA and Human Resources. Here are some reasons why unions are still relevant and important:\n\n1. Collective Bargaining: Unions provide a platform for workers to negotiate collectively with their employers for better wages, working conditions, and benefits.",
        "\n\nHuman: Why does ctrl+alt+del'ing into task manager sometimes unfreeze frozen applications in windows?\n\nAssistant: When you press Ctrl+Alt+Del and open the Task Manager, it sometimes unfreezes a frozen application because it interrupts the current process and forces the operating system to re-evaluate its priorities. Opening the Task Manager allocates some system resources to the Task Manager itself, which can cause the operating system to divert resources",

        "\n\nHuman: Why did North America never \u201csettle\u201d like Europe?\n\nPeoples lived in North America for tens of thousand of years, but North America - specifically southern Canada, coastal and Great Plains United States - never had cities like Europe did.\n\nWhy did Europe \u201csettle\u201d by c. 1000BCE while North America, didn\u2019t \u201csettle\u201d until c. 1500CE when Europeans arrived?\n\n(I am excluding Mexico from geographic North America for this question; I know/am under the assumption and educated guess that the Mayans, etc. didn\u2019t move north largely because of the vast expanse of desert from Central Mexico, north.)\n\nAssistant: There are several factors that contributed to the differences in the development of cities and settled civilizations in Europe compared to North America.\n\n1. Environmental factors: Europe had several environmental advantages that allowed for the development of settled societies. The continent had fertile soils, a temperate climate, and abundant water sources, which facilitated agriculture and the",
        "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when metals are heated up to a molten state they lose most or all of their magnetic characteristics, but the earths core is molten metal and it is what gives the Earth its magnetic field?\n\nA theory I heard about Mars is that its core cooled and thus the planet lost its magnetic field leading to its atmosphere degrading and surface water boiling away. How come this molten metal at the Earths core retains its magnetic properties instead of losing it due to not having a defined north and south pole for the magnetic field to form around?\n\nAssistant: The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the motion of molten metal in its outer core, which is primarily composed of iron and nickel. When these metals are heated to a molten state, they indeed lose their inherent magnetic properties. However, the Earth's magnetic field is not directly caused by the magnetic properties of these",
        "\n\nHuman: ow would you define libertarian and what are their beliefs (economically, socially, etc.)?\n\nAssistant: Libertarianism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual liberty, limited government intervention, and free market capitalism.

        "\n\nHuman: Generic brands of flash memory\n\nI'm sorry KomputerBay, I'm entirely unconvinced that you had anything to do with actually producing the memory in your CF card. So where does it comes from and why is it testing faster for so cheap? I get that it comes from one of the places that actually has a fab, but is this memory that failed tests and they don't want to put in their main brand? Any differences that the generic companies can really add to it on their own?\n\nAssistant: Generic brands of flash memory, such as KomputerBay, often source their memory components from the same manufacturers that produce memory for well-known brands. These manufacturers may have excess inventory, lower-grade memory that did not pass certain quality tests, or even memory from older production runs that are sold to generic brands at a lower cost",
        "\n\nHuman: why is there asymmetry in the veins of our limbs?\n\nI was looking at my particularly veiny feet the other day and the question dawned on me. I know we're not bilaterally symmetrical on the inside but the structure of our arms and legs are pretty much identical so why wouldn't our DNA just mirror the other side down to the cardiovascular system? \n\nP.s. Sorry if this is too advanced of a question for this sub, it's the first one that came to mind, feel free to ELIanundergradmedstudent if you can't simplify it\n\nAssistant: There is asymmetry in the veins of our limbs primarily because of the way our blood vessels develop during the embryonic stage. As our bodies grow and develop, the blood vessels form through a process called angiogenesis, which involves the branching and growth of new blood vessels from existing ones.\n\nThis process is not perfectly symmetrical",

Why is it still considered vodka if it's made out of potatoes or grain or even grapes?\n\nI'd always thought that vodka was made from potatoes, but I just finished a bottle of Divine Vodka and it's made from 100% grapes. A) it was awesome. B) why is that still considered vodka?\n\nFor that matter I also bought a bottle of bourbon made from grapes from the same vineyard. If both things are made from 100% grapes, what determines why one is \"bourbon\" and one is \"vodka\"?\n\nAssistant: Vodka is defined by its production process and characteristics, rather than the specific raw materials used to create it. Vodka can be made from various fermentable substances, such as potatoes, grains, or grapes. What makes it vodka is the distillation and filtration process that results in a clear, neutral spirit with a high",
        "\n\nHuman: why arent motorcycles front propelled?\n\nSeems much safer that way\n\nAssistant: Motorcycles are not front propelled for several reasons:\n\n1.

        "\n\nHuman: why can't bitcoins be cheated?\n\nI really don't understand how bitcoins are functional. First off, no country \"backs up\" the currency-- why does it have any value? More importantly... bitcoins are mined by conducting hash calculations on one's computer. Couldn't (even an amateur) computer scientist just readjust the amount of bitcoins they have? Bitcoin-qt is on one's desktop... if mining is just performing simple arithmetic, can't there be an easier way? I am really confused on how bitcoins are functional when there isn't a safe network that keeps track of every single bitcoin (and if there is why it cannot be infiltrated)\n\nThanks for much -- sorry if it's a dumb question.\n\nAssistant: Bitcoins cannot be cheated because they use a decentralized and highly secure technology called blockchain. Blockchain is a digital ledger that records all transactions made with bitcoins, and it is almost impossible to tamper with the data stored in it.\n\nThe value of bitcoins comes from the trust people have in the system and the limited supply of bitcoins",

        "\n\nHuman: Since Base 10 was just create due to the number of fingers on our hands, why are all of our senses logarithmic to a base of 10?\n\nMany scientists believe we began to use base 10 because it was easily countable on fingers, and 10 is not more special of a number than 11 or 9. Why then do our senses like hearing work in log base ten? I.E. in order to hear a sound that appears twice as loud, you need a sound that is 10 times louder.\n\nAssistant: Our senses are not inherently logarithmic to a base of 10; instead, they follow a logarithmic relationship due to the way our brain processes sensory information. The human body and brain have evolved to efficiently process and understand a wide range of sensory stimuli, such as light, sound, and touch. \n\nThe reason our",

        "\n\nHuman: Why can't someone just calm down when they are having a panic/anxiety attack?\n\nI know that telling someone to calm down in such a situation is useless, and it usually will just make it worse, but why?  Even if nobody tells them to do anything, why is it so seemingly impossible?  I ask because I've never really had a problem with anxiety; when I'm stressed I typically just begin feeling tired, so anxiety as a whole is pretty foreign to me.\n\nAssistant: During a panic or anxiety attack, the body is experiencing a strong physiological and psychological response to a perceived threat.

        "\n\nHuman: Why do modern touchscreens not have to be calibrated constantly like old ones did?\n\nI remember back on older stylus-type touchscreens such as a Nintendo DS, the screen would occasionally become out of calibration (you would touch one spot, and it would click a different point), and you would need to recalibrate the screen by touching specific points on the screen.\n\nWhy don't you have to do this on modern touchscreens like an iPhone, most tablets, etc.?\n\nI know that older touchscreens used actual touch sensors, while modern screens use some sort of electron sensor (which is why you can't use just anything as a stylus on an iPhone, like you could on a DS).  Does this have anything to do with it?  What makes the new system so much more reliable?\n\nThanks!  This just hit me earlier while my professor was teaching using a Surface, and I was remembering the old days of calibrating Smartboards and DS's.\n\nAssistant: Modern touchscreens do not require constant calibration like older ones because they use a different technology called capacitive touchscreens. Capacitive touchscreens rely on the electrical properties of the human body to detect touch inputs. They consist of a layer of glass coated with a transparent conductor, usually indium tin oxide (ITO). When a",

        "\n\nHuman: Why do some smells never go away from things?\n\nWhy is it that, even after years, some smells stick to surfaces (I've noticed it in plastic the most), not mattering how much or with what the surface gets cleaned? Example: a friend of mine gave me a glass jar that used to contain spices. The glass doesn't smell, but the plastic that seals the container smells like garlic, and I've tried absolutely everything to make it come off. Shouldn't the molecules that cause the smell run out or something?\n\nAssistant: Some smells never seem to go away from certain objects because the odor-causing molecules can penetrate and become trapped within porous materials, like plastic. These materials have tiny pores and spaces that can absorb and hold onto the odor-causing molecules, making them difficult to remove.\n\nAdditionally, some odors are caused by volatile organic compounds",

        "\n\nHuman: Americans and Credit Card Debt\n\nAs an European I don't really understand why so many Americans have such high credit card debt. What's the mentality behind that? You know that you have to pay it back and you know that a) you're living beyond your means and b) the future is uncertain. So why make debt? The only two reasons to make debt to me is a house and student loans. Maybe a car if you're really secure. Why don't people save up for things they want? Even if they have all the nice things they wished for, doesn't the debt make them unhappy?\n\nAssistant: There are several factors that contribute to the high credit card debt among Americans:\n\n1. Consumer culture: The United States has a strong consumer culture that encourages spending and consumption. This often leads people to buy things they may not necessarily need, which can result in accumulating debt.\n\n2. Easy access to credit: Credit cards are",

        "\n\nHuman: Inadmissible evidence in court\n\nHow do courts deal with inadmissible evidence? Do they just ignore it even if it can solve the case by itself?\n\nSay i'm accused of stealing a car. The prosecution cannot prove i did it until someone hacks my email and suddenly photos of the car parked in my garage emerge.\n\nCould the prosecution obtain an order to go check my house? Or could i argue that since there is no valid evidence, they would be infringing my rights?\n\nAssistant: Inadmissible evidence is any evidence that cannot be presented in court because it is not relevant, reliable, or was obtained through illegal or improper means. Courts are required to exclude inadmissible evidence from the trial proceedings, even if it might be highly probative or could potentially solve the case by itself.\n\nIn the example",

        "\n\nHuman: What was Italian food like in history before tomatoes were brought to Europe from the New World?\n\nI was astounded to learn the tomato originated in the \"New World\" and was not native to Italy. The tomato being the main ingredient of Italian food, I suppose I always assumed the tomato was mainly from Italy or that part of Europe.\n\nSo what was Italian food like before the tomato was imported? \n\nAlso, why did the tomato become so much more popular in Italy than any other country? It must have completely changed their entire culture of food, but no other country is primarily associated with the tomato like Italy. How?\n\nAssistant: Before the introduction of tomatoes, Italian cuisine relied on other ingredients and flavors. Some of the key ingredients in traditional Italian dishes included olive oil, garlic, cheese, fish, and various herbs such as basil, oregano, and rosemary.

        "\n\nHuman: Why do lions live in prides if cats in general are solitary animals?\n\nEDIT: Wow, was not expecting so many responses!\n\nThis is probably a separate question altogether, but every pride I've seen in a nature documentary has one male and a bunch of females. Does that mean that there a whole lot of single males roaming the savannah? Or do these males necessary get killed off by other dominant males? Seems like that would create a bit of a gene pool situation, no?\n\nAssistant: Lions live in prides mainly because it offers them several advantages in terms of hunting, mating, and protection. While most other cat species are solitary, lions have evolved to form social groups as a survival strategy in their specific environment. Living in prides allows them to hunt larger prey, take care of their young more",
        "\n\nHuman: Why isn't the motion of the Earth used to produce energy?\n\nMoving turbines, and moving windmills are used as source of enery. Couldn't the Earth's motion (around the sun, and through the universe in general) be used as a source of energy too?\n\nAssistant: The motion of the Earth can indeed be used as a source of energy, but not directly. The main reason is that in order to harness energy from a moving object, you need a relative difference in motion or a force to generate energy.\n\nFor example, wind turbines work because there's a difference in motion between the moving",

        "\n\nHuman: ELIA5: How exactly does a space craft change directions in space?\n\nSo if a space shuttle is traveling through space how does it slow down, speed up or change direction? Maybe I'm just being dumb but I was thinking if every action has an equal and opposite reaction then what is receiving the opposite energy needed to move the shuttle? I guess I'm thinking even if the engines are burning the fuel its not like the ship is pushing on anything how can the shuttle move?  What am I missing? Motion conserves momentum right? But fundamentally what are the thrusters pushing against to move the shuttle?\n\nAssistant: In space, there is no air or anything else to push against. Instead, a spacecraft changes its direction or speed by using its engines. When the engines fire, they burn fuel and create a force called \"thrust.\" This force pushes the spacecraft in the opposite direction of the engine's exhaust.\n\nImagine you're standing",

I don't think there is any way that the 7.99 monthly subscription fee for all users is anywhere near to covering that (and other shows like House of Cards and so on).\n\nHow on earth does Netflix get their money back and actually generate profit to create more original shows?  My dad is VERY curious - he finds Netflix very interesting and loves all the changes coming to media.  But this one thing I can't answer for him very well.\n\nAnyone have an answer?\n\nAssistant: Netflix generates profit from their original content through subscription fees paid by their users. By creating high-quality original content, they attract more subscribers and retain existing ones, thus increasing their revenue.

        "\n\nHuman: Why do cities and towns \"stagger\" stoplights so that no matter your timing you'll always be caught at a light?\n\nI'm from a mid-sized city and work in a suburb nearby. Every light in both areas is timed to cycle the opposite of the lights on either side of it, so there's no way to \"catch\" more than one light at a time as while one light is green, the next will be red. Is there a reason for this, or was it just really, really poor planning?\n\nAssistant: The main reason cities and towns \"stagger\" stoplights is to manage the flow of traffic and reduce congestion. This is known as traffic signal coordination or synchronization. By staggering the lights, they can prevent vehicles from speeding through multiple intersections, which can lead to accidents or congestion. It also encourages drivers to maintain a consistent",

        "\n\nHuman: Why do older people put \"the\" in front of things all the time?\n\nWhat I mean by this is how a lot of older people who usually don't understand something or don't want to understand something will put the word \"the\" in front of words that don't normally have it in there. Phrases like:\n\n\"Are you reading the Harry Potter?\"\n\"Look for that on the Google.\"\netc.\n\nIs it a cultural thing? Is that just how a lot of people talked when they were young? Is dropping the \"the\" a more modern thing to do?\n\nAssistant: This phenomenon is likely due to a combination of factors, including generational differences in language use and older people's unfamiliarity with certain contemporary technology or trends. \n\n1. Generational language differences: Language evolves over time, and older generations may have grown up using \"the\" before certain words or phrases more frequently than younger",

I think it isn't really cool energy wise so I want to know what's the best use of a computer, how often you should turn it off, considering both the computer's state and the energy used\n\nAssistant: Turning off electronic devices, especially computers, is important for several reasons:\n\n1. Energy conservation: Leaving computers and other electronic devices on constantly consumes energy, which not only increases your electricity bill but also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Turning off devices when not in use helps reduce energy consumption and is more environmentally friendly.\n\n2.",
        "\n\nHuman: Are angry and belligerent drunks just people who are angry inside, and their inhibitions are removed?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: It is possible that angry and belligerent drunks are individuals who have underlying anger issues, and alcohol consumption lowers their inhibitions, allowing these emotions to surface more easily. Alcohol can impair judgment, reduce self-control, and alter emotional responses, which may lead to aggressive or confrontational behavior in some individuals. However",
        "\n\nHuman: The criteria required for an organism to be a different species from other similar organisms and why there are many different variations in humans yet we're all the same species.\n\n[deleted]\n\nAssistant: In biology, the concept of species is based on the biological species concept, which defines a species as a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. This means that members of a species can mate and have offspring that can also reproduce successfully. Organisms that cannot do this are considered to be different species",
        "\n\nHuman: \"It's the amps which kill you not volts.\" But, wouldn't amps be always constant for given volt, as R=V/I. (Where R of human body is same)\n\nAssistant: It's true that current (amps) is the primary factor causing harm to the human body, rather than voltage. However, the statement \"amps would always be constant for a given voltage\" is not entirely accurate. The current flowing through the human body depends on both the voltage applied and the resistance of the human body.\n\n",
        "\n\nHuman: Why is dental care still so archaic?\n\nI went to the dentist this morning, and it got me thinking. Aside from imaging advancements and maybe some advancements in materials, they still basically just pick at your teeth with a hook, and polish them with a sandy, gritty paste. Why isn't there a coating that could be applied to adult teeth to protect them? Why isn't there a rinse or liquid that could do the cleaning for them?\n\nAssistant: Dental care may seem archaic in some aspects, but it has also made significant advancements in recent years. However, the reasons why some practices and treatments may still seem archaic include:\n\n1. Biological Complexity: The human mouth is a complex environment with diverse bacteria, varying pH levels, and constant exposure to different substances",
        "\n\nHuman: ow do power companies sense and locate a power outage?\n\nOr \"shortage\" for those in the UK. \n\nI don't think I've ever called in to report an outage, yet it gets fixed. I live in an area where there are very few permanent residents so there's a possibility that it never gets reported.\n\nSince the power companies don't make money unless the power is on, they have a way to find the specific point of failure, right? How does this work? \n\nI'm just sitting here in the dark wondering about this and a search didn't come up with much.\n\nAssistant: Power companies use various technologies and monitoring systems to sense and locate power outages. Some of the methods they use include:\n\n1. Smart Grid Technology: Modern power grids are equipped with sensors and communication systems that constantly monitor the flow of electricity. These sensors can detect when there is a sudden drop in voltage or current, indicating",
        "\n\nHuman: Why do scrapes and other injuries feel more painful when its cold outside?\n\nAssistant: When it is cold outside, the body responds by constricting blood vessels in the extremities to preserve core body temperature. This constriction, called vasoconstriction, can make nerves more sensitive, amplifying the pain signals. Additionally, cold temperatures can slow down the healing process, causing inflammation and stiffness around the",
        "\n\nHuman: The Euthyphro Dilemma\n\nThis question was asked a few years ago in this subreddit but the explanation didn't totally answer my questions. Basically, I understand that the Euthyphro Dilemma, stated very simply, is this: Does God decide what things are morally good? Or does God recognize certain things that are morally good and then relay that information to us? \n\nFirst question: Am I right in making this simplification?\n\nMy second question is, how exactly does this dilemma present a problem to the Christian concept of an omniscient, omnipresent God?\n\nAssistant: Your simplification is mostly correct. The Euthyphro Dilemma, which originates from Plato's dialogue \"Euthyphro,\" is indeed a question about the nature of morality and its relationship with God. It can be stated as: \"Is something morally good because God commands it, or does God",

        "\n\nHuman: Why can't scientists send an empty, satellite controlled submarine with cameras into the Bermuda Triangle and discover it's mystery? Also, how far are we from discovering it's secrets?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Scientists have not sent a satellite-controlled submarine with cameras into the Bermuda Triangle primarily because the Bermuda Triangle is not considered a real scientific mystery. The Bermuda Triangle is a region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean where some ships and aircraft have allegedly disappeared under mysterious circumstances. However, most of these disappearances can be attributed",
        "\n\nHuman: Why is the currency is some countries that are generally considered to have poorer economic standing more \"powerful\" than more wealthy countries?\n\nFor instance, for every 1 Euro, you receive approx. 21,66 Mexican Pesos. \n\nFor every 1 Euro, you receive approx. 124,40 Japanese Yen.\n\nJapan has roughly triple the GDP of Mexico. What am I missing?\n\nAssistant: The value of a currency does not necessarily reflect the economic strength of a country. The exchange rate of a currency is determined by various factors such as interest rates, inflation, political stability, and economic performance. While Japan has a higher GDP than Mexico, the value of the Japanese Yen (JPY) is lower than",

And why are there seven colours? There's six primary and secondary colours, not seven.\n\nAssistant: The colours of the rainbow are a result of the dispersion of light. When white light (such as sunlight) passes through a prism or water droplets in the atmosphere, it is split into its different wavelengths, which we perceive as different colours. This phenomenon is known as dispersion, and the sequence of colours produced is called",
        "\n\nHuman: When a surgery is very long (over 12 hours) how do the surgeons and nurses rotate and how do they tell each other what has been done so far?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: In long surgeries, surgeons and nurses often work in shifts, with a team rotation strategy in place. This ensures that everyone gets breaks to rest, eat, and stay sharp during the procedure. \n\nBefore a long surgery, the surgical team will typically have a detailed plan, including the anticipated steps of the procedure, the roles",
        "\n\nHuman: ow does real colour get converted to black and white, and can it be reversed?\n\nThe way I see it, say you have an old black and white film camera. Light comes in at a bunch of frequencies which correspond to assorted colours which are each mapped to a set of black/white/grey colours on the film. Firstly I'd like to know simply how this process works.\n\nSecondly, seeing as, say, a particular shade of red stays the same colour (within uncertainty) in monochrome, and that since our ability to precisely analyse the colour on the film is significantly better now than at the time these devices were common, would it be possible to figure out or extrapolate the colour of the original object on the film and then recolour the output?\n\nAssistant: When real color is converted to black and white, it is done through a process called desaturation, which essentially removes the color information and leaves only the luminance (brightness) values. In the case of an old black and white film camera, this process happens chemically. The film emulsion is sensitive to the",

Legal reasons: Companies need to be careful about making false or misleading claims about their competitors. Comparing their products or services to a generic \"competitor\" or \"bargain brand\" can help avoid potential legal issues.",

For example why did Einstein develop a passion for Mathematics? How did Mozart fall in love with music? And how/why did Vincent van Gogh, Leonardo da Vinci and Picasso pursue art with such tremendous enthusiasm? Athletes, artists, scientists and people who are extremely excited about making sweet, multi-coloured rice have a thing in common. And I want to know how that thing known to some as \"passion\", is discovered, pursued and mastered with such grit that it encompasses a large part of their life.\n\nAssistant: Developing a passion for something typically involves a combination of factors, including personal interests, natural talent, exposure to the subject, and perseverance in pursuing it.

        "\n\nHuman: ow do EMTs and paramedics balance confidentiality and appropriate care for transgender patients?\n\nI'm pretty interested in emergency medicine/possibly becoming an EMT, and this is kind of a burning question I have: what does an EMT or paramedic do about confidentiality for a transgender patient, especially if the patient's problem might be/is related to their biological sex? Is it unethical to reveal a transgender patient's biological sex/status as a transgender person over the radio or to doctors, even if the patient, for example, is a trans man who might have an ectopic pregnancy? Are there protocols for this kind of thing?\n\nAssistant: EMTs and paramedics are expected to maintain patient confidentiality and respect their patients' privacy, including for transgender patients. However, the primary concern for medical professionals is always providing appropriate and necessary care. If a patient's biological sex is relevant to their medical emergency, it may be necessary to disclose that information to ensure the patient",

        "\n\nHuman: ow (or why) the U.S. government can pick what state laws it wants to allow and not?\n\nFor example, The DoJ will sue Texas over it's voter ID laws, even though Texas passed it, and then grant immunity to colorado for legalize pot, even though it is still federally illegal. I'm not as much concerned about the issues themselves, just the methods the Federals use for deciding which particular laws they will allow. \nThanks be to any help!\n\nAssistant: The U.S. government can pick which state laws it wants to allow and not primarily due to the Supremacy Clause in the U.S. Constitution, which states that federal law is the \"supreme law of the land\" and takes precedence over state laws when there is a conflict. This means that if a state",
        "\n\nHuman: When film earnings are being calculated, especially big releases that break all sorts of \"biggest opening weekend\" and such, is inflation taken into account when comparing these numbers to older films?\n\nWith cinema ticket prices being more than they were 10-20 years ago etc. does this effect the final numbers?\n\nAssistant: When comparing film earnings, inflation is often not taken into account for the initial headlines and reports about a movie's performance. The focus is usually on the raw box office numbers, which can be misleading due to rising ticket prices over time. However, when making more in-depth comparisons or analyzing a film's historical performance, inflation",
        "\n\nHuman: ow is thousand year old water drinkable?\n\nI drink bottled mineral water daily.\n\nThe label on the bottle says the water is five thousand years old.\n\nThis claim is validated by a note on the company website: \"We have carried out detailed isotope studies in conjunction with the British Geological Survey that showed that the water originated from meteoric waters (like rainfall) at the end of the last ice-age in the Palaeozoic era, about 5,000 years ago.\"\n\nHow is water so old still drinkable? \n\nAnd how comes it wouldn't have evaporated a long time ago?\n\nAssistant: Thousand-year-old water can still be drinkable if it has been stored in a protected and isolated environment, such as deep underground aquifers. In these conditions, the water can remain uncontaminated and free from harmful bacteria or pollutants. The age of the water does not necessarily impact its drinkability, as long as",
        "\n\nHuman: Why are the last seats on a school bus smaller than all of the others?\n\nAssistant: The last seats on a school bus are often smaller than the others due to the design and construction of the bus.

        "\n\nHuman: Why do cars get better gas mileage on \"highway miles\" rather than \"city/town miles\"?\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: Cars get better gas mileage on highway miles rather than city/town miles for several reasons:\n\n1. Constant speed: On highways, vehicles tend to maintain a constant speed, which allows the engine to operate more efficiently. In city driving, the constant starting and stopping requires more energy, which consumes more fuel.\n\n2. Lower",

In this model, the universe undergoes a series of expansions and contractions, making it infinitely old.\n\nIn L",
