So PLEASE don't remove my question, just explain like I'm five.\n\nI've searched the internet far and wide for an explanation that can make it into my tiny brain, but I can't seem to figure out how this whole 'ground' thing works. Say if you're building a PC and need to ground yourself, why is the case or the power supply the ground? If you keep touching the ground, won't the electrons just build up in it and stop being ground? Does ground have 0 charge? Why then/how does ground have 0 charge, how is that possible? I've read that the ground connects with the 'Earth', but no one explains what that means. If it connects with the 'Earth', where does the charge go from the case/PSU to do that? The part you touch to ground yourself isn't connected to the outlet is it? Wouldn't it shock you? The case definitely isn't connected to an outlet, so why is it ground???\n\nAssistant: Electrical ground is a way to safely discharge excess electrical charge. Think of it like a pressure valve on a boiler - when the pressure gets too high, the valve opens and releases some of the pressure so that the boiler doesn't explode. Similarly, in an electrical circuit, if there is too much charge built up,", "\n\nHuman: Genetically speaking, how can a beard have brown, blonde, and red hairs?\n\nAssistant: A beard can have brown, blonde, and red hairs due to genetic variation.

How come? Are the vitamins in the pills not guaranteed to be fully absorbed into the body? Is there some sort of mechanism that is missing? Is the disclaimer referring to the other nutrients that aren't offered in the pills? Are they just legally covering their asses?\n\nIf I take pills which promise 100% of my calcium RDA, am I not actually getting my calcium RDA?\n\nAssistant: Vitamin supplements cannot be used as substitutes for a balanced and healthy diet because they do not provide all the necessary nutrients and benefits that whole foods do. While they may contain the recommended daily allowance of certain vitamins and minerals, they do not offer the same synergistic effects that whole foods do. Additionally, some nutrients are better", "\n\nHuman: What happens to hybrid car batteries when they are replaced?\n\nI'm assuming that hybrid cars that use batteries, such as Tesla, eventually need to be replaced like any other battery.  What happens to the old batteries once they are replaced?  I also assume they are 'recycled' but what does that mean exactly?  Surely some waste ends up rotting in a landfill?\n\nAssistant: Hybrid car batteries are typically made up of a combination of materials, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and aluminum. When these batteries are replaced, they are usually recycled to recover these valuable materials.\n\nThe recycling process involves breaking down the battery into its component parts, separating out the different materials, and then processing them", "\n\nHuman: ELI5: Why does cough continues after the cold is over?\n\nAssistant: Coughing is a reflex that helps clear the airways of mucus, irritants, and foreign particles.

They come in every morning if they've been out, and but usually stay inside all night and most of the day. Sometimes they don't go out at all, and spend what must be close to 24 hours sleeping, shifting nap spots, and sleeping more.\n\nHow is it that they can still run aound and do cat shit when they barely excercise, let alone not be morbidly (or even slightly) obese?\n\nAssistant: Cats are naturally designed to conserve energy, which means they can sleep for long periods of time without losing muscle mass or experiencing any negative side effects. This is because their bodies are very efficient at using the nutrients they consume to maintain their muscle mass and overall health, even when they are not being very active.\n\nIn addition", "\n\nHuman: Fact-check each of the claims in the following answer.\n\nQuestion: Why do we stop crying automatically from physical pain as we grow older?\n\nAnswer: Although it is difficult to determine exactly why we stop crying automatically from physical pain as we grow older, it is probably because we become less vulnerable as we age and gain experience handling pain. We also learn to control our emotions, which consequently reduces the urge to cry about something physical. Additionally, it is possible that our brain matures to the point where it is no longer as reactive to pain stimuli as it was when we were children.\n\nAssistant: Claim 1: \"it is difficult to determine exactly why we stop crying automatically from physical pain as we grow older\"\nThis claim is true. There is no consensus on why we stop crying automatically from physical pain as we grow older.\n\nClaim 2: \"it is probably because we become less vulnerable as we age and", "\n\nHuman: why is a 4k or ultrawide monitor considerably more expensive than a much larger 4k tv?\n\nI've recently been looking for a new monitor for my pc, and I've been looking at either a ultrawide display or possibly a 4k display around the 30\" mark (as my current monitor is 1080p 30\" widescreen and I'mnot a fan of sitting only a desk width away from 40inch +), but when looking i realised that for considerably less than i could find either of those options i could get a 40 inch+ 4k tv, why is that? Surely if i want a smaller 4k display or even a smaller non 4k display like an ultrawide it should be less than a much larger 4k tv?\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons why a 4K or ultrawide monitor may be more expensive than a larger 4K TV:\n\n1. Higher pixel density: Monitors generally have a higher pixel density than TVs, meaning they can display more pixels per inch.

This creates a vacuum, which causes the air to", "\n\nHuman: Why does a horse\u2019s gallop seem to be on a three count instead of a four count given they have four legs?\n\nAssistant: The reason a horse's gallop appears to be on a three count instead of a four count is due to the way their legs move during the galloping motion. When a horse gallops, their front legs hit the ground first, followed by their hind legs hitting the ground together. This creates a three-beat", "\n\nHuman: Fact-check each of the claims in the following answer.\n\nQuestion: Why are so many people allergic to soy and peanuts, but no other legumes?\n\nAnswer: It is still unknown why soy and peanuts are often the foods that cause the most allergic reactions. There are some theories, but the exact reason is not known. Some people think that with all the processing that soy and peanuts undergo when they are produced or eaten, their proteins or other components become easier to detect by the immune system. This makes some people's bodies become sensitised to these foods, causing an allergic reaction when they eat them. Unfortunately, allergies to soy or peanuts can be life-long and are not always predictable.\n\nAssistant: Claim 1: Soy and peanuts are often the foods that cause the most allergic reactions.\nFact-check: This claim is partially true. Soy and peanuts are among the top eight food allergens in the United States, along with milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, and wheat.

So in other words, the fewer unbound AD receptors there are, the more drowsy you are likely to become until your next sleep cycle wipes the slate clean and resets those receptors.\n\nAssuming my understanding of this mechanism is correct, how does caffeine manage to bring you back from already feeling tired or drowsy? My understanding would be that all it can do adenosine-wise is to block / antagonise existing unoccupied receptors - it cannot retroactively \"bump\" adenosine out of the way and antagonise a receptor which has already bound to adenosine. So hypothetically, if one had 50 adenosine receptors and 48 of them were already bound to adenosine, you'd be feeling fairly exhausted already and would be pretty close to crashing. All caffeine can do is to make sure the last two receptors cannot be bound, for the time being - it cannot reverse the binding of adenosine to the already-bound 48 receptors.\n\nThis suggests to me that all it should be able to do is arrest the progress of drowsiness - not reverse it. So if you're already on the verge of falling asleep, it shouldn't be able to pull you back from that, just keep you suspended where you already are on the \"sleepiness scale\".\n\nWhat am I missing here? I have clearly misunderstood something, as we all know a decent cup of coffee or a can of red bull is perfectly capable of jolting us awake even if we were on the brink of unavoidable sleepy time. Is dopamine a stronger stimulant than adenosine is a depressant? Does the dopamine release caused by caffeine offset the fact that you already have enough bound adenosine receptors to signal the brain to start yawning and making for bed? \n\nOr am I fundamentally misunderstanding the whole caffeine - adenosine - sleep axis to begin with?\n\nAssistant: You have a good understanding of the basic mechanism of how caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors, but there are a few additional factors at play that can help explain how it can reverse sleepiness.\n\nFirstly, caffeine not only blocks adenosine receptors but also stimulates the release of other neurotransmitters like dopamine and n", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that when microwaving something that dried up, like hotdog buns that have been in the fridge or a cookie that's a day old, seem to make it soft and damp again?\n\nAssistant: Microwaving works by transferring heat to the water molecules in the food, causing them to vibrate and create heat.

I just recently found this comment on a picture on *Danbooru* of all things, and it made me ask my question to you guys here because... I don't understand anything that he is meaning.\n\nSo basically, someone in the comment section claimed that we live in a much different time than the Cold War and that soldiers aren't kept in isolation.\n\nThis person claimed otherwise, and this is what he wrote:\n\n\"**They absolutely do keep soldiers in underground bunkers and give them constant readiness tests to see that they are ready and willing to nuke the world at a moment's notice with no difference from how they were trained in the 60's. (They even use the same, ludicrously obsolete, equipment.)**\n\n**In fact, things are even more ludicrously risky than before, as the knowledge of how obsolete they are has drained morale from the units. There have been repeated scandals involving cheating on tests about safety precautions, as well as findings of rampant drug abuse. The nuclear arms are in the hands of people who are coked up and ready to shoot at anything, regardless of knowing what button actually aims the missile.**\n\n**You may think it's been forgotten and that things must have surely changed, but that doesn't make it so.**\"\n\nThis may sound stupid, but I really don't know what he's actually talking about. What \"obsolete equipment\" does he even mean? Are soldiers really trained to be basically insane as he claims? I would really like to know. Because I'm not sure if the US military actually IS insane...\n\nFurthermore, he also posted another comment earlier in response to someone else claiming that there's always \"a human trigger puller at the end that could defy the orders\", which is as follows:\n\n\"**A human that is selected and trained to unquestioningly follow those orders because in the event of a real nuclear attack, there are only 4 minutes to respond. They don't have time to inform the entire chain of command, they are ordered to assume the people above them know what they are doing.**\"\n\nThis may be a different matter, but it does have a lot to do with that first comment I cited. I realize my request doesn't seem like something for this ELI5 subreddit, but I'm the kind of guy who appreciates coherent explanations as opposed to short unhelpful responses... so this is why I came here.\n\nAnd thus, I would really appreciate an explanation to this... because I sure as hell don't know any better.\n\nThanks in advantage though.\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I cannot confirm the accuracy of the claims made in the comments you cited.

Is it that people with big money will support candidates during election season so they get elected, and in turn the politician push policies that benefit the rich?\n\nAssistant: Yes, that's one way politicians can be \"bought\" by corporations. Here are some other ways:\n\n1. Campaign contributions: Corporations and wealthy individuals can donate large sums of money to politicians' campaigns, which can sway their decisions and votes in favor of the donors' interests.\n\n2. Lobbying: Corpor", "\n\nHuman: Why aren't modern refrigerator / freezers made to be vacuum sealed if things only spoil with oxygen?\n\nWouldn't it save a lot of energy too if there was only a very small section cooling things that you desire to be cool like particular produce, cold dishes and beverages, with everything else in the larger space simply preserved at room temperature? Then the only power used otherwise would be the vacuum process every time you opened and closed the door. \n\nOr would all our food explode?\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons why modern refrigerator/freezers are not vacuum sealed:\n\n1. Cost: Vacuum sealing requires additional components and technology, which would increase the cost of the refrigerator/freezer.\n\n2. Practicality: Vacuum sealing would make it more difficult to access and organize the contents of the refrigerator/freezer, as everything", "\n\nHuman: Independent component analysis vs. Fourier Analysis\n\nFrom what I've read about ICA, it allows you to isolate/extract a particular signal (PS) from a given signal (GS). GS is some linear combination of \"base signals\" (BS). \n\nThis all sounds kind of like fourier analysis. In fourier analysis, you can figure out which frequencies are present in a given signal. \n\nSo what is the difference between the two and when would you use one vs. the other?\n\nThanks! :-)\n\nBackground: familiar with fourier analysis, but not as much with statistics. I have taken basic statistics for engineering (statistical distributions, error analysis, ANOVA) but nothing more than that.\n\nAssistant: Fourier analysis and independent component analysis (ICA) are both used to analyze signals, but they are fundamentally different techniques.\n\nFourier analysis decomposes a signal into its constituent frequencies, which are represented as sine and cosine waves. This allows you to identify the frequencies that make up a signal and their magnitudes. Fourier analysis", "\n\nHuman: If your body repairs it's self better while you sleep, then why not put people to sleep for a few days after surgery or treatment after a disease?\n\nAssistant: While it is true that the body repairs itself during sleep, putting someone to sleep for a few days after surgery or treatment is not practical or safe. Anesthesia carries risks, including complications such as respiratory distress, heart problems, and allergic reactions.

After the war the Allies created the Maginot Line to prevent further aggression from Germany but when the Second World War started the Nazis did basically the same thing and went through Belgium.... again. \n\nAm I missing something about what had happened here?\n\nAssistant: The Allies expected the Maginot Line to work because it was a massive defensive fortification that spanned the French-German border and was built with advanced technology and military strategy. It was designed to be impenetrable and prevent any kind of surprise attack by the Germans. Additionally, the French military had a strong", "\n\nHuman: ow does learning a new language by immersion work?\n\nI wanna take about 4 semesters of Italian and then study abroad probably in Venice, but I knew that some people learn a different language just by becoming exposed to the language in the country itself. How does immersion work?\n\nAssistant: Immersion is a language learning technique that involves surrounding oneself with the language being learned in real-life situations. This means being in a country where the language is spoken and engaging with native speakers, whether it's through conversation, reading, writing, or listening. \n\nThe idea behind immersion is that by being exposed to the language", "\n\nHuman: [Psychological] Why do children love screaming when they play?\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide information based on research and studies.\n\nChildren often enjoy screaming when they play because it is a way for them to release their energy and express their excitement. It can also be a way for them to communicate with their playmates and", "\n\nHuman: Why do we create names for infinite/technically non-existent numbers if they're not practical for calculating anything in the real world?\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions, but I can provide some information. \n\nCreating names for infinite or technically non-existent numbers is not necessarily about practicality for real-world calculations.

Just for some people wondering, I don't go stare into the sun all day with one eye closed haha, I was always just curious as to why this sensation occurred when it was a bright day out.\n\nAssistant: Closing one eye reduces the amount of light that enters the eye, making it easier to look at a very bright object. When both eyes are open, they work together to form a single image in the brain, and the amount of light that enters each eye is balanced. However, when one eye is closed, the amount", "\n\nHuman: ow do we get Vitamin D from sun?\n\nFor instance, sitting out in cold weather with just your face exposed to sunlight, Is it different from getting a tan at the beach? I mean there must be some surface area exposure related stuff but what about its requirements over the different parts of body? How long one has to sit with less body exposure compared to more considering the above situations?\n\nAssistant: Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin when it is exposed to UVB radiation from the sun. The amount of Vitamin D produced depends on a number of factors, including the time of day, season, latitude, altitude, and the amount of skin exposed to the sun.\n\nWhen you sit out in cold weather with just", "\n\nHuman: Why my computer was so brilliantly fast when I first purchased it is now intolerably slow after only a few months of use.\n\nProgram load times, time it takes to start up ect. I know if I reinstall windows it'll work like a charm, but what is it about that process that makes my computer faster?\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons why your computer may have become slower over time:\n\n1.

(I.e cereal for breakfast not lunch) Is there any nutritional reason or something?\n\nAssistant: Yes, there are several reasons why we eat certain foods at specific times of the day:\n\n1. Breakfast: Eating breakfast is important to kickstart your metabolism and give your body the energy it needs to start the day. Cereal is a popular choice because it is easy to prepare and often fortified with vitamins and minerals.\n\n", "\n\nHuman: Does eating late make you fat? Why do so many people say it makes you fat?\n\nIn Eastern Europe, especially, I hear that eating late makes you fat.\n\nAssistant: There is no scientific evidence that suggests eating late at night will cause you to gain weight. However, if you eat more calories than your body needs throughout the day, it can lead to weight gain, regardless of when you eat those calories.\n\nThe reason why many people believe that eating late at night can cause weight gain is", "\n\nHuman: Explain: EL5: imputed income.\n\nI'm getting 4 cents as imputed income. I'm in management.\n\nAssistant: Imputed income refers to the estimated value of non-cash benefits provided by an employer to an employee, such as health insurance, housing or company car. In this case, it appears that the employee is receiving a very small amount of imputed income, possibly from a minor benefit such as a small discount or perk.", "\n\nHuman: If heat rises why does it get colder as you go up in the atmosphere?\n\nIf heat rises why does it snow on mountain tops? Does it stop rising at some point? If so when and how does it start getting cold again?\n\nAssistant: Heat does rise, but the atmosphere is a complex system with many factors at play. As you go up in the atmosphere, air pressure decreases and the air becomes less dense. Less dense air means fewer air molecules, which means there is less heat energy to transfer between them. This results in a drop in temperature as you", "\n\nHuman: Why is considered horrible to kill a person who is in extreme suffering?\n\nOn a school trip I went on we visited the site of a civil war battle. We had a tour guide who lead us through a house that was used as a hospital and told us about the battle. In one of the rooms we stopped and the tour guide explained the story behind huge blood stain on the floor. A soldier had lost both of his legs when he was hit by a cannon and was dragged up to the room. The other soldiers left him in the room bleeding out with his entrails hanging out. We had previously been told that there was a chloroform of sort that the nurses used on soldiers so that they could be operated on. While my question could have been phrased better I asked \"why didn't they kill him to put him out of his misery?\". Or they could have at least used the chloroform to knock him out but instead they let him bleed out while listening to his screams. The answer my teacher gave me is \"because we are human\". So why is it considered wrong to put a person out of their misery the way we do to animals?\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons why it is considered wrong to kill a person who is in extreme suffering:\n\n1. Respect for life: Human life is considered valuable and precious, and taking someone's life, even if it is to end their suffering, is seen as a violation of that value.\n\n2. Legal and ethical considerations:", "\n\nHuman: what is the evolutionary purpose of nipples becoming erect in the cold?\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs or values, but I can provide scientific explanations based on research. \n\nThe evolutionary purpose of nipples becoming erect in the cold is to reduce heat loss. When the body is exposed to cold temperatures, the muscles around the nipples contract, causing them to stand up and", "\n\nHuman: Why does a basic, minimalistic smiley look genuinely happy, when mouths on human smiles are barely curved at all and are often recognized from other facial features not present in a smiley?\n\nSometimes a smile doesn't have any curvature at all. [Example](http://www.obekti.bg/images/stories/articles/14241/o.jpg)\n\nAssistant: The reason why a basic, minimalistic smiley looks genuinely happy is due to the power of cultural conditioning and familiarity. We have been exposed to smileys since childhood, and they have become a universal symbol of happiness and positivity. Our brains have learned to associate the simple curved line and dots with a smile, and therefore", "\n\nHuman: do we sweat while we take hot showers?\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I do not have a physical body to sweat. However, humans do sweat while taking hot showers because the high temperature of the water causes the body to increase its internal temperature, triggering the sweat glands to produce sweat to cool down the body.", "\n\nHuman: ow can photons actually be massless?\n\nAs far as I've always know, the fact that something has energy of any kind means it must have mass to actually...express that energy?  Not really sure how to put it, but I just don't quite understand how something that seems to be pure energy can also be quantifiable, as in the ability to understand that photons as a particle exist (I do know of the dichotomy of the wave/particle aspect but that means that they do indeed exist as particles at some point, right?).\n\nAssistant: This is a great question! While it is true that energy and mass are related, they are not the same thing. Mass is a property of matter that determines how it interacts with other matter through gravity and other forces. Energy, on the other hand, is a property of matter and radiation that can be transferred or transformed", "\n\nHuman: what makes a person's throat hurt when they have a cold/the flu?\n\nI currently have a cold, but I don't understand how a running nose and coughing are related to my throat.\n\nAssistant: When a person has a cold or the flu, it is caused by a viral infection that affects the respiratory system.

I understand the very basic (ie an IRA vs employer-sponsored plan) but the finer details mess me up. I really need this job so I don't mind sounding stupid on the internet. \n\nSo reddit, in layman's terms, what are the features of traditional IRAs vs Roth IRAs, and 401k vs 403b? \n\nThese are the main ones I'm worried about, but any other input would be appreciated. I'm reading [this thread right now](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/loen1/eli5_how_does_a_roth_ira_work/) on Roth IRAs but I would still like additional help. That's how new at this I am. Thanks!\n\nAssistant: Traditional IRAs are individual retirement accounts that allow individuals to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Contributions to traditional IRAs are tax-deductible, and the account grows tax-free until retirement when withdrawals are taxed as regular income. Roth IRAs, on the other hand, are funded with after-tax dollars", "\n\nHuman: What will ''Internet Censorship'' actually mean? Is it going to happen? How will it affect me?\n\nAs I understand it, the Internet is censored to a certain extent, and for certain things, it should be.  How is it going to be possible to censor the Internet?  Are we going to end up with China-like restricted access?  Simple explanation please!\n\nAssistant: Internet censorship refers to the practice of controlling or restricting access to certain websites, content, or services on the internet.

First, the funding may not be well-targeted. For example, it might be allocated to low-performing or struggling schools rather than those that are already successful in helping students overcome poverty. Second, strong relationships between schools and communities are required to promote effective change, but this type of relationship cannot be forced. Lastly, complex factors lead to poverty - including housing issues, family behaviors, and community dynamics - and can be hard to address in schools.\n\nAssistant: Claim 1: U.S. Title 1 schools always seem to remain poor despite receiving additional funding. \n\nThis claim is not entirely true. While some Title 1 schools may struggle financially even after receiving additional funding, it is not accurate to say that all Title 1 schools always remain poor despite the extra funds.", "\n\nHuman: why do hornets/wasps nest use hexagons?\n\nEveryone knows why bees uses hexagons, but wasps and hornets also use them too, is it for the same purposes?\n\nAssistant: Yes, wasps and hornets use hexagons for the same reason as bees - to efficiently use space and maximize storage capacity within their nests.

Lack of standardization: Unlike PCs, which have standardized components and interfaces, smartphones have a wide range of components that are not interchangeable. Each phone model has its own unique components, making it difficult for consumers to mix and match", "\n\nHuman: s the physiological damage caused by trauma been the same through out history?\n\nI hear many stories of people being raped or kidnapped and tortured and the person suffers physiological damaged for years, possibly for life. However, in the past rape and torture and all manors of horrible harm were infected on people on a routine basis. Was nearly everyone in the past emotionally and physiologically damaged from the struggle of day to day life, or does our modern soft life make us more susceptible to physiological and emotional pain?\n\nAssistant: It is difficult to compare the physiological damage caused by trauma throughout history as there are many factors that could influence the severity and impact of trauma on individuals. For example, in the past, there may have been less awareness and understanding of trauma and mental health, and thus less support and resources available to individuals who experienced trauma.", "\n\nHuman: Why non-veterans and military get off from work ( &  school?) on Veteran's Day.\n\nI mean, it's not like they sacrificed their sense of self for the cause their country deemed good enough to send them into the fray.\n\nEDIT: meant non-military, not military.\n\nAssistant: Non-military individuals typically get off from work and school on Veteran's Day as a way to honor and recognize the sacrifices that veterans have made for their country.

Anti-union legislation: Over", "\n\nHuman: Can someone explain LI5 how electricity runs through water and when it's dangerous?\n\nIt's an odd question I know, but the reason I'm asking is because of a recent experience I've had that made me wonder.\n\nTwo days ago during a massive storm the first floor of our office was flooded, about 10-15 inches of water EVERYWHERE. We were all in front trying to block the water coming in, and then I remembered about the computers in the back rooms. They all had power extension cords lying on the ground.\n\nWhen I went to the rooms the computers, screens, printers and everything else that was plugged in was still working while the extension cords were submerged into water. I freaked out when I saw the red LED on/off button underwater so I went and unplugged each of them from the main outlets. 3 in total were totally submerged.\n\nSo then the question that obviously stuck with me was why weren't we all zapped? (we were all barefoot in ankle high water). \n\nFrom what I can guess happened, we were lucky that each cord had something connected and drawing power from the outlet AND that something wasn't also submerged in water. \n\nAm I correct in this? How does it work? and then also does this mean it's 'safe' to throw a power strip in a swimming pool if it's charging a phone on the side of the pool? Stupid example, I know, but I'm honestly just trying to understand in what situation electricity+water is dangerous and why it becomes so.\n\nAssistant: Electricity runs through water because water is a conductor of electricity, which means it allows electricity to flow through it. When electricity flows through water, it can be dangerous because it can shock or electrocute people who come into contact with it. \n\nHowever, in your situation, it's likely that the extension cords and", "\n\nHuman: Why is gold used in electronics more than silver?\n\nAssistant: Gold is used in electronics more than silver because of its superior properties.

This allowed for the development of commercial ISPs in the", "\n\nHuman: Why did the Jews not convert to Christianity like all of the \"pagans\" in Europe?\n\nFirst of all, I know that some Jews actually did convert to Christianity. I also know that Judaism has and had historically a well-developed culture and sense of community (even their own languages) that would keep them bound together.\n\nBut the thing is that there are *zero* Greco-Roman, Slavic, Romuva, Celtic, etc. pagans still around (except for a very few modern descendents of Christians who converted back in the 20th century). These people made up vastly greater proportions of the population than did the Jews, and they surely had their own culture, sense of community, and languages that would keep them bound together. Yet all of them converted, either of their own volition or by force, while the Jews did not convert or otherwise were not forced to.\n\nSo how did a large Jewish community manage to hang around until the 20th century to establish its own state, while at the same time we do not see any significant community of \"pagans\" doing the same thing, even though there were many more pagans than Jews?\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons why Jews did not convert to Christianity like other pagan groups in Europe:\n\n1. The Jewish faith has a strong emphasis on monotheism and the belief in one God, which was in direct conflict with the polytheistic beliefs of the pagan groups. This fundamental difference in belief made it difficult for", "\n\nHuman: Why is a lower heart rate indicative of better health?\n\nObviously I know it can mean bad things too but I know that athletes and fit people in general have lower heart rates.\n\nAssistant: A lower heart rate can be indicative of better health because it means that the heart is able to pump blood more efficiently.

So for a man, the ovaries drop and become the testes and the clitoris grows out to become the penis.\nSo my question was along the lines of genital placement. If the clitoris grows out to become the head of the penis, does that mean the base of the penis is where the clitoris would be ? and you do not urinate out of your clitoris but below it, and males urinate out of the end of their penis (Which would have previously been the clitoral head). So would someone who knows a little more be able to explain this to me.\nThank you very much :)\n\nAssistant: Yes, you are correct in your understanding that the clitoris and penis have similar embryonic origins. During fetal development, the genital tubercle (which will become either the penis or clitoris) is located in the same position in both male and female fetuses. As the fetus develops into either male or female,", "\n\nHuman: What is permanent shadow? How is it formed?\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions.

However, in order to unify the Roman Empire, Constantine began a campaign of promoting Christianity as the official religion, and this effort continued under his successors. As such, Constantine (and his successors) may be credited with some degree of \"standardizing\" the Christian Bible, as it has come down to us today.\n\nAssistant: The first claim is true - one cannot say that Emperor Constantine changed the Bible. \n\nThe second claim is also true - Constantine began a campaign of promoting Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire. \n\nThe third claim is partially true - Constantine may be credited with some degree of \"standardizing\" the", "\n\nHuman: Why is pornography in America taboo, yet erotica novels like 50 Shades of Grey are socially acceptable?\n\nEdit: I mean this to say that most pornography is regarded in America to be something that shouldn't be discussed in the open; it's something that ought to only be discussed in private. Not only is that true, but there's also the reoccurring mentality that actors in porn are \"lowly\" in some way (i.e. they were probably raped, they're not smart enough to do anything else, etc.).\n\nCompare that to erotica, which is sold in book stores and other shopping centers all throughout America (whereas porn has its own stores). Plus there's the fact that erotica will occasionally do so well that it gets its own movie deal (re: 50 Shades). I mean, when's the last time you heard of some kind of a porn plot getting greenlighted by hollywood to get produced into a full movie?\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons why pornography is generally considered taboo in America while erotica novels like 50 Shades of Grey are more socially acceptable:\n\n1. The medium: Pornography is typically viewed as a visual medium, while erotica is usually written. There is a long-standing cultural taboo against discussing sexual matters openly in America, and", "\n\nHuman: Why is it that sound seems to travel farther in cold weather?\n\nAssistant: Sound travels faster in colder air because the molecules in the air are closer together, which allows sound waves to propagate more efficiently.

They show a rail-gun firing multiple shots and after each there is a large cloud of smoke. What causes this? Is it condensation from water vapor in the air? Is it heat transfer from the round?\n\nAssistant: The smoke seen after firing a rail-gun is primarily caused by the extreme heating of the air and the vaporization of any material on the rails of the gun. The rail-gun fires a projectile at extremely high speeds, which generates a large amount of heat due to friction between the projectile and the rails. This heat causes the", "\n\nHuman: If the color black is good at retaining heat, and white isn't. Why people that live in hotter places tend to have darker skin, and people living in colder places have lighter skin tones?\n\nWouldn't that make people have higher/lower body temperatures when they need the opposite?\n\nAssistant: The reason for this is due to the way our skin reacts to sunlight. People with darker skin have more melanin, which helps protect their skin from the harmful effects of the sun's rays. This is important in hotter regions where the sun's intensity is stronger, and there is a higher risk of sunburn and skin", "\n\nHuman: ow does fruit get sweeter as it ripens on my counter?\n\nOne week it is bland and tart and the next it is rich and sweet with seemingly no outside influence.

In the last week, there's a fake news that a major Bank is collapsing that has constantly been circulated on Facebook. Since the banking industry has just saw the boom after decades of military rule, most people started to save money at banks. The people have very limited knowledge of how banks work. So do I! I want to explain them that why banks couldn't be collapsed right away and no need to withdraw money. This bank is now confronting many people who are attempting to withdraw their cashes. \n\nExcuse my Bad English.\n\nAssistant: A bank can collapse for various reasons, but the most common reason is when the bank experiences a significant loss of assets or a lack of liquidity. This means that the bank does not have enough money to meet the demands of its customers, such as when many people try to withdraw their money at the same time. \n\nHowever", "\n\nHuman: I find that, in general, people in Western societies tend to be very selective in who they invite in gatherings and will often not make their invitations open to people outside their social circle.

Is this an effect of drinking alcohol or is this just my perception? \n\n\nMy eyes aren't bloodshot, so I dont think its a contrast thing, and nothing else appears brighter, so I'm disinclined to think its a change in perception of all color.  That said, I've never been struck by someone else's eyes looking brighter, but then I also dont see someone go from sober to tipsy immediately so a gradual change wouldn't be striking. Is there something about alcohol consumption that would make eyes seem brighter? Or is this just drunk people perception changes and nothing physically happening to my eyeballs?\n\nAssistant: There is no scientific evidence to suggest that alcohol consumption makes eyes appear brighter or more vibrant. It is possible that this is simply a perception change that occurs when a person is under the influence of alcohol. Alcohol can affect the brain and perception, leading to altered perceptions of color, brightness, and other visual cues.

In my (maybe na\u00efve) view of how things *should* be, there would just be a fixed amount of money, forever.\n\nOne way of making the amount of money fixed would be to use something there is a limited amount of, like gold.  I thought that coins/notes basically represented gold somewhere because we didn't want to carry gold everywhere.  However, I'm told that we no longer use a gold currency, so *money can be printed with no effort* \u2026\n\n\u2026 This seems crazy! Doesn't this mean that the printers (governments..?) can just print themselves money?  How does this not steal value from whatever money I own?  When they print more money, where does it go?  They don't give it to me \u2026 or do they?\n\n*Why and how did this happen?!*  It seems like a massive step backwards and makes nonsense of how I thought capitalism worked.  Why did people start accepting some currency the other person could just print more of; isn't this really stupid?\n\nAssistant: Printing money is not stealing because the value of money is not fixed to a physical commodity like gold. In a modern economy, the value of money is determined by the supply and demand for it. When the government prints more money, it increases the supply of money, which can lead to inflation if the demand for goods and", "\n\nHuman: ow can we produce (supposedly) exact figures of the amount of animals remaining of an endangered species?\n\nAssistant: There are several methods used to estimate the population of endangered species, including:\n\n1.

When we speak, our vocal cords vibrate and produce sound waves at various frequencies, which are captured by a microphone when our voice is recorded.\n\nClaim 2: We do not", "\n\nHuman: Why does Twitter need a fleet of 3,600 employees to make a website and phone app to share 140 characters?\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I do not have access to Twitter's internal operations and decision-making processes. However, I can speculate that Twitter requires a large workforce to manage various aspects of the company, such as software development, marketing, customer support, legal and regulatory compliance, and financial management. Additionally, Twitter is a", "\n\nHuman: ow would a radio transmission from a planet with a significant gravitational field work?\n\nI was talking with a bunch of friends about relativity and Interstellar and he asked what would happen if the crew on the planet that was 20 earth years per hour attempt to communicate with their station that did not experience the time difference. \n\nWould they only send static or would the radio waves experience the time difference too?\n\nAssistant: Radio waves would be affected by the gravitational field of the planet, causing a phenomenon known as gravitational redshift. This means that the frequency of the radio waves would decrease as they travel away from the planet, making them harder to detect and potentially causing interference or static in the transmission.\n\nIn the scenario described, the crew on", "\n\nHuman: Why multiple processors vs one larger processor\n\nSo these days the new generations of both CPUs and GPUs are integrating more cores/processor cores. So Why is this a better approach vs having one or just a few larger cores if multi-tasking is the concern? \n\nIn my uneducated opinion, each more core introduces more over heads; and typically the more cores there are, the more difficult it is to raise the clock speed. \n\nIf it's a thermal issue, the transistors can just be laid out in a larger foot print; \n\nIf it's for scalability, one larger processor can still take more tasks and let different parts of itself process them if its engineering this way.\n\nIs this more a marketing scheme? Because I bet for 95% of the consumer market, 4 highly clocked cores are enough. But both AMD and Intel are pushing more cores to the main stream market.\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons why multiple processors are preferred over one larger processor:\n\n1. Parallel processing: Multiple processors allow for parallel processing, which means that multiple tasks can be executed simultaneously. This can result in faster processing times and increased efficiency.\n\n2. Scalability: Multiple processors can be added as needed to increase processing power,", "\n\nHuman: Massive earthquake coming in the NW\n\nI keep hearing about this, but media can be so sensational these days, it's hard to know if all the hype about this is real or not.\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to predict future events or interpret news sources. It is important to stay informed and rely on credible sources for information about potential natural disasters. It is also important to be prepared and have an emergency plan in place in case of any emergency situations.", "\n\nHuman: why don't we have two hearts?\n\nOur bodies are pretty symmetrical. We have two of each limb and two of most organs. The evolutionary advantage is pretty obvious: if one lung/kidney/ fails, you can live with the other. But given the heart is one of the most vital organs, and one of the organs most susceptible to problems, surely two hearts would give a huge evolutionary advantage. So why have no animals evolved to have two hearts?\n\nAssistant: There are a few reasons why animals haven't evolved to have two hearts. Firstly, the heart is a very complex organ, and having two of them would require a significant amount of energy and resources to develop and maintain. This may not be worth the evolutionary advantage, as other adaptations may be more beneficial.\n\nSecondly,", "\n\nHuman: Explain: Monty Hall Proble\n\nAssistant: The Monty Hall Problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show called \"Let's Make a Deal,\" hosted by Monty Hall. The problem involves three doors, behind one of which is a valuable prize (such as a car), and behind the other two are less valuable prizes (such as goats).

However, as of 2013, when Kevin Rudd returned as Prime Minister, there was a significant upheaval in Australian politics. Many ministers resigned in protest, including former Prime Minister Julia Gill", "\n\nHuman: Why do some states, like Ohio, determine the outcome of a presidential election more than others?\n\nAssistant: Some states, like Ohio, are considered \"swing states\" or \"battleground states\" because their voting patterns are less predictable than other states. These states have a relatively equal number of Republican and Democratic voters, and their electoral votes can swing either way in a close election. As a result, presidential candidates spend more", "\n\nHuman: If the observable universe is 90 billion light years in diameter, how can it be 13.82 billion years old and have originated from a single point without parts of the universe moving faster than the speed of light?\n\nAssistant: This is a common misconception about the Big Bang theory. The universe did not originate from a single point, but rather from a state of extremely high density and temperature. This state is often referred to as the \"initial singularity,\" but it is not a point in space. \n\nAs for the issue of parts of the", "\n\nHuman: how (big) ancient cities, like Babylon, became deserted?\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons why ancient cities like Babylon became deserted:\n\n1. Natural disasters: Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and droughts could cause the destruction of ancient cities, making them uninhabitable.\n\n2. War and invasion: Ancient cities were often targets of war and invasion, leading to destruction and displacement of", "\n\nHuman: ow did people hundreds of years ago know if food was safe to eat?\n\nHow did people in the past (american colonists, native americans, etc.) determine if a new food they discovered was safe to eat.  Were there any tests they used or was it more like \"Here, Bob, eat this\" and then waiting to see if Bob got sick or died.\n\nAssistant: People hundreds of years ago relied on their senses and knowledge passed down from previous generations to determine if food was safe to eat. They would look at the appearance, smell, and taste of the food to determine if it was fresh and not spoiled. They also relied on their knowledge of plants and animals to know which ones were", "\n\nHuman: If humanity we\u2019re to disappear, how long would it take the earth to return to a state of \u2018pre-humans\u2019\n\n[removed]\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I cannot predict the exact time it would take for the Earth to return to a state of \"pre-humans\" as it depends on various factors such as the extent of human impact on the environment, the rate of natural processes, and the possibility of other species evolving and taking over.", "\n\nHuman: What would happen if a container was opened and closed in space... then brought back to Earth? What would be inside?\n\nI don't understand very much about space, space physics, etc. so I have no idea what would happen.\n\nHere's my hypothetical: If you opened a container (let's say a tupperware box) in space, closed it after a few minutes, brought it back down to earth, and opened it... what would be inside?\n\nWould nothing be inside and air just get sucked into the box? I'm assuming whatever gas inside the box before opening it would be lost after being exposed in space. I'm expecting a very simple answer and I'm probably just very stupid.\n\nEdit: Awesome! Thank you for all the answers and everyone who has contributed to the discussion; I didn't realize that I wasn't the only one who didn't understand \"space dynamics\" very well. Your collective responses have been amazing and understandable.\n\nAssistant: When you open the container in space, any gas or air inside it will rush out due to the lack of pressure. If you close the container quickly enough, some air will still be inside, but it will be at a lower pressure than on Earth. When you bring the container back to Earth, the air inside will", "\n\nHuman: - how do flu strains vs flu shots battle it out?\n\nAssistant: Flu strains and flu shots do not battle it out in the traditional sense. Flu shots are designed to help protect against specific strains of the flu virus by providing the body with a weakened or dead version of the virus, which helps the immune system develop a response to the virus without causing illness. \n\nFlu strains,", "\n\nHuman: If a woman is born with millions of eggs, why do women go through menopause? Shouldn\u2019t there be a lot of eggs left?\n\nWhat happens to the other unused eggs? I\u2019m a female and don\u2019t know this.\n\nAssistant: Women go through menopause because the number of eggs in their ovaries is depleted over time. As a woman ages, the quality and quantity of her eggs decline, making it more difficult to conceive. Menopause typically occurs when a woman's ovaries stop producing estrogen, which is necessary for ovulation.\n\nWhile women are", "\n\nHuman: What technological advancements have occured for the 5G mobile network to be so much faster than it's predecessor?\n\nAssistant: The 5G mobile network is faster than its predecessor because of several technological advancements, including:\n\n1.

Islamic extremists who carry out violent attacks aim to spread fear, create chaos and destabilize society, and impose their ideology on others. They believe that their actions will lead to a global Islamic state and the destruction of", "\n\nHuman: Transistor Switching Speeds\n\nI understand how a transistor can switch on and off unbelievably fast, and I get the concept of doping for an N or P to create the transistor. But I don't get what is causing the switching in the first place. For a transistor to switch, a current has to be applied to the base, and removed for the transistor to switch back. So for a transistor to be able to switch hundreds of millions of times per second, then something has to be able to apply and remove that base current hundreds of millions of times per second as well. I get that down the line a transistor will feed another one and so on, so that explains how they can switch so fast further down the circuit, but what causes the very first transistor to switch faster than anything we can possibly fathom?\n\nAssistant: The switching speed of a transistor is determined by the time it takes for the charge carriers (electrons and holes) to move across the base region. When a voltage is applied to the base, it creates a depletion region between the base and emitter, which allows the charge carriers to move from the emitter to the collector.", "\n\nHuman: ow in cold weather, we are able to see our breath come out white, how come we do not see this when we fart?\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences or beliefs, but I can provide scientific information. \n\nWhen we see our breath in cold weather, it's because the warm, moist air from our lungs meets the cold air outside and condenses into visible droplets.

What would the process to renationalise be, and what would happen if we did?\n\nAssistant: Renationalising the railways, energy companies, and other industries would involve taking them back into public ownership and control. This would require a significant amount of money and resources to purchase the assets and infrastructure from the private companies that currently own them.\n\nOne of the main arguments against renationalisation is the potential cost to taxpayers.", "\n\nHuman: Gnats. Why do they buzz around and annoy me without biting? What is their purpose?\n\nAssistant: Gnats are small flying insects that are often found in moist environments. They do not bite humans, but they can be annoying as they tend to fly around people's faces and eyes. The purpose of gnats is to serve as a food source for other animals, such as birds and fish. They also play a", "\n\nHuman: The human circulatory system and why bodies bleed when we get small cuts even if it's not hitting one of the veins or arteries\n\nAssistant: The human circulatory system is responsible for carrying oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body and removing waste products.

The main reasons for their entry were: \n\n1. Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare against American ships, including the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915, which killed 128 Americans.\n\n2. The Zimmerman Telegram, in", "\n\nHuman: Why doesn't every American citizen pay the same percentage of income in taxtes?\n\nSuppose the government taxed every citizen 20% of their income. Why wouldn't that work?\n\nAssistant: There are several reasons why every American citizen doesn't pay the same percentage of income in taxes:\n\n1. Progressive taxation: The U.S. tax system is designed to be progressive, meaning that people with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. This is based on the idea that those who can afford to", "\n\nHuman: Why, after a poor night of sleep and subsequent all-day fatigue, do I get a \u201csecond wind\u201d of energy that night with no interest in going to bed?\n\nAssistant: This phenomenon is known as a \"second wind,\" and it happens because the body's natural sleep-wake cycle gets disrupted when we don't get enough sleep. When we experience fatigue during the day, our body's natural response is to conserve energy and slow down. However, when we push through that fatigue and stay active", "\n\nHuman: ow is 4chan/anon able to track down and find out all the things/people they have done in the past?\n\nFor example you post a photo saved from Facebook and they can find your profile within minutes\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I cannot speculate on the exact methods used by 4chan/anon to track down and find out information about individuals.

Additionally, some stores", "\n\nHuman: What happens inside my body when I crack my knuckles/other joints? Will it really cause me to get arthritis later in life?\n\nAssistant: When you crack your knuckles or other joints, you are creating a vacuum in the joint space. This vacuum causes the release of gas bubbles that are dissolved in the joint fluid, producing the popping sound you hear. The act of cracking your joints itself is not harmful or dangerous. However, if you crack your joints excessively", "\n\nHuman: If particles move faster when heated, why does moving air make me feel cooler?\n\nAssistant: Moving air makes you feel cooler because it helps to evaporate the moisture on your skin, which is one of the ways that your body cools itself. When air moves over your skin, it carries away the thin layer of warm air that surrounds your body, which helps to increase the evaporation of sweat on your skin", "\n\nHuman: Why do some music chords and intervals sound consonant while others sound dissonant\n\nAnd why some chords that are supposed to sound dissonant sound consonant in a song?\n\nAssistant: The perception of consonance and dissonance in music is based on the relative frequencies of the notes being played. Consonant intervals and chords have frequencies that are harmonically related, meaning their frequencies are simple ratios of each other. For example, the interval of a perfect fifth has a frequency ratio of 3:", "\n\nHuman: how do animals that are born with 2 heads live? Does each head have a consciousness of its own?\n\nAssistant: Animals born with two heads, also known as polycephaly, can survive depending on the severity of their condition and the species they belong to.

This medication is  < medicationame >  HCL, meaning it has hydrochloride in it. The part that confuses me is that there is also a version of my medication WITHOUT the HCL.\n\nAre some people allergic to HCL? \n\nPlease please please keep explanations as simple as possible. My husband was a chemistry major and every time he tries to explain it goes over my head too much, as do the links he dragged up via google.\n\nI know it's technically a chemistry question, but really, I just need the bottom line, not necessarily all the chemistry stuff that goes into it.. I have never even taken basic Chemistry yet (heck, i haven't even taken Intro to Bio yet), but this is my health we're talking about.. I'd like to be informed.\n\nAssistant: The reason some medications have both an HCL and non-HCL version is because the HCL form is more stable and easier to work with during the manufacturing process, while the non-HCL form may be more easily absorbed by the body. This means that some people may have a better response to one form over the other", "\n\nHuman: Why are veterans held in such high regard in america and why do some veterans walk around in uniform when not on duty?\n\nAssistant: Veterans are held in high regard in America because of their sacrifice and service to the country.
