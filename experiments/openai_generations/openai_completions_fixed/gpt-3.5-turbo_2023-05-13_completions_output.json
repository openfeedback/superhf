        "\n\nHuman: Why do some people really enjoy watching so-called \"tortureporn\" movies? (Saw, Hostel, etc.)\n\nThere is a genre of horror films, apparently dating back to at least the 1950s, that focuses on the torture and mutilation of people.  Modern films in this area include the *Saw* franchise and Eli Roth's *Hostel*, among others.  I am specifically not referring to horror films that use gore in a comedic, slapstick, or tongue-in-cheek way. \n\nI understand that these films are still art, in that they push the envelope of social taboos against depicting violence and/or the human body.  And I understand that some of the movies have at least an attempt to include an intellecutal element - for example, the *Saw* movies have, at their core, at least *attempt* to examine individual morality.  So, I understand that these films have some sort of artistic purpose, and I don't think that the making of these films is immoral or anything.  I am not advocating that they should be banned.  I don't think the producers or actors or writers are bad people, either.   \n\nBut I also recognize that these films make a lot of freakin' money, and I don't understand that.  I don't believe that the popularity of the *Saw* movies has anything to do with their loose attempt to raise questions about human morality.  And other tortureporn movies don't even attempt to do anything intellectual - they're just blood, pain, and screaming.  I think that the popularity of these movies is connected with something else, something more prurient and immediate and less cerebral.  But I don't get it.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why people find these movies enjoyable *to watch.*  Even if you agree that these movies serve an artistic function, why would anyone pay for expensive movie tickets to sit in a dark theater for two hours and watch human beings get tortured?  It would be more understandable if these were short art pieces, designed to make the viewer uncomfortable and to poke at human psyche - you go in, you watch something awful for 15 minutes, you leave and think about what you've just seen.  I could understand it if these films were nonfiction, or based on true stories, because they would be telling a truth about the world.  But these are long-form fictional films.  \n\nWhy do some people want to watch scene after extremely violent scene? Some of these movies don't even end on a cathartic, up-beat note - what's the point?  Why do that to yourself?  We have limited lifespans, why spend any of that watching this sort of fictional brutality?  It seems like an awful use of time to me. \n\nSomeone please explain the appeal of watching these films, I don't get it.  \n\n(Note: I have not seen any of these movies, but I have read scripts excerpts and plot summaries, and I've read articles about them.  I've also been exposed to short clips and things of that nature.  No, my information does not come from weirdo religious or \"family values\" groups that oppose these movies on moral grounds.)\n\n**edit: I have an answer that satisfies me, thanks to /u/redditorf's comment [here](_URL_0_): the concept of \"morbid curiosity\", which apparently has been studied by actual psychologists and scientists and whatnot.  I think people's natural morbid curiosity probably drives them to see these movies, and I just happen to be an outlier in my response to the same films.

Now don't get me wrong, my Mom is a very loving and understanding person, but no matter how many times I've tried to explain the situation to her she continues to think my cousins actions are defiance as a product of bad parenting. Normally we see him around the holidays, but this year due to a defunct relationship with his Mother and the rest of the family I probably won't see him. For the most part during family gatherings he is quiet, and well behaved. There was however one time when someone turned the channel he was watching, and as a result he completely lost his shit. Other than that he's been completely fine around the family. When this does happen my Mom can always be quoted saying something to me like \"If that were my kid he wouldn't be acting like that.\" I've tried explaining it to her in many ways already, and to no avail. So I ask you to give me a way to explain it so that even my Mom can understand!

These switches are the basic building blocks of all digital devices, such as computers and smartphones. \n\nWhile",
        "\n\nHuman: Why wont nuclear weapons have an effect on an incoming asteroid?\n\nI understand the fact that a nuclear weapon, or any other measure that employs a direct effect on an Asteroid will not stop the asteroid's energy, as most of the energy will come from the asteroids speed.\n\nBut would the effect of a nuclear weapon exploding on or near the asteroid not degrade the asteroid as a whole? For a random rock to be frozen to near 0 in interstellar space to possibly thousands of degrees back to near 0 in a few seconds, would this not damage the structural integrity of the asteroid as a whole?\nFor arguments sake if an Asteroid is 1 km wide and a is broken up into 1000 1 metre wide pieces all travelling on the same trajectory, in a clustered group, it has pretty much the same energy when it hits Earth correct?\nNow how far apart would those separate rocks need to be blasted away from each other before physics treats them as separate impacts on the atmosphere rather then 1 shotgun type blast? Hypothetically If enough nuclear weapons were detonated would the shockwaves not eventually turn the asteroid into a fast moving cloud of dust.\n\nAlways wondered this, thanks.\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I cannot speak for all the hijacked passengers, but there are several reasons why people may not fight back in such situations:\n\n1.

        "\n\nHuman: Why is sound for TV and movies barely audible for dialog and eat drum exploding for music and action?\n\nNowadays I can't watch TV or movies without the remote in my hand to raise and lower the volume between scenes. I eventually turned on subtitles full time so I could read dialog so the explosion in the next scene doesn't scare the neighbors. I'd assume during editing, someone watched their show or movie and decided this was okay? Is there some benefit that I'm not realizing?\n\nAssistant: Cantonese and Mandarin both use the same writing system, which is based on Chinese characters. This is because the writing system was standardized during the Qin dynasty (221-206 BCE) and has remained largely unchanged since then.\n\nHowever, the spoken languages of Cantonese and Mandarin developed separately over time, with different regional dialect",
        "\n\nHuman: Why are sites that basically just take government records and upload them online allowed to exist?\n\nSo, I've noticed recently that basically every time that I try to search for myself recently (I do it periodically to check whether a potential employer would run across my personal Reddit account or something) I get like 20 responses from sites that basically just dump the government's records of my address and contact information onto a webpage and put ads on them. I try to periodically sweep through and ask as many as possible to remove the records, but my question is: why are they allowed to exist monetarily? Is it just that no one cares, or is there a legitimate reason why making public documents google searchable is considered a valid business model? \n\nAssistant: Google's \"index of\" search works by looking for directories on web servers that are not explicitly hidden or password-protected. These directories may contain files that are not intended for public access, but are still accessible if the directory is not properly secured. \n\nThese websites cannot be found by normal search because they are not meant",

        "\n\nHuman: How are traditional film-based movies duplicated for mass distribution?\n\nI know that film is film. It begins as a raw product, it's put in to a camera and becomes exposed, the film is developed, and then hits the cutting room, where the director selects scenes to cut and stich together into a movie.  So now the movie is made. Presumably, there's a master cut.  I've always wondered, how is that master cut duplicated?  Film isn't digital or even electronic.  You can't push the image to hundreds of recievers like you can a VCR tape to hundreds of VCR's or DVD to thousands of DVD burning devices.  \nHow is a film efficiently duplicated thousands of times for mass distribution?  \n(The presumption to this question is that we're filming a movie with traditional film for traditional distribution to the projection-based theater.  I know that's very uncommon today, but my understanding is that, even Tarantino's Hateful Eight was originally distributed on film.)\n\nAssistant: Snapchat's valuation is based on its potential for future revenue and growth.

        "\n\nHuman: what exactly was accomplished with every trip to the Moon, except for the first one?\n\nI think the question is pretty straightforward, but to briefly explain where I'm coming from: people frequently talk of \"putting a man on the Moon\" as one of the most significant accomplishments of our times. But I was talking about technology with someone on /r/AskSocialScience, got lost in thought, and began asking myself the following questions: why do you want to go to the Moon anyway? What is that meant to accomplish, apart from the fact that you put a man on the Moon?\n\nIt's accepted knowledge that building a spaceship that successfully lands someone on the Moon is a massive accomplishment, and by that we automatically assume that the endeavor was worthwhile in and of itself (perhaps because of the massive value we, as a society, give science and technology).\n\nNow, I completely understand the value of doing it once: you get to collect samples, take some sick pics, and you get to say that humanity has finally left the planet (although the reason why we need to leave the planet remains unexplained, at least to me - it really seems like a case of \"if you can, you should\"). But how about every subsequent trip? What was the point of those? What was accomplished? Was it done to stick it to the Russians?\n\n(Just to clarify - I am not a conspiracy theorist, I think that's really stupid, and Buzz Aldrin was right to punch that dude.)\n\nAssistant: Blind people use several methods to differentiate between US dollar bills of the same size, including:\n\n1.

I think the following quote from /u/popsumpot describes the role China played in WW2 perfectly:\n\n > It is fairly evident that the Japanese occupation in China was a bloodbath. It is often under-looked in history as a theatre of war. The reality is, China is to the Pacific theatre as Russia was to the European theatre. Both these countries paid enormous tolls in blood and soil in order to tie up the vast majority of German and Japanese forces respectively. It is estimated that Japan lost 2 million fighting men in China alone (At the height of its size, the Imperial Japanese Army did not number much more than 5 million), while the Russians fought around 80% of German forces for extended periods of time. It is a shame that these 2 conflicts generally do not get the education and recognition they deserve.\n\nAssistant: The decision of whether or not a word is considered a \"real\" word is ultimately up to the dictionary editors and linguists who study language.

        "\n\nHuman: Why are public schools allowed to enforce rules such as a strict dress code, confiscation of personal property, and restrictions of freedom of speech?\n\nI'm sitting here at a friend's graduation, thinking back on my own high school experience (I graduated in 2013). I'm just remembering all the absurd rules we had at my Highschool, all of which seem like they would violate some sort of personal freedom.\n\nExamples:\n- No use of cell phones. At my high school, if you were seen using your phone even between class periods and at lunch, teachers would take your phone. They would then turn it into the front office, where it had to stay overnight, and then the next morning you could pay $15 to get it back. If you didn't pay to get it back, they would throw it away after a month or so. \n\n-Dress code: No facial hair on men unless religious beliefs prevented you from shaving. \n\n- Dress code: Girls couldn't wear skirts/dresses that were shorter than their extended finger tips when their hands were by their sides.\n\n- Dress code: Guys couldn't wear tank tops, and girls couldn't wear spaghetti straps. The rule was that (for girls, since guys were outright banned from tank tops) if the strap wasn't 3 fingers wide, it was out of dress code.\n\n- Dress code: Guys were forbidden to wear earrings, necklaces, or rings. If caught wearing these they would be confiscated. \n\n- Dress code: Girls couldn't die their hair any unnatural color. \n\n- Dress code: No hats were allowed. The hoods of hoodies could not be worn. \n\n- Most things that were published in our school paper were heavily watched and if anything was said that the administration didn't like, it would be removed from the school paper (I have a friend who wrote for the paper and some of his writings were removed before printing).\n\n- No food from outside the school. No eating or drinking in class\n\nIf any part of the dress code was broken, you would be written up and sent home for the day. \n\nHow the hell is it legal for schools to do this? Many of these impinge on the freedoms that we are granted as american citizens. \n\nEdit: Yes It was a public school and I went to school on Texas\nEdit 2: Obviously only 1 or 2 of these seem to violate free speech in a way. Don't get your panties in a wad. I also say they \"seem\" to impinge on freedoms because I don't actually know, that's why I'm asking you guys\n\nFinal edit: I really appreciate those of you who kindly responded and gave your insight! Some of these answers I should've probably deduced using simple logic but at the time of writing it I was just in a pessimistic mood towards high school and it almost turned into a vent session. And I enjoy reading the discussions it brings up.

And after working, or even studying, in the country for, say 5 years, they can apply for citizenship.\n\nConsidering this isn't how things currently are, I'd like to know what would actually happen (short term and long term) if we did switch to such a system. \n\nEdit: by long term effects, I'm wondering what kind of equilibrium we'd end up with, given enough time.\n\nEDIT 2: Plenty of eye opening aspects to this issue have been mentioned here and I see how the visa system keeps things in control. I guess I didn't take enough time to think this through. The reason I started thinking about this was a couple crazy incidents I've witnessed. \n\nIn one case, a family who applied for a visa to a European Country. The parents and one child (under 18) got residency visas while the second child (18+ and applied for a uni in that country) was denied.\n\nThe other case was a family I came across at a US embassy where a father and his children got visit visas but the mother's application was denied and the family was understandably very upset (considering any visa rejection makes you likely to be denied in the future). From their conversation, it seemed they were going for a relative's wedding in the US.\n\nIt's unfair on them, but I see the rational side of having visas and the \"hurdles\".\n\nThanks.\n\nAssistant: Sports photographers use still cameras instead of video and screenshot for several reasons:\n\n1.

Why are so many people left with nothing after severe storms?\n\nI know many people are left with nothing and are completely broke following severe weather (e.g. hurricanes, tornadoes, etc.). As a disclaimer, I don't believe they're trying to scam anyone in any way and support relief efforts. \n\nI'm confused as to why homeowners insurance doesn't compensate them for their losses (in the U.S. specifically). Mortgages require you to have homeowners insurance. So most people have it. But apparently it doesn't do anything? They just sort of turn their back on the people they've promised to insure? \n\n*EDIT: Basic homeowners insurance covers wind damage (like from a tornado or hurricane) and rain damage. It does not cover damage from flooding, earthquakes, or sink holes. \n\nSame question for businesses. I've heard of businesses being unable to reopen because they've lost too much following a storm. Why isn't their insurance covering their lost business, destroyed merchandise, and damaged storefront? Again, commercial insurance is often required, and it covers all the aforementioned losses to varying degrees.  \n\nTheories:  \n- Most people don't actually have homeowners or commercial insurance.  \n- Insurance takes a long time to receive, and most people don't have emergency funds or friends/family they can stay with in the event their home is destroyed.  \n- Insurance only reimburses homeowners for a tiny amount of what people actually lose.  \n\nAssistant: Your father is correct.

After a quick dive through Wikipedia my mind is racing with questions. \n\n* I have no idea how these tiny enzimes actually work? \n* What's inside an enzyme? \n* How does something so small perform what looks like a totally programmed robotic assembly line? \n* Do the \"bits\" just \"float\" around until they bump into eachother and have some sort of reaction?\n* Do the enzyme(s) have to wait for these building blocks to become available? So the process could take longer/shorter depending on available \"material\"? Or are they floating in a sea of \"bits\" and have no trouble finding \"material\" to perform this replication?\n* \"some DNA polymerases also have proofreading ability\" - I'm unsure what the \"some\" part is referring to. Like only some of the cells in our body have proofreading? Or like humans do but mice don't? \n* My \"LI5\" understanding of cell replication is these enzymes duplicate DNA in one cell and then that cell splits in half, etc... Is it this DNA replication that is pushing the cell apart (like blowing up a balloon until it pops)? \n* In the animation, what are the different colored parts called?\n* In the animation, it looks like the green stuff comes in and gets used a bit then discarded.

However, sometimes the missile's sensors can be confused by decoys or countermeasures, causing",
        "\n\nHuman: What runs an operating system? How is an operating system developed?\n\nThis kind of hurts my brain to think about, so bear with me as I try my best to explain I mean.\n\nWe have things like C, C++, Java, which act as languages for computers. There's usually a software that you input into, which has its own lovely UI. But the foundation, or the \"base\" for the language to be written, read, or created, is the operating system itself. It's the platform that allows it to run. No operating system = no program to write or read languages.\n\nSo what, then, is used to create said platform? Was the first OS with a functional UI made by randomly inputting 0's and 1's until presto!- something just clicked and worked? Did they hole-punch a card and input it into a machine which read it as a language?\n\nAnd for that matter, after the OS is created, how is it ran? What runs it? Like, if the operating system is the platform that reads and executes programs like Chrome, what reads and understands an operating system? Like if you go into Windows System32, I'm sure most of the DLLs and random files are being read by the operating itself, but what does the machine read and how does it know how to read it?\n\nI don't think I made any sense.\n\nBasically I'm thinking that the machine is independent of the OS which is independent of the programs that it runs. I understand that programs are developed in an OS because the UI makes it easy to launch programs and input commands and codes, and the OS reads those codes which can be executed, and the machine itself is simply hardware. The operating system itself, however, can't be created by booting up Notepad.exe to write a bunch of codes. There probably wasn't even a standard language when the first OS with UI was written. So what created it?\n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences or emotions to understand the behavior of snails.

This layer of water forms a strong bond with the surface of your fingers due to surface tension, causing the ice to stick",
        "\n\nHuman: Why do modern touchscreens not have to be calibrated constantly like old ones did?\n\nI remember back on older stylus-type touchscreens such as a Nintendo DS, the screen would occasionally become out of calibration (you would touch one spot, and it would click a different point), and you would need to recalibrate the screen by touching specific points on the screen.\n\nWhy don't you have to do this on modern touchscreens like an iPhone, most tablets, etc.?\n\nI know that older touchscreens used actual touch sensors, while modern screens use some sort of electron sensor (which is why you can't use just anything as a stylus on an iPhone, like you could on a DS).  Does this have anything to do with it?  What makes the new system so much more reliable?\n\nThanks!  This just hit me earlier while my professor was teaching using a Surface, and I was remembering the old days of calibrating Smartboards and DS's.\n\nAssistant: The double-slit experiment with electrons shows that particles can exhibit wave-like behavior.

        "\n\nHuman: How do spinning centrifuge type space stations create artificial gravity?\n\nI just finished reading Rendezvous with Rama, and I was wondering about the artificial gravity system. In he book, the as the crew get farther from the center, their perceived gravity increases. But I don't know why that would be the case.\n\nLet's say you're in this rotating space ship. You then jump off the ground. Wouldn't you simply float in that same spot and the space station would just keep rotating under your feet, and you would be weightless?\n\nOn Halo for example, the ring is stationary but spinning, and you come up alongside it. You should just see the thing spinning, but it wouldn't rightly have any affect on your gravity. So then you fly your spaceship over the ring, wouldn't you just continue floating there and see the ring spinning just as it was when you were beside it?\n\nSorry if this isn't explained properly.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nIn a rotating artificial gravity space ship, wouldn't jumping off the ground free you from the artificial gravity?\n\nAssistant: An astronaut's space suit is designed to withstand the vacuum of space.

        "\n\nHuman: Why is writing zeros (or 1s or random characters) one time not sufficient for formatting hard drives?\n\nSo, it is common when disposing of a computer or hard drive to wipe the data so it can't be recovered, I do this as part of my daily job often. Most hard drive wiping applications (DBAN, etc.) have several options such as the number of passes and what type of data to write to the drive (1s, 0s, random, etc.). What I don't understand from a technical standpoint is why multiple passes or different types of data are needed. Wouldn't writing all zeros (or whatever) to every sector of the drive be sufficient for removing all data and any hope of a recovery? I've never understood this but really didn't care until a client just asked me and I really didn't have an answer. I've searched for a good explanation of this and the best answer I can find is \"so your data can't be recovered\", but I can't seem to find a good technical reason for this. If I wrote over an entire hard drive with all zeros, how could anything possibly be recovered? \n\nAssistant: As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences or feelings to determine which tasks are easier or harder for humans.
