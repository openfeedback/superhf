Assuming they don't have a family member or roommate.", "completion": "Well, I think that's a bit of a gray area.

Well, to narrow it down, I have this idea that Platonism, Neoplatonism, philosophers of Alexandria, Pythagoras, Judaism, Christianity, Descartes etc pretty much all tell that soul and body are separate things, soul is above, body is below and is dependent on the soul, a kind of disdain for physical nature of things and the senses etc etc. But I don't have a good definition of monism. What is it in opposition to that? (Please don't make it encyclopaedic or too complicated, ELI5)", "completion": "Well, I'll try to explain it in terms you can understand. Firstly, you should know that in the early 1900s, there were two ideas in philosophy that were trying to explain how the mind works. The first idea was that the mind was an emergent property of the brain, a little like the emergent property of heat in a gas. This is the idea behind the phrase “the brain is the mind.” This idea is called materialism. The other idea was that the mind was an immaterial thing that existed independently of the brain. This is called dualism."}

It seems like it has been like that for years.  Their economies seem to be quite different yet the exchange rate is almost always near 1.", "completion": "Well, it is because both countries have a free-floating currency system, meaning their currency is not pegged to another currency, so their exchange rate is determined by the supply and demand of each currency in the market.  This allows the two currencies to stay relatively equal in value to each other."}

Or is it the government? Or does it vary depending on each situation?", "completion": "I think it's mostly the company, not the government.  The company has more incentive to act quickly, and they are also more likely to have the resources to track the issue down.

Here’s a paper from 2010 that looks at this, and the authors come to the conclusion that milk from cows treated with rbST is not different than milk from cows not treated with rbST.

Why is, say, a high-C played on a flute heard better than a closing door?", "completion": "Because the flute creates a higher frequency sound wave than a closing door.  The human ear is more sensitive to higher frequency sound waves, which is why a high-C on a flute is heard better than a closing door.

It seems like it has been like that for years.

The industry has low profit margins, so it can be difficult for small businesses to stay afloat. Many restaurants and bars rely on loyal customers and word of mouth to survive and thrive.

Or when I get a crink in my neck and my forehead starts hurting as if I was laying down and dropped my phone on my face.  I realize that these parts are close enough physically and in function that if one part hurts then the other might, but why is it that the unhurt part hurts more than the hurt part?", "completion": "Because the nerve endings in the human body are interconnected, when one part is injured or in pain, it can cause other parts to be sensitive or even hurt. The sensation may be referred pain, meaning the pain is not coming from the location of the original injury, but from another part of the body.  This is why a headache can cause pain in the neck and shoulders, or why a sprained ankle can cause pain in the knee."}

Are some of our mountains still growing?", "completion": "Mountains are formed through tectonic plates pushing each other and the pressure of the Earth's crust causing rocks to move and shift. Over time, this causes the land to rise and form mountains. Some mountains are still growing, such as volcanic mountains, which continue to grow as lava and ash accumulate."}

I'm sure it varies but maybe it's different when food is recalled versus a car or electronic product. In the case of the food, is it usually the farms that find the issue or is there a division of the company, ex: Tyson chicken, that finds the source of the danger and then calls for a recall? Or is it the government? Or does it vary depending on each situation?", "completion": "What else do you need to know?"}

{"test_set": "openai/webgpt_comparisons", "index": 7, "rating": "9", "model": "shf-7b-default.json", "prompt": "How Do Batteries work", "completion": "Batteries are rechargeable energy storage devices that convert chemical energy into electrical energy. They consist of two electrodes, one positively charged and one negatively charged, and an electrolyte that allows ions to move between the two electrodes. When a electrical current is applied, the ions move between the electrodes, creating an electric field and allowing electrical energy to be stored."}

For example, my sister fell while skiing and hurt her leg. It wasn't broken, but extremely tender and bruised. She took a bath in Epsom salts and the next morning was able to walk on that leg, when she wasn't able to before without severe pain.", "completion": "Epsom salts help to reduce inflammation and promote healing by drawing the excess fluid and toxins out of the injured area. It also helps to increase the circulation to the area, which helps bring more oxygen and nutrients to the cells and helps to promote healing. Additionally, it can help to reduce the pain and discomfort associated with the injury."}

Why is, say, a high-C played on a flute heard better than a closing door?", "completion": "I don't have a definitive answer for this, but I can provide some possible explanations. The frequency of sound waves is one factor that affects how loud a sound is. Higher frequency sounds are generally more intense and can be heard over a wider range. The human ear is more sensitive to higher frequencies, so sounds with a higher pitch are generally louder and more noticeable. The type of sound source and its distance from the listener can also affect how loud it is. A loudspeaker, for example, produces sound waves that travel in a narrow beam and can be heard over a"}

Additionally, some states have programs that allow people on house arrest to receive food and other essential items through a third-party provider."}
{"test_set": "openai/webgpt_comparisons", "index": 12, "rating": "9", "model": "shf-7b-default.json", "prompt": "What's monism? Well, to narrow it down, I have this idea that Platonism, Neoplatonism, philosophers of Alexandria, Pythagoras, Judaism, Christianity, Descartes etc pretty much all tell that soul and body are separate things, soul is above, body is below and is dependent on the soul, a kind of disdain for physical nature of things and the senses etc etc. But I don't have a good definition of monism. What is it in opposition to that? (Please don't make it encyclopaedic or too complicated, ELI5)", "completion": "Monism is the belief that all reality is composed of one single substance, which is usually referred to as the Unified Field. This substance is considered to be immutable and eternal, and it is believed to be the source of all phenomena. Monism is in contrast to dualism, which posits two separate substances, or pluralism, which posits multiple substances. Monism is a core tenet of several religious and philosophical traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and some forms of Christianity."}

The FDA recommends that consumers should carefully weigh the available scientific evidence when making their own decisions about the safety and nutritional value of milk from rbST-treated cows and non-rbST treated cows."}

How come the virus doesn't keep multiplying until it kills the person?", "completion": "The human immune system is able to fight off the virus and limit its spread in the body. The virus is able to enter and infect cells, but the body's immune system is also able to recognize the virus and activate defensive mechanisms to prevent the virus from replicating. In some cases, the body's immune system is able to fight off the virus and the person will recover."}

You often hear how non-corporate bars and restaurants have a very high failure rate, (the usual statistic you hear is 90%), and that the ones that do not fail don't really make much money, so how can millions of them exist under these conditions?", "completion": "Well, many privately owned restaurants and bars receive funding from investors or banks, and they are able to stay afloat despite the high failure rate. Additionally, they may benefit from economies of scale and cost savings from purchasing larger quantities of food and supplies. They may also receive subsidies or grants from local governments to help them stay afloat. Finally, many of these businesses cater to a local customer base and may have loyal customers who keep them afloat."}

The number on the plastic indicates what type of plastic it is, and which process it should go through for recycling. Different plastics can’t be mixed together, so it’s important to make sure the right type of plastic is put in the right bin."}
