Assuming they don't have a family member or roommate.", "completion": "Well, I think that's a bit of a gray area.

Well, to narrow it down, I have this idea that Platonism, Neoplatonism, philosophers of Alexandria, Pythagoras, Judaism, Christianity, Descartes etc pretty much all tell that soul and body are separate things, soul is above, body is below and is dependent on the soul, a kind of disdain for physical nature of things and the senses etc etc. But I don't have a good definition of monism. What is it in opposition to that? (Please don't make it encyclopaedic or too complicated, ELI5)", "completion": "Well, I'll try to explain it in terms you can understand. Firstly, you should know that in the early 1900s, there were two ideas in philosophy that were trying to explain how the mind works. The first idea was that the mind was an emergent property of the brain, a little like the emergent property of heat in a gas. This is the idea behind the phrase “the brain is the mind.” This idea is called materialism. The other idea was that the mind was an immaterial thing that existed independently of the brain. This is called dualism."}

It seems like it has been like that for years.  Their economies seem to be quite different yet the exchange rate is almost always near 1.", "completion": "Well, it is because both countries have a free-floating currency system, meaning their currency is not pegged to another currency, so their exchange rate is determined by the supply and demand of each currency in the market.  This allows the two currencies to stay relatively equal in value to each other."}
