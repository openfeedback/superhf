Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/xglm-4.5B were not used when initializing XGLMModel: ['lm_head.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing XGLMModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing XGLMModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of XGLMModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/xglm-4.5B and are newly initialized: ['model.embed_positions.weights']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
